<h2>Reviewing the Top Free Crypto Giveaways</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/311424/screen-shot-2023-06-05-at.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token airdrop" /></p>

The giveaway will be awarded to 5 entrants, each winner getting $10,000 worth of tokens. To enter the giveaway, entrants can follow the website and follow Wall Street Memes on social media.</p>
<p>While the $WSM token does not offer much utility, it has the backing of a large meme movement. Wall Street Memes has over 1 million followers, and $WSM will be a 100% community token. Half of the 2 billion token supply will be allocated for the presale, consisting of 30 rounds.</p>
<p>The price of $WSM will rise from $0.025 to $0.0337 by the final presale round. Currently, the token is priced at $0.0271. By the final stage, the price will increase to $0.0337. Another 30% of the token supply will be allocated as community rewards. Thus, members stand a chance to generate wealth by entering this crypto project.</p>

<h3>2. AiDoge &#8211; Meme-to-Earn Crypto Bringing a Massive 50 Billion $AI Tokens Giveaway</h3>
<p>Leading the list of the best crypto giveaways this year is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/aidoge/en">AiDoge</a>.

<p>As part of that marketing measure, AiDoge has organized a 50 billion $AI token airdrop where users can earn a portion of it by referring AiDoge to their friends and followers. The process to earn $AI tokens through this way is simple. Users that have taken part in the presale can share the referral code with their friends. The number of tokens bought through that referral code will determine how many tokens users win.</p>
<h4>What is AiDoge?</h4>
<p>AiDoge is a meme-to-earn platform where entering a few text prompts will allow users to generate relatable, quirky, and engagement-worthy memes to post on social media or as their marketing content. But the meme-to-earn aspect comes to play in this ecosystem via the Public Wall.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/311426/aidoge-elon-meme.jpg" alt="AI Doge meme" /></figure>
<p>A Public Wall is a meme-posting system implemented by the AiDoge community in which users can post their memes for all the members of the community to see. These members will vote on these memes and, depending on how many votes a meme gets, the winner will be rewarded with $AI Tokens.</p>
<h4>What is an $AI Token?</h4>
<p>An AI Token is an ERC-20 crypto asset that, in addition to being a reward token, can be used to buy credits to create memes. Other utilities of this token include.</p>
<ol>
<li>Voting on the various matters within the AiDoge ecosystem;</li>
<li>And, staking, a process through which users can earn APYs and other lucrative perks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The token has a total supply of 1 trillion, out of which 500 billion were listed for the presale. AiDoge managed to raise nearly $15 million through its presale round. Now, the token will be listed on crypto exchanges on June 19th, 2023.<br />

<h3>3. DeeLance &#8211; Decentralized Recruitment Platform with a $100k Giveaway</h3>

<h3>4. Tamadoge &#8211; Meme Coin Giving Away $1 Million and Hosting Frequent Competitions</h3>
<p>Meme coin <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge (TAMA)</a> is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn (P2E) crypto project</a> and one of the best NFT games out right now. It tokenizes in-game assets to make them easily tradable and verifiable. Many crypto enthusiasts have praised the project as being one of the best crypto games on the market thanks to its committed team and strong concept.</p>
<figure class="image"><a href="https://tamadoge.io/free-10/"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224043/tama-giveawy.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto project" /></a></figure>
<p>The Tamadoge game is built around a tailor-made Metaverse world commonly referred to as the Tamaverse. In this virtual land, players are able to train NFT-based pets. In order to rank up a pet, the player must interact with it and provide it with food, toys, and cosmetics, all of which are available from the in-game store.</p>
<p>When a player improves the ranking of their pet, they will receive Dogepoints. The more points a player has, the higher they will rank on the in-game leaderboard. As the highest-rated players will receive the greatest share of the rewards pool, there is a huge amount of incentive for people to level up their pets.</p>
<p>Synergizing perfectly with the leveling system, 5% of the revenue generated from the in-game store is burned. This means that by improving their pets by purchasing items from the store, a player also reduces the total supply of TAMA, helping to further boost their earnings.</p>
<p>Following one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best presales</a> of 2022, and having raised $19M, the TAMA token was recently listed on the OKX centralized exchange (CEX) and the OKX DEX (for US residents). To celebrate this achievement, the team has launched a $1 million competition with 100,000 prizes up for grabs. Just register with OKX, trade TAMA/USDT, and complete a few social actions to win $10 sent directly to a crypto wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224027/tama-okx-listing.jpg" alt="Tamadoge OKX listed" /></figure>
<p>Tamadoge is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-games.htm">best crypto games</a> available right now. The project has been enjoying huge demand and with the release of the Tamaverse and Tamadoge pets both slated for Q4 2022, we could see TAMA explode sooner rather than later. Additionally, it&#8217;s also considered a better alternative to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-faucets.htm">best crypto faucets</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Join the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram</a> to stay informed about the project&#8217;s latest updates.<br />
<div class="cta-content-button"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/tamadoge" rel="nofollow noindex noopener sponsored" >Buy Tamadoge on ByBit</a></div>
<h3>5. Battle Infinity &#8211; Popular P2E DeFi Ecosystem Rewarding its Supporters</h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity (IBAT)</a> is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new crypto project </a>that has been making waves in the industry thanks to its unique ecosystem comprising a fantasy sports platform, an NFT marketplace, a decentralized exchange, a staking platform, a collection of some of the best NFT games, and even a Metaverse arena.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224029/battle-infinity-game.jpg" alt="battle infinity crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The project has been performing well in recent months. After selling out its 16,500 BNB presale, beating expectations by 65-days, the IBAT token went on to climb by around 400% compared to its presale price after getting listed on PancakeSwap. With statistics like these, IBAT could be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> right now.,</p>
<p>Following the release of the IBAT staking platform, there has been a lot of focus on the Battle Infinity ecosystem, and for good reason. Out of all the crypto tokens on the market, IBAT is one of the top in terms of potential growth. As the project&#8217;s core features begin to release, we could see the token skyrocket.</p>
<p>To reward its supporters, Battle Infinity has been hosting giveaways on the <a href="https://t.me/battleinfinity">IBAT Telegram channel</a>. The prizes are typically worth between $10 to $500 and can usually be won by completely specific social actions (e.g. following the IBAT Twitter, sharing a post, etc). With new draws being periodically announced, it&#8217;s worth following the Telegram closely to maximize the chances of winning.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224030/ibat-staking-site.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity token staking" /></figure>
<p>Battle Infinity is an extremely interesting project that has the potential to grow exponentially in the coming months. The release of the project&#8217;s fantasy sports league as well as its other primary features will likely cause demand for the IBAT token to boom so it&#8217;s worth watching Battle Infinity closely and keeping an eye on the project&#8217;s Telegram in order to not miss the next best crypto giveaway.<br />

<h3>6. Lucky Block &#8211; NFT Competition Platform Hosting both Paid And Free Prize Draws</h3>
<p>Next on our list of the best crypto giveaways is <a href="https://luckyblock.com/">Lucky Block (LBLOCK)</a>, a crypto-powered platform created to provide a fair and simple way for people to enter NFT-based competitions with huge prizes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224032/lucky-block-website-new.jpg" alt="lucky block website" /></figure>
<p>Lucky Block has created a simple-to-use platform that allows anyone to enter a competition by purchasing an NFT from Launchpad.xyz. Each prize draw is linked to a specific NFT, with the price and available quantity of each proportional to the potential jackpot. Some of the most exciting prizes include $1 million in Bitcoin, a house, and a luxury vehicle.</p>
<p>Even after a competition has been concluded, Lucky Block NFT still provides its owner with the ability to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-earn-free-crypto.htm">earn free crypto</a> rewards every single day. This is a huge bonus and ensures that the collection remains valuable for the long term rather than being solely used to enter the prize draws.</p>
<p>In addition to the platform&#8217;s paid competitions, Lucky Block also gives back to its fans by hosting free crypto giveaways. The last giveaway hosted by Lucky Block had a grand prize of $2,500 and less than 2,500 entries, meaning participants had a far higher chance of winning compared to other giveaways.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224031/lblock-prizes.jpg" alt="lucky block prizes" /></figure>
<p>Lucky Block is in an interesting spot. Anticipation has been building surrounding the launch of the LBLOCK burn program (September 30th, 2022) and with the V1 to V2 token bridge that launched soon after (October 3rd, 2022), the price of LBLOCK could skyrocket. We&#8217;ve got a great <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lucky-block-price-prediction.htm">Lucky Block price prediction</a> article for investors interested in LBLOCK.<br />

<h3>7. Binance &#8211; Leading Exchange Hosting a Giveaway for Binance Card Users</h3>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest centralized exchange (by volume), <a href="https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=49241604">Binance </a>has a penchant for hosting some of the best crypto giveaways out there. Almost every few days, it seems that Binance has launched another competition, ranging in style from crypto airdrops to online lottery-style competitions. With Binance hosting crypto giveaways so frequently, it&#8217;s worth keeping an eye on its socials.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224033/binance-card-giveaway.jpg" alt="binance card giveaway" /></figure>
<p>We mentioned, Binance tends to host frequent free crypto giveaways. The exchange is currently rewarding users that order a Binance card with a 5 BUSD voucher. Even existing card holders can win a small kickback for transacting using the card. Furthermore, one lucky entrant will win a voucher for an entire Bitcoin, making the competition potentially rather lucrative.</p>
<p>With Binance being a favorite trading platform among crypto enthusiasts, there&#8217;s no real downside to joining in on the giveaways hosted by the exchange as many investors already have an account with the platform.<br />
<div class="cta-content-button"><a href="https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=49241604" rel="nofollow noindex noopener sponsored" >Visit Binance</a></div>
<h3>8. KuCoin &#8211; Win Crypto by Creating KuCoin-Related Memes</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=rJTJSBJ">KuCoin </a>is another popular exchange that frequently rewards its users by hosting exclusive competitions with various prizes. The exchange has a huge user base consisting of more than 10 million investors and traders around the globe. As such, to ensure that each competition is fair, KuCoin will often host region-specific competitions reducing the difficulty of winning.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224035/kucoin-giveawy.jpg" alt="kucoin giveaway" /></figure>
<p>Out of all of the platforms we&#8217;ve looked at, KuCoin hosts perhaps the greatest quantity of giveaways. Currently, there are three active competitions. One rewards people for staking crypto on the exchange, another rewards users for trying futures trading, and the final KuCoin prize draw allows people to earn crypto by creating memes related to the exchange.</p>
<p>While the competitions KuCoin hosts tend to have more specific entry requirements than most, the platform more than makes up for this with the sheer quantity of prize draws it hosts. New competitions are typically announced on the news section of KuCoin or on the company&#8217;s socials so it&#8217;s worth keeping up to date with more.<br />

<h3>9. Crypto.com &#8211; $10,000 Ethereum Giveaway for Anyone Trading ETH</h3>
<p>In addition to being home to some of the best play-to-earn games on the market, <a href="https://gridglass43.co/box_22bd1e49e2a1930b89b533f5491fade3">Crypto.com</a> also hosts some of the best crypto giveaways in the industry. The exchange, which provides hundreds of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> is well known for rewarding its users through a variety of means, most commonly, staking and cashback rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89129/224036/crypto-com-giveawy.jpg" alt="crypto.com competition" /></figure>
<p>The most recent prize draw hosted by Crypto.com is related to the highly anticipated Ethereum merge. in order to support the upgrade of Ethereum, Crypto.com launched a trading competition with a sizable $10,000 prize pool. With so many investors and traders already buying and selling ETH because of the merge, this competition could be fairly passive for some people.</p>
<p>Overall, Crypto.com is up there with the world&#8217;s best-known centralized exchanges, and with the platform hosting a myriad of prize draws it&#8217;s easy to see why. For investors looking to stock up on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects while having the chance to win some awesome prizes, Crypto.com is worthy of consideration.<br />

<h3>10. Coinbase &#8211; Win Crypto By Learning and Completing a Quick Quiz</h3>

<h2>How do Crypto Giveaways Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While the concept of the best crypto giveaway is simple, each competition tends to have slightly different prerequisites and potential prizes. As such, it can be a touch confusing to decipher how crypto giveaways work. Luckily, when the concept is explained clearly, it&#8217;s far easier to understand.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways a crypto giveaway works is by rewarding users for engaging with the brand on social media. It&#8217;s common for an entity in the crypto space to want to boost social engagement so these prize draws benefit both parties. There is a huge range of potential social actions that could be required but a couple of the most common include following an account or liking a post.</p>
<p>Another way it&#8217;s possible to enter the best crypto giveaway is by engaging in trading-related activities on a certain platform.

Some platforms will offer rewards for spot trading or even <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">staking coins</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, there is a multitude of different competition out there. However, they will all typically involve the entrant completing some sort of action beneficial to the host of the giveaway.

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Brand New Altcoin Introducing a Revolutionary Stake-to-Mine Model</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is a revolutionary new stake-to-mine cryptocurrency through which investors can earn cloud mining credits and mining power on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>For those looking to engage in mining activities without the high entry barrier, Bitcoin Minetrix offers a simple solution. The platform also offers a &#8216;minedrop&#8217; with rewards of $30k for early supporters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-133412" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" width="900" height="437" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 1319w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x497.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x373.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700472971-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix will tokenize cloud mining by leveraging the $BTCMTX token. All one has to do is purchase $BTCMTX on the presale and stake their holdings. Bitcoin Minetrix has a 4 billion token supply, and has allocated 2.8 billion tokens across 39 presale rounds.</p>
<p>Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0119 per token &#8211; this price will rise with each successive stage.</p>
<p>The current staking APY (Annual Percentage Yield) on $BTCMTX is 130%, which will eventually reduce as more tokens are staked on the Ethereum-powered smart contract. Staked token holders will earn passive income in the form of cloud mining credits.</p>
<p>While these credits cannot be traded, investors can burn them on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin cloud mining power. This allows one to get allocated mining time and a share of mining revenues. This is a cost-efficient solution to other cloud mining services due to the high costs of operations and the prevalent third-party scams.</p>

<p>By tokenizing the tokens, investors can join a decentralized platform that is secure to use. The presale requires investors to make just a $10 investment to get started &#8211; over $4.5 million has been raised in eight weeks since it launched.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-133431" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale.png" alt="TG.Casino presale" width="900" height="488" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale.png 1240w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale-300x163.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale-1024x555.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474561-tg-casino-presale-768x416.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

Furthermore, the token will also be rewarded to players within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>$TGC can also be staked to earn APYs as high as 185%. From a 100 million token supply, the TG.Casino presale has allocated 40 million tokens. Users can also benefit from TG.Casino’s buyback and burn mechanism, with the casino using a portion of its profits to buy back $TGC tokens.</p>
<p>From the purchased tokens, 60% will be sent to holders as part of a profit share, while 40% of these tokens will be burnt, making the supply deflationary.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/331152/tg-token-tokenomics.jpg" alt="TG.Casino tokenomics" /></figure>

<h3><b>6. Sponge &#8211; New Meme Coin Offering High Staking Yields, Up By 220% in the Past Week</b></h3>
<p>One of the best new altcoins to hold for explosive returns is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/spongebob-site/en">Sponge</a> ($SPONGE). This new meme cryptocurrency has been trending recently &#8211; after its massive price explosion following the launch of its staking pool.</p>
<p>After releasing in May 2023, $SPONGE reached an all-time high of $0.002 per token. After dropping below the $0.0002 mark, Sponge has regained momentum in the past few weeks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131494" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034606-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-53-46-am.png" alt="Sponge price" width="900" height="456" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034606-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-53-46-am.png 1106w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034606-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-53-46-am-300x152.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034606-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-53-46-am-1024x518.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034606-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-53-46-am-768x389.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>At the time of writing, $SPONGE is trading at a price of $0.00035 per token. In the last 7 days, this new cryptocurrency is up by more than 210% and it is over 300% in a month.</p>
<p>The price growth can be attributed to the staking features that the token offers. Through the staking mechanism, investors can lock in their holdings and earn annual yields as high as 210%. So far, almost 400 million tokens have been locked on the staking contract.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131780 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700059790-sponge-token-staking.png" alt="" width="1879" height="490" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700059790-sponge-token-staking.png 1879w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700059790-sponge-token-staking-300x78.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700059790-sponge-token-staking-1024x267.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700059790-sponge-token-staking-768x200.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1700059790-sponge-token-staking-1536x401.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1879px) 100vw, 1879px" /></p>
<p>The more one stakes on the ecosystem, the higher the rewards. So far, over $100k worth of tokens have been locked on Sponge. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/spongebob/en">DEXTools</a> states that $SPONGE has a market cap of more than $9 million. With the new staking feature, Sponge can potentially keep soaring in valuation in the long term.</p>

<h3><b>7. ETHETF Token &#8211; New ERC-20 Token Celebrates the Arrival of an Ethereum Spot ETF</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://ethetftoken.io/">ETHETF Token</a> ($ETHETF) is a revolutionary project &#8211; since it is the first to design its tokenomics based on the Ethereum Spot ETF’s approval.</p>
<p>BlackRock, one of the major asset managers in the world, filed for an Ethereum Spot ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund), with the SEC. An Ethereum ETF would allow investors to trade Ethereum like another share in the stock exchange &#8211; making it an esteemed financial asset.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131479" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700032450-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-42-57-am.png" alt="ETHETF Token home" width="900" height="379" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700032450-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-42-57-am.png 1296w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700032450-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-42-57-am-300x126.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700032450-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-42-57-am-1024x431.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700032450-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-11-42-57-am-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>ETHETF Token wants to celebrate this arrival by rewarding $ETHETF token holders through its platform. Firstly, $ETHETF is an ERC-20 token, meaning that the coin is linked to the fortunes of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ETHETF Token will charge a 2% buy-burn tax on all transactions. Thus, as the supply reduces, the value of the remaining tokens increases. However, once the SEC approves the Ethereum Spot ETF &#8211; ETHETF Token will eradicate the burn tax as a celebratory gesture.</p>
<p>The goal of ETHETF Token is to offer a cryptocurrency that lets investors capitalize on the Ethereum ETF, even before its approval. $ETHETF has a 100 million token supply &#8211; 95% of which is being used for DEX liquidity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131497" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034720-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-12-50-18-pm.png" alt="ETHETF Token price" width="900" height="591" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034720-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-12-50-18-pm.png 978w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034720-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-12-50-18-pm-300x197.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700034720-screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-12-50-18-pm-768x504.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Currently, interested investors can buy $ETHETF on Uniswap for just $0.0087 per token. The token is up by more than 75% in the last 24 hours.

<h3><strong>8. eTukTuk &#8211; Reduce Carbon Emissions in the Developing World</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/"><u>eTukTuk</u></a>, a new eco-friendly initiative based on the BSC blockchain, prepares for launch in Sri Lanka with a twofold mission &#8211; environmental protection and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>This project aims to replace traditional fossil fuel-reliant TukTuks with their electric counterparts, mitigating carbon emissions while offering economic advantages. The presale has already raised more than $275k with buyers able to earn 750% staking APY.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315137/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk EV crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Electric TukTuks bring significant cost reductions in operation and maintenance, potentially boosting driver income by an impressive 400%. Sri Lanka, home to a vast fleet of millions of TukTuks, can provide a solid base for eTukTuk’s journey to kick off.</p>
<p>With the strong backing of The Capital Maharaja Group, a significant conglomerate in Sri Lanka, eTukTuk&#8217;s goal of affordable and accessible electric vehicles and charging stations have become more feasible.</p>
<p>Incorporating blockchain tech, eTukTuk promotes financial inclusion by assigning digital identities, narrowing the economic divide. As per the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf?"><u>eTukTuk whitepaper</u></a>, It doubles as a socio-economic tool, aiming to make a mark beyond transportation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315136/etuktuk-staking.jpg" alt="eTukTuk power staking mechanics" /></figure>
<p>Token holders can support charging station operations by staking their tokens, earning annual yields in return. This unique staking method sets eTukTuk apart, further showing its innovative approach.</p>
<p>eTukTuk seeks to create a future where transportation and economic growth harmoniously coexist without affecting the planet&#8217;s health. You can join the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>eTukTuk Telegram group</u></a> for the latest information.<br />

<h3><strong>9. Chimpzee &#8211; Crypto Token Helping Save Wildlife and Environment  </strong></h3>
<p>Although many cryptocurrency projects are developing innovative financial solutions, there is a scarcity of functional environmental and social solutions. However, a new trend is emerging, with a handful of pioneering initiatives leading the way.</p>
<p><a href="/ext/chimpzee/"><u>Chimpzee</u></a> is one of these projects, with a primary focus on safeguarding the planet and its wildlife. Chimpzee provides various features that enable users to generate passive income while simultaneously contributing to environmental causes and has raised more than $2.3 million since the presale launched.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/275719/image1.jpg" alt="Chimpzee crypto project" /></figure>
<p>These features, including Play-to-Earn, Shop-to-Earn, and Trade-to-Earn, can be accessed via the Chimpzee shop, NFT marketplace, and Zero Tolerance Game. The team has dedicated 10% of the token supply and a share of the profits to support organizations committed to these causes.</p>
<p>Earning passive income in the most profitable manner is achievable by possessing a Chimpzee NFT passport, which allows users to obtain extra CHMPZ tokens, rewards and advantages by interacting with different components of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>To participate in the Chimpzee presale and acquire these exclusive passports when they become available after, investors can buy $CHMPZ for $0.00155 per token.</p>
<p>Receiving an opportunity to mint the Chimpzee Diamond NFT passport after the presale offers users the most significant rewards, with the highest earning potential as the supply is limited.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-133439" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474800-chimpzee-presale.png" alt="Chimpzee presale" width="900" height="394" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474800-chimpzee-presale.png 1383w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474800-chimpzee-presale-300x131.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474800-chimpzee-presale-1024x448.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700474800-chimpzee-presale-768x336.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Those who miss out on the presale must pay a higher price for the passports and wait until after the whitelist NFT passport prelaunch, which is exclusively available to presale investors.</p>
<p>Only participants in the first round will have access to mint the Diamond NFT passport in the exclusive pre-launch whitelist event. Chimpzee has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field of environmental projects and is definitely worth monitoring. Availing the opportunity to participate in the presale early on comes with irresistible benefits.<br />

<h3><strong>10. Scorpion Token (SCORP) &#8211; Earn Up To $10,000 in Daily Passive Staking</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a> is the future leading eGambling platform that lets users earn up to $10,000 USDT in daily passive staking, depending on the casino’s performance. The project is on a mission to build the number-one online social gambling platform that seeks to provide a fun and seamless gambling experience while simultaneously allowing everybody to earn.</p>
<p>Licensed and regulated by the Curacao EGaming licensing entity, Scorpion Casino can boast over 210 casino games, with an additional 160 live games. The platform hosts all the popular games you would expect from a major casino, including blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots. In addition, the games are highly polished as the casino is connected with all the major gaming providers, including Evolution, NetEnt, EGT, and AMATIC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/276950/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="scorpion casino presale" /></figure>
<p>In addition to the traditional table games, Scorpion Casino also hosts a sports betting section, allowing users to bet on the outcome of their favorite sports games. The sports section has all the major leagues integrated for popular sports such as soccer, tennis, golf, basketball, horse racing, boxing, and MMA.</p>
<p>The passive staking earnings are provided through a redistribution tax that’s baked into the smart contract for the token. A 2% tax is leveraged on all transactions, which is re-distributed to all SCORP holders. As a result, holders will see their token balance increase when holding the token as the casino gains more adoption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the token is actually deflationary due to the 1% burn tax that is levied on each transaction. Over time, the total supply for SCORP will continue to decrease, making the remaining tokens more scarce and valuable.</p>
<p>The project is currently hosting a presale for its native token, SCORP. The native token will be the exclusive payment method for the entire ecosystem and will be the default betting currency across the casino and sports gaming products. However, the casino also accepts major cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, and BNB.</p>
<p>Investors who purchase more than $1,000 SCORP in the presale are automatically enrolled in the Elite Scorpion Members Club, which provides multiple benefits, including;</p>
<ul>
<li>A VIP service</li>
<li>Cashback on the casino</li>
<li>Extra staking rewards</li>
<li>Addition SCORP tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, those that use the exclusive bonus code Scorpion20 when making their purchase can get an extra 20% tokens on their investment &#8211; $2 million has now been raised in the presale.</p>
<p>The project has announced that it has already secured a top-tier centralized exchange listing for when the presale ends, which will be announced close to the conclusion of the presale.<br />

<h3><strong>12. yPredict &#8211; Crypto Analytics Platform offering Multiple Income Earning Opportunities</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> is a cryptocurrency analytics platform that offers predictive analytics and models on various digital assets.</p>
<p>By holding $YPRED, the native cryptocurrency of the ecosystem, one can earn passive income through different income streams.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/272467/ypredict-home.jpg" alt="yPredict AI-Driven Analytics" /></figure>
<p>The $YPRED altcoin can be used to purchase subscriptions to predictive models on yPredict’s financial marketplace. Financial data scientists offer these models, sharing their future outlooks on the marketplace. Notably, the models are only introduced after being properly reviewed by the yPredict decentralized autonomous organization.</p>
<p>yPredict uses multiple features through which they offer data-driven insights on the crypto markets. One of which is AI-driven tools such as Natural Language Processing. In this tool, AI is used to study the buying sentiment and behavior of certain tokens.</p>
<p>yPredict also uses AI trading signals and multiple chart patterns to determine the trajectory of different cryptocurrency tokens. While there is no guarantee that new tokens such as $YPRED will offer huge returns, the token can be staked to generate rewards within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>For instance, staked token holders receive 15% of all the swapping fees on the ecosystem. Furthermore, 10% of all revenues generated from the platform subscriptions are distributed to token holders.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311548/ypredict-rivals.jpg" alt="yPredict key features" /></figure>
<p>Since there is also a tax on buying and selling the token, there is a possibility of lower volatility. A 7% selling tax will be implemented on $YPRED, out of which the fees will be used for marketing, development, and liquidity purposes.</p>
<p>$YPRED has a total supply of only 100 billion tokens. As the platform staking increases, the reduced supply can play a role in determining the future price. Currently, the token is priced at $0.11 during the ongoing presale. The price will jump 9% to $0.12 upon listing.</p>
<p>yPredict has now raised more than $5 million since the presale started. Read the <a href="https://docs.ypredict.ai/">yPredict whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/ypredict">Telegram group</a> to stay informed about this project.<br />

<h3><strong>13. Sensei Inu &#8211; Trivia-Based Altcoin With Proof Of Value Consensus Mechanism &amp; 50 Million Airdrop</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/senseiinu/"><u>Sensei Inu ($SINU)</u></a> is a new type of altcoin that provides a proof of value consensus mechanism as opposed to the commonly used proof of stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>It is a trivia-based platform where users are rewarded for their knowledge and experience as opposed to holding and staking their coins &#8211; more than $550k has been raised in the presale so far.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/334438/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei Inu crypto presale" /></figure>
<p>In this way, the project aims to remedy financial inequality. It’s easily possible for rich individuals and institutions to purchase a load of PoS tokens and reap the rewards without doing any work or contributing much value. But with Sensei Inu, rewards accrue depending on how much the student has learned.</p>
<p>There are trivia competitions with more rewards for the winners. The questions get progressively harder towards the end of each round. A user-friendly dashboard allows users to manage all of their operations including their targets and total rewards, as well as areas of improvement.</p>
<p>There are a total of 5 billion $SINU tokens with 2.5 billion available in the presale at a price of just $0.0007, though this will rise to $0.0008 in the next stage. This is a strong investment incentive, as the coin is likely to increase further as the presale continues.</p>
<p>There is also a 50 million token airdrop set to take place soon.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/334439/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei proof-of-value mechanism" /></figure>
<p>With this new proof of value platform, the more that users play and learn, the more they get rewarded, as it is more connected to real-world value. A governance DAO also allows users to vote on important decisions within the wider ecosystem. The trivia questions are mainly related to Web3.</p>
<p>More information on this new proof of value ecosystem can be found on the <a href="https://media.senseiinu.com/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Sensei Inu Whitepaper</u></a> as well as the <a href="https://t.me/SenseiOfficialTG"><u>Telegram</u></a> account.<br />

<h3><strong>14. Ethereum &#8211; Largest Altcoin and Originator of Smart Contracts</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) is the king of altcoins. It&#8217;s the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, beaten only by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ethereum fathered the ERC standard used by many of today&#8217;s best altcoins to watch. But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">is Ethereum a good investment</a> right now?</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311549/ethereum-foundation.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Many investors consider Ethereum to be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy now</a> and for good reason. The project has consistently proven itself able to weather any bear market while still providing the same great service to its users.</p>
<p>A large portion of the most popular altcoins utilize the ERC standard and with the upcoming Ethereum update expected to improve throughput, this is unlikely to change anytime soon. It&#8217;s also considered to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-vr-crypto.htm">best VR cryptos</a> as it powers many of the new projects on the market.</p>
<p>With the amount of value the project offers, Ethereum is one of the best altcoins to buy and a worthy addition to any well-diversified portfolio.<br />
<div class="cta-content-button"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" rel="nofollow noindex noopener sponsored" >Visit ETH on eToro</a></div>
<h3><strong>15. Chainlink &#8211; Popular Project Bringing Off-chain Data On-Chain</strong></h3>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is packed full of intrinsic value and is one of the most popular altcoins currently available.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s core value proposition is the ability to implement off-chain data sources into on-chain applications, something that has drastically increased the functionality of Web3 projects as well as other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311550/chainlink.jpg" alt="Chainlink web3 services platform" /></figure>
<p>Few of even the best altcoins to watch can compete with Chainlink in terms of industry partnerships. Due to the nature of the project, it&#8217;s in the interest of other cryptocurrencies to join Chainlink in order to improve their own offerings. This has resulted in Chainlink&#8217;s technology being incorporated in a range of high-profile projects like Aave.</p>
<p>Overall, Chainlink is one of the best altcoins to buy right now. Even during the current market downturn, it has remained strong and as it uses the ERC standard, the upcoming Ethereum merge will likely award LINK a slight boost in value.<br />

<h3><strong>16. XRP &#8211; Transactional Cryptocurrency Touted as being the Future of Currency Exchanges</strong></h3>
<p>XRP is a transactional cryptocurrency that many investors believe could be the future of banking. The token was created by David Shwartz as a more cost and energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin with Ripple Labs being created soon thereafter in order to create use cases for XRP.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311551/xrp-1505.jpg" alt="XRP offering utility for global economy" /></figure>
<p>While Ripple and XRP are currently in the midst of a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the unlicensed selling of securities, many speculate that XRP could explode following the suit&#8217;s conclusion. Like Chainlink, XRP has a huge number of partnerships with financial institutions and banks including the Bank of America, MoneyGram, and American Express.</p>
<p>Being launched in 2012, XRP cannot be counted alongside new altcoins but it remains one of the best altcoins to buy. With its partial win over the SEC in a long standing court trial, it can also be regarded as born anew.</p>
<p>The price certainly reflects this, trading at $0.71 at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/xrp-surges-after-judge-delivers-a-huge-win-to-ripple-in-its-case-against-the-sec.html">rising sharply after the SEC court victory.</a><br />

<h3><strong>17. BNB &#8211; Cryptocurrency Powering the Binance Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>BNB sometimes referred to as Build and Build, is the propriety token of the world&#8217;s largest exchange (by volume), Binance.</p>
<p>Despite originally launching as a rather basic blockchain designed primarily to reduce fees on the Binance exchange, BNB has since expanded into the smart contract sector and is commonly used to power new altcoins like Battle Infinity.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/311552/bnb-coin.jpg" alt="Binance trading fees" /></figure>
<p>The value of BNB absolutely exploded in early 2021 as investors everywhere were looking for the next project to rival Ethereum and with the BEP standard based on ERC, it was a clear contender. The release of the Binance Smart Chain also created immense demand for BNB as it&#8217;s used to fuel all transactions on the network. The majority of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-price-prediction.htm">BNB price predictions</a> suggest that this utility token could reach an ATH of $2,000 by the end of 2030.</p>
<p>All in all, BNB is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best crypto to buy Reddit</a> and still offers massive upside potential. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem is only growing as a result of its low costs and similarities with the ERC standard, making it one of the top new altcoins to invest in this year.<br />

<h2><strong>What is an Altcoin?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><strong>Altcoins are made up of a brought spectrum of projects and are not limited by category, consensus mechanism, or intended use. </strong></i></p></blockquote>
<p>Altcoin simply means alternative coin. As such, any alternative (to Bitcoin) can be considered an altcoin. In practice, this means that every cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin is classed as an altcoin.</p>
<h2><strong>Can Altcoins Make for a Good Investment?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With Altcoins being made up of such a large variety of projects, some will make for good investments while others will slowly fade into obscurity. Below, we&#8217;ve shared a few reasons why altcoins can make an excellent addition to a well-balanced portfolio.</p>
<h3><strong>Technology</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p><i><strong>One of the most interesting aspects of altcoins is the technology they possess. With cryptocurrency already being an emerging technology, altcoins can provide access to subsectors like decentralized finance, the Metaverse, and P2E gaming. </strong></i></p></blockquote>
<p>The best altcoins to buy will typically feature new and exciting features, making them an excellent way to get to the forefront of technology.</p>
<p>Among those listed here, Launchpad XYZ wants to create a gateway for mass adoption to Web3 while yPredict is utilizing artificial intelligence to help crypto traders and investors. XRP20 uses staking technology to enhance a regular &#8220;dumb&#8221; token into something that rewards users.</p>
<p>All these projects utilize blockchain technology in different ways to provide utility and a solution to a real-world issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Diversification</strong></h3>
<p>As we mentioned, there is a massive variety of different altcoins available and as such, they can make for an excellent diversification tool. With altcoins spanning every sector within cryptocurrency, regardless of how a portfolio is composed, there will be an altcoin able to reduce an investor&#8217;s exposure to a specific sector, effectively reducing risk.</p>
<h3><strong>Room for Growth</strong></h3>
<p>While Bitcoin is regarded as being a safer, blue-chip crypto, its larger size means it&#8217;s more difficult for the price to move substantially in either direction. However, altcoins will have lower market caps, meaning that less demand is required for them to be pushed upward or downward.</p>
<p>Meme coins can often show explosive growth, but investors have to be careful about which projects they choose. Not only do some meme coins have a very short shelf life, but many are also outright scams.</p>
<p>As such, altcoins can make for excellent growth vehicles, provided the proper due diligence is done prior to investing.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Altcoins to Buy</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With there being so many different altcoins on the market, an investor needs to narrow down their search criteria to find worthwhile projects. Sometimes you need more than just the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">best crypto signals</a> to know which crypto project is worth investing in. We&#8217;ll be sharing a few quick tips to help find the best altcoins to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Whitepaper &#8211; </strong>One of the most effective techniques to weed out lackluster projects is thoroughly reviewing a project&#8217;s whitepaper. The best altcoins to buy will always feature a well-written whitepaper that clearly explains exactly what the project does as well well as its plans for the future. If a cryptocurrency makes a lot of promises without explaining how they will be achieved, it&#8217;s best avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media &#8211; </strong>Taking a look at social media can be a great way to determine how investors feel about a project and whether it has a strong community. While stats like followers can be easily purchased online, it&#8217;s much harder to fake an active community consistently commenting and sharing so these are both factors to look out for when trying to find the best altcoins for 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Utility &#8211; </strong>While it&#8217;s possible for some projects to perform well and offer great returns through hype alone, it&#8217;ll never be conducive to long-term growth. Instead, it&#8217;s better to look out for utility-focused projects that provide a useful service or product. These altcoins will always have a demand regardless of hype or the market, making them far safer long-term investments.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Buy the Best Altcoin &#8211; Bitcoin ETF Token</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure that no investor is left unable to buy the best altcoin, we&#8217;ve detailed exactly how to buy $BTCETF tokens below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Crypto Wallet &#8211; </strong>Before accessing the $BTCETF presale, investors can download a cryptocurrency wallet such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect.</li>
<li><strong>Buy ETH or USDT &#8211; </strong>An ERC-20 token, $BTCETF, can be swapped with similar assets such as ETH or USDT. Purchase Ethereum or USDT from a suitable crypto exchange and transfer the assets to the crypto wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Connect Wallet and Buy $BTCETF &#8211; </strong>Visit the Bitcoin ETF Token website and click on ‘Connect Wallet’. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Afterwards, one can choose to buy $BTCETF with the available crypto options. Enter the amount to swap and confirm the purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Claim Tokens &#8211; </strong>Investors can claim the $BTCETF tokens after the presale ends. To do so, visit the presale website.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Where to Buy Other Altcoins</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Meme Kombat is the best new altcoin and an excellent all-around project, some investors will want to purchase another token from our list. To do this, they will require a top-of-the-line broker.</p>
<h3><strong>eToro &#8211; Buy the Top Altcoins with just 1% Commission</strong></h3>
<p>eToro was founded in 2007 and has since grown to become a leading broker for cryptocurrency and stocks thanks to its fantastic feature set. The broker is regulated by leading tier-1 bodies including the FCA, ASIC, and CySEC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/219146/etoro-crypto-site.jpg" alt="etoro crypto selection" /></figure>
<p>With security always a large area of concern for crypto investors, it&#8217;s crucial for a broker to protect its clients. eToro secures personal details before they&#8217;re sent to the server by using SSL encryption but that&#8217;s not all. The majority of client funds are stored offline and untouchable in cold storage, preventing the risk of clients losing funds due to eToro getting compromised.</p>
<p>While eToro is great for those employing a buy-and-hold strategy, it&#8217;s also a great broker for traders. It provides its users with a range of charting tools, useful when it comes to determining key price points and figuring out when to enter a trade. Furthermore, eToro allows users to set both limit and market orders, allowing users to fine-tune their entry points.</p>
<p>In addition to investing and manually trading, eToro supports social trading. This allows users to choose a trader they like and automatically mirror their trades, excellent for beginners trying to earn a profit or learn strategy.</p>
<p>Overall, eToro is an excellent platform for both beginners and more experienced investors. It offers a wide range of tools and through its various platforms, a great deal of customizability. As such, eToro is the number one broker for investors looking to stock up on altcoins.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong><u>Buy Crypto on eToro</u></strong></a></p>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We&#8217;ve taken a look at some of the best altcoins to buy, discussed the benefits of altcoins, and explained how to choose the find altcoins with the highest potential. However, throughout our research, we determined that one particular project boasts the most potential.</p>
<p>One of the top altcoins right now is $BTCETF, the native cryptocurrency of Bitcoin ETF Token. This new altcoin speculates on the arrival of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF. $BTCETF will burn 25% of its token supply upon the achievement of five predetermined milestones.</p>
<p>Token holders can stake the $BTCETF token to earn huge staking yields, which currently sit at 180%. $BTCETF can be purchased through the ongoing presale, which has raised more than $2 million in just three weeks.<br />

<p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com. </i></p>
<p>As one of the first projects to get involved with the mobile crypto mining craze, many investors are looking for a Pi coin price prediction to see whether the token is worth mining. </p>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ll be taking a comprehensive look at the current price of Pi coin, the Pi coin future price, and discussing whether Pi is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now. Let&#8217;s get started. </p>
<h2>Pi Coin Price Prediction Summary </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>For investors simply looking for a brief rundown of the potential price of Pi Coin, we&#8217;ve summarized each year below. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023 &#8211;</strong> The mainnet release did go smoothly, which resulted in Pi peaking at above the $292 mark before retracing. Experts predict that the Pi coin will be worth $35 by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025 &#8211; </strong>Should the Pi network ecosystem continue to expand, the token could be worth around $50 by 2025. </li>
<li><strong>End of 2030 &#8211; </strong>Moving onward to the end of the decade, if the Pi network can keep on growing and get a lot of applications created on the network, the token could climb as high as $100. </li>
</ul>
<h2>History of the Price of Pi Coin</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When it comes to looking at how Pi Coin has performed historically, the waters can get a little muddied. As the network&#8217;s mainnet still remains yet to be launched, there&#8217;s previous price data to go on. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll be shooting blind. There&#8217;s still plenty of information we can gather from how the project has been operating over the past year. </p>
<p>Firstly, as Pi Coin operates a bit differently from traditional crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it&#8217;s worth taking a second to understand how Pi Coin works. The idea of the Pi Network was to allow people to mine crypto directly from a smartphone. With Pi gaining over 30 million users at its peak, this concept was clearly a smash hit. </p>
<p>Rather than joining the ranks of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-upcoming-icos.htm">best upcoming ICOs</a>, Pi Coin has instead opted to allow users to mine coins on the testnet which will then be transferred across to the mainnet once it launches. By taking this approach, the Pi Coin team has managed to create a strong and loyal community that has a vested interest in the success of the project. </p>
<p>In order to provide its earliest supporters with the best value, the Pi Team choose to incrementally half the mining rewards for users as certain milestones were achieved. This initially took place when Pi Coin surpassed 100,000 users, then again, at 1 million, once more at 10 million users joined the network, and there will  be a final halving at the 100 million user milestone.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88980/223678/pi-mainnet-checklist.jpg" alt="pi network mainnet checklist" /></figure>
<p>In contrast to assets like Bitcoin which feature a fixed supply, the Pi network uses a system that allocates coins based on user count. So for each user (up to 100 million users), a number of coins are pre-minted that can then be mined by the user over their lifecycle.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88980/316622/pi-coin-price-history.jpg" alt="Pi to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Shortly after Pi ended up on cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Huuobi, BitMart, HotCoin Global, Biconomy, SupeEX, and XT.com, it hit the ground running. Fuelled by the recent interest in Bitcoin as well as its own merit, Pi rose up in value and peaked went from $30 to $292 within a short time. It was due to the massive anticipation that was building up for this token for the past 2 years. </p>
<p>January 2023 saw the token going through a massive drop to $44 before bouncing to $88, followed by finding an accumulation range around the $48 range. The token continued to correct through Q1-2023, and at the time of writing, it is hovering around the $22 mark.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pi Coin Launched in 2019</li>
<li>Pi currently lacks a value and won&#8217;t until the mainnet is launched</li>
<li>The Pi Network hit 100,000 users in June 2019</li>
<li>The Pi Network hit 1 million users in April 2020</li>
<li>By December 2021 Pi had over 30 million users</li>
<li>Several exchanges launch Pi &#8216;IOUs&#8217; in December 2022, sending price soaring</li>
<li>Pi Network confirms it is NOT affiliated with any exchange listings yet</li>
<li>Mainnet launched in early 2023</li>
<li>Initial interest in Pi was high, leading to the Pi price going up to $292 before retrace. </li>
<li>The retrace has been gradual throughout the first quarter of 2023. At the time of writing, Pi Coin has been trading around the $22 mark. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Pi Coin Background</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With almost 40 million people owning a Pi wallet and actively mining, a huge buzz was generated during the launch. That led to many people accumulating tokens to sell once it reaches its peak, and then happened when the token hit hte $292 mark. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88980/223679/35-million-pi-users.jpg" alt="35 million pioneers of the Pi Network" /></figure>
<p>With the value of cryptocurrency largely driven by supply and demand, these two parties will essentially battle it out upon the release of the coin. If there is more buying pressure, we could see a huge rally. Conversely, if the selling pressure is higher, the price of Pi could suffer until those planning to sell as soon as possible are shaken out of the market. </p>
<p>To get an idea of how the coin might perform it&#8217;s worth taking a look at the <a href="https://minepi.com/white-paper.Pi#paragraph_3">Pi whitepaper</a>. It states that the total supply of Pi can be calculated by combining total mining rewards, total referral rewards, and total developer rewards. </p>
<p>The huge hype and interest around the coin was shown in the last month when a number of exchanges unofficially &#8216;listed&#8217; the coin in the form of IOUs.</p>
<p>That caused the price to see an incredibly large pump of nearly 1,500% with the inauthentic Pi coins reaching a price of more than $300 each.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pi is in Enclosed Mainnet with no external connectivity permitted. Pi Network isn’t affiliated with and hasn’t authorized any exchange listing. Such listings may not operate on real Pi. Participation may result in loss. Trust only official Pi channels: <a href="https://t.co/BZtL2zQOrj">https://t.co/BZtL2zQOrj</a></p>&mdash; Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/PiCoreTeam/status/1608527566872403969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, the Pi Network told its followers on social media that the project had not authorized any exchange listing and participation may result in a loss. The statement read: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pi is in Enclosed Mainnet with no external connectivity permitted. Pi Network isn’t affiliated with and hasn’t authorized any exchange listing. Such listings may not operate on real Pi. Participation may result in loss. Trust only official Pi channels. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The huge surge in price does show the level of interest in the token, however, but such a pump would &#8211; in live market circumstances &#8211; lead to a massive dump with early miners selling their coins at a huge profit.</p>
<h2>Pi Coin Price Prediction 2023</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The goal of the Pi network is to create a decentralized cryptocurrency smart contracts network allowing people to create applications within the Pi network, with Pi miners acting as validators.</p>
<p>Since the Pi token has currently been trading inside the accumulation range, it can be said that the selling pressure has subsided. While there is no clear detail about when the Pi Mainnet will be launched, articles say that developers are hard at work working out the final kinks of the <a href="https://www.btcc.com/en-US/academy/research-analysis/pi-network-mainnet-when-is-pi-coin-launching">open mainnet</a>. It means that we may see the developments of dApps on the mainnet, which would then dictate PI&#8217;s price movements in 2023. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88980/316622/pi-coin-price-history.jpg" alt="Pi to USD price chart" /><br />Furthermore, the number of users within the network will continue to increase, in turn, boosting the supply. Estimating a 20% rate of growth in order to account for the hype generated by the mainnet launch and use cases slowly being unveiled, that would place the total number of Pi users at approximately 43.5 million with the total token supply at 300 billion. </p>
<p>With Ethereum being regarded as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a>, we&#8217;ll refer to its historical growth once again. By October 2018, the project had around 44 million unique wallets and a market cap of around $25 billion following a few months of downturn. </p>
<p>Pi launched with a lot of fanfare on the cryptocurrency exchanges and peaked at $292 before retracing. While the token is trading at $22 at press time, it could go up to $35 by the end of this year. </p>
<h2>Pi Coin Price Prediction 2025 </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Moving on to 2025, we can expect to see a larger number of developers get involved with the Pi ecosystem as a result of its heavy decentralization, low-cost transactions, and energy-efficient nature. Depending on the crypto landscape at the time, this could lead to a large jump in our Pi coin price prediction. </p>
<p>Assuming a 15% yearly increase in the number of Pi users as hype from the mainnet launch dies down but the number of applications on the networks increases, we could see around 57.5 million people using the Pi network with a total token supply of around 395 billion. </p>
<p>With these figures, a low-end Pi coin price prediction of $50 and at its peak, we are predicting that it will cross the $300 mark. </p>
<h3>Pi Coin Price Prediction 2030</h3>
<p>Jumping further into the future, by 2030 we&#8217;ll likely see all the allotted number of Pi tokens in circulation hit its cap as the project&#8217;s goal of 100 million users will likely be hit. As it stands today, the team has not revealed whether mining rewards will be eliminated in favor of another consensus mechanism or if another reward halving will occur. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/cryptocurrency-market-100149">Some analysts</a> expect to see the global cryptocurrency increase annually by a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11.1%. If the Pi network is managed correctly, it makes sense that the Pi cryptocurrency value would grow at a similar rate. Therefore, our Pi coin price prediction places the asset at a low of around $0.25 and a high of around $0.70. </p>
<p>Predicting the price movements of cryptocurrencies is far from an accurate science but with many analysts using technical indicators to forecast the future of these digital assets some crypto traders have also been looking for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a>. Considering that BTC is the largest cryptocurrency on the market, it&#8217;s health and price trajectory usually has a major influence on other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">popular altcoins</a>. </p>
<h2>Pi Coin Price Potential Highs &amp; Lows</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<h2>Where to Buy Crypto Coins</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although Pi might not be available to purchase yet, due to Pi&#8217;s high user count, it makes sense that the asset will be listed on some of the world&#8217;s top exchanges. Regulated broker Binance is often at the forefront of the crypto industry when it comes to adding exciting new projects, so we could expect to see it listed on the platform sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>Pi Coin &#8216;IOUs&#8217; are listed on several exchanges, including Huobi and XT.com &#8211; however, the Pi Network confirmed to its social media followers that these are not authorized and should not be purchased.</p>
<h3>Binance &#8211; World&#8217;s Biggest Exchange With Huge Product Suite</h3>
<p>Binance was founded in 2017 by Chengpeng Zhou and has since grown to be the biggest and most well-known crypto exchange in the world. It has launched two of its own cryptos, BUSD and BNB, and has a gigantic suite of products for customers.</p>
<p>This includes a dedicated NFT marketplace, loans, staking APY, educational facilities, futures, spot, P2P, mining pools, trading bots, launchpads, and more. Pi is currently listed on the Binance exchange and retails at $34. Its 24-hour trading volume is $280,000. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136766" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1701094230-screen-shot-2023-11-27-at-14-09-50.png" alt="Pi Token On Binance" width="900" height="383" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1701094230-screen-shot-2023-11-27-at-14-09-50.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1701094230-screen-shot-2023-11-27-at-14-09-50-300x128.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1701094230-screen-shot-2023-11-27-at-14-09-50-768x327.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Along with keeping your funds in the exchange, Binance offers a decentralized wallet application. This acts as a bridge between Web3 and the world of centralized exchanges. Tokens can be swapped cross-chain at a good price. This is a fully self custodial wallet solution. </p>
<p>Binance registration should take less than 5 minutes in terms of verifying your name and email. You will need to submit some KYC information to make larger trades.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the exchange has over 50 million monthly visits and nearly $11,000,000,000 in 24-hour trade volume. Monthly visits and 24 hour trade volume are both more than twice that of the next leading exchange &#8211; OKX. </p>
<p>There is a standard 0.1% fee for regular users, discounted by 25% for BNB purchases. There are no deposit fees. </p>

<h2>Is Pi Coin the Best Crypto to Invest in Today?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><br />While Pi Coin is an interesting project that could perform rather well, it&#8217;s not yet available to purchase, making it impossible to invest in Pi Coin today. However, we&#8217;ve done the research and found another early-stage project that has already proven to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> of the year.</p>
<h3>Wall Street Memes &#8211; Leading Memecoin of 2023 with a Massive Social Media Following</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> has emerged as an influential player in the meme coin landscape, securing almost $13 million during its presale at the time of writing. With a proven track record, the project&#8217;s team successfully launched the &#8220;Wall St Bulls&#8221; NFT collection, raising $2.5 million by selling out all 10,000 pieces in just 32 minutes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88980/316624/wall-street-memes-dubai-crash.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes memes" /></figure>
<p>What distinguishes Wall Street Memes is its thriving community of over 1 million followers across various social media platforms. Renowned for its engaging and humorous financial market content, the project aims to deepen community involvement through the $WSM token.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s unique tokenomics set it apart from its counterparts. Unlike other meme coin projects, the team has decided against reserving any $WSM tokens for themselves. Instead, they have distributed the entire token supply of two billion $WSM among the community.</p>
<p>This approach aligns the developers&#8217; incentives with $WSM holders, emphasizing the project&#8217;s commitment to community-driven success.</p>
<p>To further ignite excitement, Wall Street Memes has introduced a $50,000 airdrop as part of the presale celebration. By participating in social media-related tasks on the official Discord server, community members have a chance to win a share of the prize in $WSM tokens.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ve taken a detailed look at the Pi Coin project, provided our Pi Coin price prediction, and discussed an alternative crypto project with enormous promise. </p>
<p>While Pi Coin &#8216;IOUs&#8217; are pumping in price on several exchanges, it is important to remember the project itself has not authorized any listings and told users not to participate.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is another potential alternative to Pi Coin, available to buy now at the presale.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What will Pi Coin be worth in 2023?</strong></p>
<p>By 2023, the Pi Coin open mainnet should be released and the ecosystem will have had some time to mature. As a result, we expect to see lows of $22 and highs of $300</p>
<p><strong>What will Pi be worth in 2025?</strong></p>
<p>With more time to grow, the Pi network ecosystem will likely have expanded in a big way as developers look toward efficient smart contract platforms. As such, our Pi coin price prediction places the asset at around $35 on the low end or $400 if it performs well.</p>
<p><strong>What will Pi Coin be worth in 2030?</strong></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s hard to offer an accurate estimate so far into the future, as the global adoption of cryptocurrency picks up, we could see Pi Coin trade for between $40 and $500. </p>
<p><strong>What was the starting price of Pi Coin?</strong></p>
<p>Pi Coin&#8217;s starting price was $12.9 before its upswing to $292. The token has now retraced and is accumulating around the $27 mark.</p>
<p><strong>What was Pi Coin&#8217;s highest price?</strong></p>
<p>The highest point Pi was able to reach was $292 shortly after the release of its mainnet. The token has now retraced around the $27 mark. But the marketing conditions may push it further up soon.  </p>
<p><strong>Is Pi Coin a good investment?</strong></p>
<p>Pi Coin has multiple upsides. However, its initial mining fundamentals have been put into question as of late as the world is now veering towards proof-of-stake. That said, the development of an Open Mainnet is ongoing, which will likely be released by the end of 2023 that will tell us more about whether it might be a worthy investment later. That said, the current market signals state the Pi will remain in the accumulation range for a long time &#8211; at least, until major news about it arrives. </p>

<p>Interoperability-focused crypto project Quant has been performing well recently, prompting investors to look for a Quant price prediction.</p>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ll be taking a detailed look at Quant, providing a Quant price prediction for 2023 to 2030, and discussing an alternative investment that offers even more potential for growth than Quant. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<h2>Quant Coin Price History</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Originally released in June 2018, <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><u>Quant (QNT)</u></a> is a cryptocurrency project focused on facilitating interoperability between networks via the use of an operating system known as an Overledger. Since its release, the project has built an impressive list of partnerships with high-profile entities, including the Digital Pound Foundation. </p>
<p>Quant was first launched as an initial coin offering (ICO) with QNT tokens being sold for $1.51. The project raised an impressive $15 million from its ICO, with investors likely speculating that the project would grow significantly thanks to its inherent intrinsic value and plethora of uses within the crypto-sphere. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91442/316635/quant-price-history.jpg" alt="Quant to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Following its official launch in late 2018, the QNT token quickly fell to around $0.25 as tokens acquired during the presale were dumped on the market. This is a common occurrence in an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-private-sales.htm"><u>crypto private sale</u></a> and not something to worry about.</p>
<p>November 2018 marked the launch of Quant&#8217;s primary claim to fame, the Overledger. As hype built surrounding this event, the QNT token rocketed toward a high of $3.21, more than a two-fold increase compared to its ICO price.</p>
<p>Following the launch of Overledger, QNT slowly gained value as Quant began to rise in prevalence, and its ecosystem began to entice developers looking to develop cross-chain applications. This resulted in QNT tripling in value over a relatively short time, increasing to $15.74 by November 2020. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91442/228995/interconnected-world-quant.jpg" alt="Quant project" /></figure>
<p>While QNT successfully posted near 1000% returns for its early investors within just two years, 2021 is when QNT became mainstream and really began to take off. Despite beginning the year at a price of just $11.02, the token quickly built up steam thanks to a number of upgrades and listings on centralized exchanges (CEX), including Binance and Coinbase. </p>
<p>As a result of its various updates and exchange listings, the QNT token exploded in value, briefly hitting as high as $427, an increase of more than 3700% from its January 2021 lows. Naturally, this led Quant to be featured in a huge range of publications, further boosting the network&#8217;s prevalence and cementing its status as one of the year&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm"><u>best altcoins</u></a>.</p>
<p>While the asset yielded huge returns for early investors, QNT&#8217;s growth halted. The asset struggled to maintain its swollen valuation and slowly decreased in value over the coming months. While 2021 provided a slight rebound for QNT, the token dropped sharply in the ongoing bear market, trading as low as $42.6 in June 2022. </p>
<p>While the token’s decline coincided with the overall downtrend in the crypto space, QNT provided massive growth in the coming months. QNT soared from the $42 mark in June to more than $200 in October 2022. After this price spike, the token corrected to $105 by the end of 2022. </p>
<p>However, QNT soared to $160 by January 25th, 2023, marking more than a 50% jump in under 4 weeks. In the last trading week of January, QNT pushed back to the $135 level. After correcting by 4% on February 1st, the token soared by 10% on February 2nd, 2023. </p>
<p>Quant performed inside volatile zones throughout the first quarter of 2023. February 2023&#8217;s peak was followed by a gradual correction to $110 before bouncing to $113 by the end of March. The taken then followed a correcting trend in April, moving to lower regions before bouncing from $108. A minor retrace happened soon after and Quant is now trading around the $104 mark.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late 2018</strong> &#8211; Quant officially launched and immediately fell to $0.25.</li>
<li><strong>Late 2018</strong>  &#8211; QNT surged to $3.21 ahead of the Overledger release.</li>

<h2>Quant Price Prediction 2023</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With QNT performing well in recent months, things are looking promising for the Quant crypto price. The asset has already managed to bounce back from its June 2022 lows of $42 to a price of $160 towards the end of January 2023. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91442/316636/quant-price-ytd-till-q3-2023.jpg" alt="Quant to usd chart" /></figure>
<p>However, the $160 level acted as a resistance line, as the token corrected to $135 by the beginning of February. Currently trading at $104, QNT will look to break past its next newly formed resistance in the coming weeks and months. </p>
<p>After the successful performance of Quant following the QNT surge, it seems likely that investors will continue to pile in, hoping to earn a profit. As per the technical analysis provided by TradingView, Quant is a ‘Buy’ as per the 1-month price charts. Moreover, by the end of 2023, we expect this cryptocurrency to trade between the $160 and $200 mark. </p>
<h2>Quant Coin Price Prediction 2024</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking further ahead, by the end of 2024, Quant will have had plenty of time to begin picking up traction once again. </p>
<p>If QNT remains bullish, we could see some impressive growth from the asset. However, if QNT flips bearish, it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll see the asset decline, testing key areas of support along the way. One of the key support zones could be around the $200 mark. In October 2022, QNT plunged from the $200 level to nearly $100 in the following month. </p>
<p>As we move later into 2024, the price of Quant will be swayed in no small part by the outlook of the wider crypto market and the economy as a whole. When assets are growing, a greater number of investors get involved. Conversely, many potential investors often get scared off if the market is declining. </p>
<p>As of now, the crypto market appears to have found a bottom, with some assets beginning to show signs of strength. This could lead to a very positive 2024 for crypto. Thus, we expect QNT to reach a high of <strong>$250</strong> by the end of 2024. </p>
<h2>Quant Price Prediction 2025</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking further ahead, for our Quant price prediction 2025, as long as there is no significant market crash, it&#8217;s likely that QNT will have soared to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous top of $427.</p>
<p>In 2020, the distributed ledger technology market was valued at just $3 billion, with this figure expected to grow to $39.7 billion by 2025. <br /> </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91442/228997/quant-designed-for-future.jpg" alt="quant multi-chain feature" /></figure>
<p>As a greater number of companies get involved with cryptocurrency and begin to implement blockchain technology, the need for the services provided by Quant will increase massively. This is likely to do wonders for the Quant crypto price. </p>
<p>With Quant working hard to onboard new businesses and dream up new uses for Overledger, we&#8217;ll likely see Quant unveil a list of new partners by 2025. This could be huge for the Quant token price. With the cryptocurrency already working with huge brands like Oracle and AWS, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to see a big name added to Quant&#8217;s list of partners. </p>
<p>By 2025, we may see QNT hit highs of around <strong>$500</strong>, with possible lows coinciding with the asset&#8217;s previous all-time high of $427. </p>
<h3>Quant Price Prediction 2030</h3>
<p>While it can be difficult to provide a precise estimate for so far into the future, there are a few factors that we can look at to determine where the price of Quant could head. </p>
<p>Naturally, the rate at which cryptocurrency adoption increases will play a large part in the success and growth of Quant. As the number of investors and companies grows, demand for QNT can also increase. QNT also has a limited total token supply of 14.6 million. </p>
<p>As seen with low-supply assets like Bitcoin, the demand often increases in the long term as investors are fighting for a limited number of tokens. PricePrediction.net, a crypto predictions website, has predicted an average price of <strong>$2,500 </strong>for QNT by the end of the decade. This would equate to more than a 15x price increase from current levels. </p>
<p>Other platforms, such as BeInCrypto, have predicted a high of nearly $1,600 for QNT by 2030. With many analysts being bullish on the price of Quant, QNT is of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm"><u>cryptos with the most upside</u></a> potential.</p>

<h2>Where To Invest In Quant?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To invest in Quant, we would recommend Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest exchange by trade volume and monthly visitors. It has double the monthly visits and double the 24-hour trade volume of the next largest exchange &#8211; OKX. All of this growth happened within about 7 years, the exchange being founded in 2017. So there is no shortage of choice with Binance. </p>
<p>It also has a large suite of products, including loans, futures, spot, NFTs, staking, project launchpads, and more. It also provides its own self-custody wallet, allowing users access to the world of Web3. This means assets can be swapped cross-chain at good rates. </p>

<p>The standard fee is 0.1% for regular users, reduced by 25% for purchases made in BNB, the native token. There are no deposit fees whatsoever. Binance claims to have the lowest transaction fees among all major exchanges. It has a large list of coins and regularly adds new ones. </p>
<p>Currently, QNT is priced at $98 on Binance. It should not take longer than 5 or 10 minutes to get a verified account with Binance, and signup is known to be quick. Additional verification is required depending on how much you wish to invest. </p>

<h2>Is Quant the Best Crypto to Invest in Today?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With Quant making headlines recently as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>fastest-growing cryptocurrency</u></a> projects, it&#8217;s no surprise that investors would wonder whether it was the best asset to invest in today. As mentioned in our Quant price history, the token soared from $40 in June 2022 to more than $200 in October of the same year. </p>
<p>However, the token has experienced high levels of volatility throughout 2022 and into 2023. After reaching a price of $200, the token dropped by nearly 50% in November 2022, and is still yet to recover today. Due to the unpredictable nature of the economic markets in the past few years, even the biggest cryptocurrency assets may not be safe bets. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91442/316637/wall-street-memes-best-we.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes home page" /></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a> is an emerging memecoin project that combines humor, internet culture, and famous movie catchphrases to create an engaging cryptocurrency experience. Since its launch just a month ago, the project has achieved remarkable success, closing in at almost $13 million in its presale phase.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of tokens is set aside for community rewards, with a significant role played by airdrops within the project&#8217;s ecosystem. Wall Street Memes has announced an exciting event: a $50,000 giveaway will be divided among five winners who actively follow the project&#8217;s social media channels.</p>
<p>For those looking to maximize their potential gains, now is the ideal time to participate in the presale of Wall Street Memes. By joining early, investors can position themselves as early supporters of the project and potentially enjoy substantial benefits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wall Street Memes has caught the attention of Elon Musk on Twitter, as he recently interacted with the project&#8217;s Twitter account.</p>
<p>With over a million followers on social media accounts, Wall Street Memes has garnered a positive community sentiment. Considering the project&#8217;s current trajectory, early investors who participate in the presale could potentially witness significant returns in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ve taken an in-depth look at what Quant does and provided a detailed Quant price prediction. However, during our research, we came across another project that could have more upside due to being early in its roadmap. </p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is a community-powered memecoin project that has already amassed a massive social media following. It is leveraging its quirky origins and the community&#8217;s sentiments towards memecoins to gain traction in the market. </p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Does Quant have a future?</strong></p>
<p>Quant is one of only a few crypto projects that could be around long into the future. The project solves important issues within the crypto space and with it establishing a long list of powerful partners, it&#8217;s unlikely to disappear anytime soon.  </p>
<p><strong>When was Quant coin launched?</strong></p>
<p>The Quant coin was initially launched in early 2018 as an initial coin offering (ICO) with tokens selling for $1.51. However, the asset was officially released in late August 2018 with the price of QNT quickly dropping to just $0.25 as ICO investors sold off their stockpiled coins. </p>
<p><strong>Is Quant a good investment?</strong></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s impossible to see for certain whether Quant will make for a good investment, things are looking very positive for the asset currently. With Quant already working with a number of high-profile entities and only picking up traction, we could see some impressive growth from QNT. </p>
<p><strong>What will Quant be worth in 2025?</strong></p>
<p>Looking into the future, it&#8217;s likely that Quant will be in the spotlight far more by 2025. We expect this token to reach a high of $500 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Will Quant reach $1000?</strong></p>
<p>In the coming years, Quant has the potential to be one of the strongest performing cryptocurrency assets. As per our prediction, the QNT token can trade as high as $2,500 by 2030. </p>

<h2>What is a Crypto Robo Advisor?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>On the surface, it can be difficult to determine exactly what a crypto robo advisor is. However, almost every robo advisor shares a common goal and a similar feature set. </p>
<p>A crypto robo advisor is essentially a computer or mobile application designed to automatically assist people throughout the investing process. Keeping an eye on the markets to ensure that a portfolio always remains optimal can be extremely time-consuming and inefficient.</p>
<p>However, robo advisors utilize advanced algorithms to generate actionable advice on the best times to buy and sell as well as which assets to invest in, similar to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">crypto signals group</a> but powered by algorithms rather than an actual person.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most robo advisors will offer recommendations, helping investors to build a well-diversified portfolio with the goal of providing the maximum returns while keeping risk low. As such, the best crypto robo advisors will typically utilize long-term strategies (often focused on 3-5 year periods at a minimum). </p>
<p>With crypto robo advisors being generally focused on making the investing process as simple as possible, they&#8217;re most popular among beginner investors and those new to the crypto space. </p>
<h2>How Do Crypto Robo Advisors Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before using any crypto robo advisor, it&#8217;s crucial to understand exactly how they work and function. While some investors might think that robo advisors are constantly searching for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-big-crypto.htm">next big crypto</a>, it&#8217;s far more common for them to invest in established, large-cap projects and focus on long-term returns rather than short-term gains. </p>
<p>The algorithms utilized by crypto robo advisors to generate tips and recommendations are essentially step-by-step instructions that change based on the results of a previous step. This allows robo advisors to which assets are likely to perform well and which aren&#8217;t. It&#8217;s common for these advisors to filter through thousands of data points before generating advice. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/93906/234676/robo-advisor-featured.jpg" alt="How Robo Advisors Function" /></figure>
<p>By carefully analyzing these data points, robo advisors can produce actionable tips to reduce risk and maintain targeted returns. It&#8217;s common for a robo advisor to offer recommendations when it comes to constructing a portfolio, ensuring that the investor is including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">cryptos with the most upside potential</a>. </p>
<p>A phenomenon known as &#8216;portfolio drift&#8217; is common with long-term investments. The term refers to the changes in portfolio allocation that occur as assets rise and fall in price. If left unchecked by an investor, this can eventually lead to large problems. However, a robo advisor will ensure that a portfolio remains balanced in accordance with a chosen strategy. </p>
<p>Furthermore, some crypto robo advisors will offer support for loss harvesting for tax purposes. This system keeps track of and buys and sells, helping to reduce any capital gains tax that is accrued through investing. </p>
<p>To summarize, the best crypto robo advisor will constantly monitor the market and any price changes to ensure that the investor&#8217;s portfolio remains aligned with a chosen strategy through portfolio rebalancing and actionable tips, including recommendations on which assets to purchase. </p>
<h2>Why Use a Crypto Robo Advisor?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With the demand for crypto robo advisors growing by the day, there is naturally a large number of reasons why utilizing this technology can be beneficial and help to improve the investing experience. We&#8217;ve highlighted a few of our favorite uses for crypto robo advisors. </p>
<h3>Maximize Returns</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most common reason why people are flocking toward crypto robo advisors is to maximize their return on investment. While it can be difficult and time-consuming to track thousands of crypto assets in an attempt to find the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrencies</a>, robo advisors automate the process, providing specially tailored recommendations. </p>
<p>Although using a crypto robo advisor doesn&#8217;t guarantee immediate, massive returns, they can drastically improve a person&#8217;s chances of outperforming the market by following a specific strategy. </p>
<h3>Invest with Ease</h3>
<p>The crypto market is rapidly expanding and the number of people invested in the asset class has been climbing sharply over the past few years. Naturally, this has led to an increased number of beginners entering the market and investing for the first time. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency market is packed with complex terminologies, making things difficult for new investors. However, robo advisors can make the investing experience far more simple by closely monitoring portfolios and providing tailored recommendations, making them perfect for new market participants. </p>
<h3>Limit Risk</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons why crypto robot advisors have gotten so popular is for risk management. Robo advisors can take in a huge amount of data and use it to ensure that a portfolio remains within a predetermined risk tolerance. Considering this can take hours manually, it&#8217;s no surprise that robo-advisors have become so popular. </p>
<h3>Stick to a Strategy</h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for investors to aim to follow a specific investing strategy, it&#8217;s far easier said than done. When the market is moving, it doesn&#8217;t take much to get caught up and rush to buy a particular asset. However, working with a robo advisor makes it simple to stick to a specific strategy, lowering the risk associated with long-term strategies like dollar-cost-averaging.  </p>
<h3>Reduce Time Spent Investing</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get lost in the markets and spend hours per day researching the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> to invest in. However, because a cryptocurrency robo advisor can automatically scan for opportunities, they can drastically reduce the amount of time that needs to be dedicated to researching assets, boosting the time a person has for more important tasks. </p>
<h3>Receive Targeted Advice</h3>
<p>On the internet, there is a huge amount of advice related to investing in cryptocurrency. However, the majority of these tips are generalized, meaning they can actually cause more harm than good if not fully understood. This issue can be alleviated as a robo advisor offers recommendations specific to a portfolio.</p>
<h2>Are Crypto Robo Advisors Profitable?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discussed the different ways in which crypto robo advisors can be used, it&#8217;s time we discuss their potential in terms of profits. There is a massive number of factors that can affect the profitability of crypto robo advisors, but we&#8217;ll be breaking down a few of the most impactful. </p>
<h3>Trading Strategy</h3>
<p>Every robo advisor will follow a slightly different strategy, meaning returns can differ significantly from platform to platform. While it&#8217;s common for robo advisors to adhere to a similar ethos (providing low-risk returns), the way goals are achieved varies greatly. Some advisor platforms will issue recommendations solely based on algorithms, while others retain a human element. </p>
<p>With this in mind, it&#8217;s important to research the strategies utilized by a specific provider in order to fully understand the potential of a platform and to ensure that there won&#8217;t be any nasty surprises later down the line.</p>
<h3>Investing Goals</h3>
<p>When first beginning to use a robo advisor, it&#8217;s common for an investor to input their goals. For example, whether they want to invest solely in crypto, aim to maximize returns or reduce risk, or invest in a specific segment (e.g. Web3, DeFi, etc),</p>
<p>Naturally, a person&#8217;s specific goals can increase or decrease profits in a big way. While using an aggressive strategy like buying low-cap assets can yield greater returns, it&#8217;s also possible to lose more from bad trades. While just about every robo advisor will aim to be profitable, it&#8217;s important to consider investing goals when working out potential profits. </p>
<h3>Time Frame</h3>
<p>When considering how profitable crypto robo advisors can be, it&#8217;s important to consider time frame. Most platforms aim to produce long-term returns in order to account for any volatility in the market. Because most robo advisors prioritize stable returns over longer periods, it can be a good idea to explore other avenues when attempting to generate immediate profits. </p>
<h3>Wider Crypto Market</h3>
<p>While robo advisors aim to outperform the crypto market, any large movements will still have a significant impact on profits. During a bull run, robo advisors will generate more profits whereas, in a bear market, they will generate less. As such, it&#8217;s important to consider the wider crypto market to get a basis for potential profits.  </p>

This scenario could expand the crypto market cap by hundreds of billions of dollars. It might also improve the price of BTC and altcoins. </p>
<p>However, Bitcoin ETF Token could 10x or more, outperforming all others. This is due to the fact that the DeFi token was created with this precise event in mind, and is positioning itself accordingly. </p>
<p>Other key roadmap milestones include the launch of the first BTC ETF, the global BTC ETF AUM market hitting $1 billion, and the price of Bitcoin reaching $100,000. As each of these milestone targets are acquired, 5% of the supply is burned. So the burn mechanism, a core part of the campaign, is linked to important market phenomena. </p>
<p>There are five milestones in total, for a 25% token burn. This is a large figure and can serve to improve the price of the remaining coins. Of the remaining token allocation, 40% (840 million) is reserved for the presale, 25% (525 million) is allocated to staking, and 10% (210 million) goes to DEX liquidity. </p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a transparent token allocation with nothing reserved for core members, and the campaign enjoyed a clear smart contract audit from Coinsult.   </p>

<h3><b>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; New Stake-to-Mine Crypto is Decentralizing Cloud Mining, $BTCMTX will Rise By 30.9% on Presale  </b></h3>
<p>Our #1 DeFi coin to invest in right now is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX). This new project leverages DeFi mechanisms such as token staking to decentralize cloud mining operations. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1314" height="683" class="aligncenter wp-image-123832" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745606-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745606-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 1314w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745606-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745606-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x532.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745606-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1314px) 100vw, 1314px" /></p>
<p>While mining Bitcoin and other cryptos can be rewarding in the long term, it requires huge investments and fixed costs to get started. Therefore, mining presents a huge entry barrier to everyday individuals. Bitcoin Minetrix will connect with third-party operations to offer rented mining times to investors. </p>
<p>While there are many third-party renting corporations, Bitcoin Minetrix is the first to decentralize this process. Investors will be awarded with cloud mining credits &#8211; ERC-20 tokens that are stored on a digital ledger. This offers more transparency and autonomy to the token holders, as there is less chance of committing fraud or stealing tokens. </p>
<p>To reap the benefits of this stake-to-mine cryptocurrency, investors must purchase $BTCMTX tokens. At the time of writing, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0113 during its ongoing presale round. By the final stage of the presale, the price will rise by 30.97% to $0.0148 per token. </p>
<p>After buying $BTCMTX, token holders can stake their holdings on an Ethereum-powered smart contract. This mechanism will generate ERC-20 cloud mining credits. Your credits can then be burned to acquire Bitcoin mining power and earn allocated mining times. This will allow investors to earn a percentage of Bitcoin and crypto mining revenues. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1147" height="572" class="aligncenter wp-image-123837" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745939-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix tokenomics" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745939-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics.png 1147w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745939-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745939-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-1024x511.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745939-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-768x383.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698745939-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1147px) 100vw, 1147px" /></p>
<p>This new DeFi coin is off to a great start during the presale &#8211; having raised more than $2.8 million in a few weeks. The presale is distributing 2.8 billion tokens across 39 presale rounds and hopes to raise over $33 million. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; ERC20 DeFi Token Offers Steady APY, Raises $1M, Offers $5K Giveaway</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is a multi-meme platform with the appeal of many memes, not just one. This DeFi ecosystem offers three primary means of ROI. The first is the APY, which is 112% throughout the presale but will switch to dynamic staking after presale completion. </p>
<p>The second is straight price appreciation. At present, the token price is $0.1667, which will rise to $0.183 shortly (a 10% increase). The price could increase further at different presale stages and upon DEX exchange listing.  </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="440" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125759" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43.png" alt="Meme Kombat Presale Homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The third ROI mechanism is income from wagers on the combat itself. The DeFi ecosystem provides meme vs meme warfare. So you might see Doge vs Floki, Pepe vs Shiba Inu, or Sponge vs Wojack. Special promotional fights take place at given intervals. Users can research the odds and upcoming fights to see if they would like to make a bet. </p>
<p>Rewards are distributed automatically on the blockchain, which helps in terms of transparency. The founder of this presale is publicly accessible on social media and the smart contract audit results revealed no serious errors or flaws within the code. The team is launching a $5k giveaway shortly.</p>
<p>There is a total of 120 million tokens with 50% allocated to the presale, 30% to staking, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to the community. $1 million out of the $10 million hard cap has been raised throughout this presale.</p>
<p><iframe title="&#x1f525; This &quot;NEW&quot; Coin Is Launching SOON! &#x1f525; New MEMECOIN?! &#x1f438;&#x1f4a5;&#x1f525; VERY EARLY ! &#x1f525; NEXT PEPE MEMECOIN ?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QbfOWnIHR9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The could be a 10x or 100x coin in 2023 if some of the gigantic online meme communities hear about it and start to place bets on their favorite memes. </p>

<h3><strong>5. Scorpion Casino –  Regulated and Licensed Social Gambling Platform with Daily Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>SCORP is a utility-rich DeFi crypto with excellent use cases in the fast-growing online gambling and betting market. It is the native cryptocurrency of <a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN" rel="nofollow"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a>.</p>
<p>Scorpion Casino sets itself apart from competitors with a strong blockchain foundation, which makes it provably fair and transparent. Something that the gambling industry has long been missing. And therein lies the large growth potential of SCORP.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/276981/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino Live Presale Page" /></figure>
<p>As the governance and reward token of Scorpion Casino, SCORP fuels two of its components primarily.</p>
<p>The first is a licensed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">crypto sports betting</a> and casino platform that gives you access to more than 30,000 bet opportunities monthly. The 200+ casino games listed on the platform include slots, blackjack, roulette, poker, and 160 live games. The sports-betting section, on the other hand, covers a wide range of football, tennis, American football, horse racing, basketball, golf, boxing, and MMA events.  </p>
<p>The second is a reward &amp; referral affiliate system. If you’re holding SCORP, you won’t just benefit from its long-term value appreciation. You can earn up to $10,000 as daily passive income too. The re-distribution system integrated into the smart contract rewards you based on the casino&#8217;s performance. A deflationary token-burning mechanism helps maintain a healthy value for the token in the open market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Scorpion Casino has taken diverse measures to feature a safe and secure gambling experience for users. This is clear from its choice of providers, which is limited to highly reputed platforms like Evolution, NetEnt, Play N Go, Novomatic, EGT, and AMATIC. To provide the best user experience, Scorpion Casino has partnered with leading platforms like CoinsPaid and BitRadar as well.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/276982/scorpion-deal.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino Deal" /></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify">As one of the top emerging players in the online gambling and betting markets, Scorpion Casino has already secured a listing with a top-tier centralized exchange. Follow the platform on <a href="https://t.me/scorpioncasino"><u>Telegram</u></a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino"> <u>Twitter</u></a> to get the latest updates about upcoming listings and roadmap milestones. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The best way into Scorpion Casino is the ongoing SCORP presale, which has now raised more than $1 million.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>7. Chainlink &#8211; Leading Provider of Oracle Solutions</strong></h3>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is a DeFi cryptocurrency dedicated to bringing off-chain data sources onto the blockchain to be used by other web3 projects, massively expanding the use cases of new crypto projects.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/252812/screen-shot-2023-01-25-at-1-35-19-pm.jpg" alt="LINK Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>With Chainlink being one of the first projects to offer such a service, it has been picked up by key players and become the go-to platform for a number of the best DeFi crypto projects including Aave, Hedera, and Compound. </p>
<p>As Chainlink&#8217;s services are in such high demand, it&#8217;s of little surprise that LINK has remained one of the strongest assets on the market, even during the recent crypto downturn. </p>
<p>With many investors touting LINK as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto</a> projects available, and the asset showing huge amounts of strength whenever the market enjoys a slight run-up, we&#8217;ll be watching closely to see how it performs once the next bull run begins. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy LINK on eToro</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>8. XRP &#8211; Project Aiming to Decentralize Currency Conversion</strong></h3>
<p>XRP has been a favorite asset of crypto investors since its release as a fast settlement, low-fee, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-sustainable-cryptocurrency.htm">sustainable cryptocurrency</a> alternative to Bitcoin. The asset has created by David Schwartz and Jeb McCaleb who then went on to launch Ripple Labs in order to create use cases for XRP.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/252813/screen-shot-2023-01-25-at-1-36-05-pm.jpg" alt="XRP Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>As we touched on, the primary attraction to XRP is its extreme efficiency. Transactions can be settled in just seconds and cost only a fraction of a cent, making it one of the fastest and cheapest networks on the market. Furthermore, the  release of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2021 has expanded the project&#8217;s use case by allowing other projects to be created on the network. </p>
<p>The primary use of XRP is as a transactional cryptocurrency. It has already partnered with leading international currency transfer services like Swift and MoneyGram, leading many investors to consider the asset as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm">10 best penny crypto projects</a> currently available. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy XRP on eToro</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>9. Tezos &#8211; Easily Upgradable Ethereum Competitor </strong></h3>
<p>Tezos (XTC) is a DeFi DeFi coin that is akin to a more efficient, easily upgradable Ethereum. The project was conceptualized in 2014 but it wasn&#8217;t until far later in 2018 that the Tezos mainnet was officially released. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/252815/screen-shot-2023-01-25-at-1-36-54-pm.jpg" alt="XTC Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>The project allows developers to build applications using the Tezos network through smart contracts. The project is consistently regarded as being a great alternative to Ethereum as the Tezos network can be easily upgraded with zero downtime, meaning the team can always ensure that the network boasts the latest technology. </p>
<p>With the  Ethereum merge, the need for on-the-fly upgradable blockchains has become more apparent than ever before. With Tezos offering this functionality in an incredibly efficient package, many crypto fanatics regard it as being one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos to buy</a> in 2023. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy Tezos on eToro</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>10. Avalanche &#8211; Low-Cost Layer-1 Blockchain </strong></h3>
<p>Similar to Tezos, Avalanche (AVAX) is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> and a highly-efficient layer-1 blockchain. The project exploded in 2021 at the height of the &#8216;Ethereum killer&#8217; narrative, promoting a huge amount of P2E games and web3 projects to make the switch to the Avalanche network. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/252818/screen-shot-2023-01-25-at-1-38-23-pm.jpg" alt="AVAX Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>While the hype surrounding the project has subsided over recent months, its technology remains powerful. One of the main reasons why Avalanche was able to pick up traction so quickly was its massively impressive throughput. </p>
<p>Rather than treating every kind of transaction as one, Avalanche settles transactions on three different chains. The C-Chain is used to settle transactions that originate from the best DeFi coins and web3 projects, X-Chain is used for sending and receiving AVA, and P-Chain is for network validators. </p>
<p>While AVAX has fallen a long way from its 2021 highs, the DeFi DeFi coinis trading at $17. While investor confidence has likely been shaken a bit following its dramatic fall, once the next bull run kicks off we could see impressive returns from AVAX.  </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy AVAX on eToro</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>11. Maker &#8211; DAO Behind Leading Stablecoin</strong></h3>
<p>Maker (MKR) is a governance token that investors can use to make decisions in the Maker decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), that controls the popular stablecoin DAI. With the DAI stablecoin rapidly gaining market share falling the fall of algorithmic dollar-pegged stablecoin UST, MKR could be the best DeFi crypto to buy this year.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/252819/screen-shot-2023-01-25-at-1-39-26-pm.jpg" alt="MKR Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>As, by design, stablecoins don&#8217;t have any room for growth (unless something goes seriously awry), the MKR token is used to provide value to investors and fans of the project. As anyone holding MKR can vote on the development of DAI, and the price of MKR is linked to DAI&#8217;s success, this system should, in theory, ensure that only the best decisions are made regarding the future of the stablecoin.</p>
<p>Out of all the best DeFi projects to invest in, Maker fits perfectly in the industry. MKR is currently priced at $665 per token, as of January 2023. With the need for a trusty stablecoin more apparent than ever, we could see big things from this DeFi cryptocurrency in the coming months. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy MKR on eToro</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>12. Loopring &#8211; Advanced Ethereum Layer-2 Scaling Solution</strong></h3>
<p>While there was a large demand for Ethereum alternatives, the focus has now shifted to Layer-2 scaling solutions like Loopring (LRC). These projects utilize the Ethereum network but commonly settle transactions in a different way. This means that Layer-2 solutions benefit from Ethereum&#8217;s security but aren&#8217;t held back but its lackluster throughput. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/252820/screen-shot-2023-01-25-at-1-40-27-pm.jpg" alt="LRC Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>In order to achieve higher throughput than its parent network, Loopring bundles multiple transactions together off-chain, before settling them together on-chain at a later date. This allows the project to validate transactions far more efficiently than Ethereum, reducing fees and network congestion. </p>
<p>With its partnership with GameStop, Loopring has been brought into the limelight. While it&#8217;s yet to enjoy a meaningful move to the upside, there&#8217;s plenty of hype surrounding the project meaning it could end up being one of the best DeFi projects to invest in ahead of the market&#8217;s recovery. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy LRC on eToro</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>13. Uniswap &#8211; Decentralized Exchange and DeFi Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Created by former Ethereum developer Hayden Adams, Uniswap (UNI) is packed with pedigree. It is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that hosts some of the best DeFi projects to invest in right now. During the DeFi explosion, the platform enjoyed widespread notoriety and quickly become one of the most used DEXs on the planet. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/252821/screen-shot-2023-01-25-at-1-41-14-pm.jpg" alt="UNI Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>UNI was created as a governance token, allowing fans of the project to help forge its future. With Uniswap (alongside PancakeSwap) remaining one of the largest decentralized trading protocols on the market, clearly, this model worked.</p>
<p>Although Uniswap can no longer be considered a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-low-cap-crypto.htm">low-cap crypto</a> with its multi-billion dollar market cap, the project remains a favorite of DeFi-centric investors worldwide. While the smaller DeFi projects that live on Uniswap have been hit hard by a downtrend, it&#8217;s likely that Uniswap will enjoy huge amounts of volume after these projects begin to draw attention once again. </p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/"><strong>Buy UNI on eToro</strong></a></p>
<h2><strong>What are DeFi Coins?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>DeFi is short for decentralized finance. This refers to any sort of financial application that does away with a central authority and instead allows users to act for themselves. For example, on the PancakeSwap platform users provide liquidity in order to earn interest, with the platform then using an algorithm to match a buyer and liquidity provider. </p>
<p>With cryptocurrency having a heavy focus on both finance and decentralization, there are a huge number of projects that could be considered DeFi coins. We&#8217;ve already discussed some of the best DeFi crypto projects to watch but a few other notable examples include Aave, The Graph, and Fantom.</p>
<p>To summarize, any cryptocurrency that has a focus on finance or decentralization can be considered a DeFi coin. As decentralization requires that there is no central body controlling an application, it&#8217;s common for DeFi coins to be largely autonomous, hence the inclusion of a large number of DAO-based projects on our list. </p>
<h2><strong>Are DeFi Coins a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With decentralized finance growing in popularity massively over the past couple of years, the best DeFi cryptos can make for solid investments. However, as with any sector, there will be projects that fail to perform as expected. </p>
<p>With that said there are now DeFi 2.0 projects which is an umbrella term for a new era of decentralized finance ecosystems. Read our article on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-defi-2-0-projects.htm">best DeFi 2.0 projects</a> for more details.</p>
<h3><strong>Multitude of Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>As we briefly touched on, DeFi coins can comprise a huge variety of sectors and use cases. With such diversity, the future of DeFi holds near-endless possibilities. With what&#8217;s possible in cryptocurrency constantly changing, DeFi projects are set to evolve as blockchain technology improves, making the best DeFi investments great for getting exposure to a future-first market.</p>
<h3><strong>Future of Finance</strong></h3>
<p>Decentralized finance has already disrupted the traditional finance sector in a big way and with cryptocurrency adoption steadily rising, this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. While it&#8217;s impossible to know for sure how things will progress as the DeFi market matures,  few sectors can compete with DeFi when it comes to future potential. </p>
<h3><strong>Adheres to the Crypto Ethos</strong></h3>
<p>At the core of the cryptocurrency ethos is decentralization, the belief that no one individual or organization should have total control. With this concept being important to many die-hard crypto investors, projects that respect this, tend to generate more buzz from key players in the industry. </p>
<h3><strong>Early Mover Advantage</strong></h3>
<p>While finance in the traditional sense has been around for centuries, the DeFi revolution is only just starting. The cryptocurrency market as a whole has existed for just over 10 years and DeFi far fewer. As such, the sector has seldom had time to mature. With this in mind, investing in DeFi can provide users early access to what could eventually become the new financial system. </p>
<h2><strong>Where to Buy DeFi Coins</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In order to assist investors looking to purchase DeFi coins, we&#8217;ve reviewed one of the top regulated platforms on which they can be acquired. </p>
<h3><strong>eToro &#8211; Best Platform to Buy DeFi Coins</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro </a>was launched back in 2007 and has since grown in popularity massively, serving millions of users all around the globe. Being one of the world&#8217;s leading brokers, eToro supports a plethora of DeFi coins as well as other cryptocurrencies and even stocks. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/222233/etoro-crypto-splash.jpg" alt="Own Crypto on eToro" /></figure>
<p>eToro supports over 50 of the most popular crypto assets and allows users to buy and trade them with just a 1% commission. As such, crypto investors are able to get far more value for their money when compared with other large exchanges which often charge anywhere between 2-3% on purchases. </p>
<p>In addition to its low fees, the platform&#8217;s security is also phenomenal. eToro encrypts all sensitive data before it leaves the user&#8217;s device, ensuring that it&#8217;s of no use to nefarious individuals attempting to intercept traffic. Furthermore, the platform uses cold storage for the vast majority of client funds. Therefore, even if eToro was compromised, clients wouldn&#8217;t be left out of pocket. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88377/222231/etoro-crypto-site.jpg" alt="Crypto Prices on eToro" /></figure>
<p>For investors that are just getting started and want to learn strategy or simply get used to trading, eToro has the perfect tool. The broker offers a social trading platform that allows users to automatically mirror the trades of other users. Those wishing to copy trade can view the performance of the users they&#8217;re able to copy, helping to ensure transparency. </p>
<p>For investors looking to buy the best DeFi project, eToro is a great choice. It&#8217;s an extremely capable exchange that offers a plethora of the best DeFi coins as well as plenty of other financial instruments. </p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Decentralized finance is one of the hottest sectors in cryptocurrency right now. Throughout this article, we&#8217;ve looked at some of the best DeFi cryptos currently available, discussed the merit of DeFi as an investment, and reviewed the top DeFi exchange. </p>
<p>One of the top cryptocurrencies we reviewed in this guide is Bitcoin ETF Token. Aside from its high dynamic yields, presale discounts, and 25% token burn, the campaign is intimately tied with SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs. </p>
<p>Should this approval occur, we think it could be one of the best-performing coins on the market. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What crypto coins are DeFi?</strong></p>
<p>DeFi simply means decentralized finance. As such, a huge number of crypto coins fall under the category. In the strictest sense, DeFi coins are the native tokens of DeFi protocols, such as Maker (MKR) which powers the Maker decentralized lending platform &#8211; a way for people to benefit from loans without the need of a centralized entity like a bank. Some people apply the term more loosely.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best DeFi Coin to invest in?</strong></p>
<p>Each of the projects we&#8217;ve reviewed has plenty of room for upwards growth. Many can be invested in as part of a DeFi portfolio on eToro.</p>
<p><strong>Are DeFi Coins worth it?</strong></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s important to understand that every project is different, the best DeFi coins have historically yielded excellent results for early investors. So, while it&#8217;s crucial to perform ample due diligence, DeFi coins can make for solid investments.  </p>
<p><strong>What are the best DeFi projects?</strong></p>
<p>The best DeFi project will vary greatly based on a particular investor&#8217;s goals. Most DeFi projects specialize in different areas so it&#8217;s important to consider what one is looking for prior to investing. One of the top DeFi projects we reviewed is Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; a new presale style with a roadmap designed to correlate with important events in the wider crypto ecosystem. This could be a 10x token if regulatory rulings are aligned and market conditions are appropriate. Plus, it provides many additional incentives to attract cost-conscious investors. <br /> </p>

<p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Industry Talk section features insights from crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>With the release of smart contracts, new consensus mechanisms, and improvements to network efficiency, the cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially in recent years, leading many investors to ask, is Ethereum a good investment?</p>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ll be taking an in-depth look at Ethereum, analyzing its utility and potential for growth in the future. Let&#8217;s get started.  </p>
<h2>Is Ethereum a Good Investment? Our Verdict </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With the asset growing by tens of thousands of percent since its launch, many investors are asking the question, is Ethereum a good investment? After conducting hours of detailed research into the topic, we&#8217;ve got an answer. </p>
<p>As the crypto market expands, there will likely be a sharp increase in the number of applications built upon the Ethereum network. This will naturally result in significantly boosted demand for the ETH token, in turn pumping the token&#8217;s price. </p>
<p>Ethereum is one of the most proactive blockchains in developing and upgrading its network and following <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-62891715">the Merge in 2022 &#8211; which cut energy usage by an estimated 99.95%</a> &#8211; other upgrades are in the pipeline, only helping to further boost its performance.</p>
<p>Ethereum remains, by far, the most popular network for decentralized app (dApp) builders and developers, with almost 1,000 major protocols built on its network as well as thousands of meme tokens and NFT collections. In fact, <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">Ethereum&#8217;s TVL (total value locked, the combined value of projects built on its network) is over $21 billion</a>, more than three times nearest rival Tron ($6.7bn TVL).</p>
<p>That is unlikely to change any time soon making Ethereum, by far, the most useful cryptocurrency and giving it a huge network of reliant projects &#8211; even if that isn&#8217;t always reflected in the current price of ETH.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we&#8217;ve reached a positive verdict on whether Ethereum is a good investment. While the coming months are likely to be rather rocky, over the long-term Ethereum should perform quite well.</p>
<h2>How Ethereum Has Performed Since Launch &amp; in 2023</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Ethereum has been performing well since its official launch in 2014, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-successful-icos-all-time/">when the price of ETH was just $0.31 during its initial coin offering (ICO)</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the asset&#8217;s past performance, it will have likely provided great returns to investors that gave it enough time to grow. Regardless of when an investor picked up ETH, historically, it&#8217;s been possible to turn a profit simply by waiting, making ETH a great <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long-term crypto</a> investment. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/95010/237292/etheruem-featured.jpg" alt="Ethereum coin logo" /></figure>
<p>Investors that bought into the asset during its 2018 highs, would&#8217;ve had to wait until at least 2021 just to break even. However, given that ETH was held to the bull run&#8217;s peak, investors could&#8217;ve netted themselves returns of around 275% or an annualized rate of 91.66%. Furthermore, anyone that invested during the 2017 high would&#8217;ve secured 482% in returns. </p>
<p>With this in mind, while it&#8217;s true that anyone that bought ETH at the peak of the 2021 bull would be down roughly 65% at today&#8217;s prices, given enough time they could end up securing huge returns, especially given the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ethereum-upgrade-unlock-over-30-billion-crypto-tokens-2023-04-12/">continued improvements to the Ethereum network</a>, that have massively boosted efficiency, scalability and transaction price.</p>
<p>The same is true for investors that got involved during the January 2022 dip, while they would currently be down around 53%, given a few years in the market, it&#8217;s possible that ETH could yield annualized returns similar to its last run. As such, ETH could be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-during-the-crash.htm">best crypto to buy in the crash</a> right now.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price History </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Launched back in 2014, Ethereum has grown from a humble initial coin offering (ICO) into a titan of industry and the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market. The asset, now boasting a price tag of around $1,600 was originally sold for just $0.311 during its ICO, a discount of 99.97% compared to today&#8217;s figure. </p>
<p>As Ethereum&#8217;s smart contract ecosystem grew and began to attract attention from developers, the price of ETH exploded, rising from a 2017 low of just $8.17 to a high of $820.24, an increase of nearly 10,000%. Naturally, this fast growth led many investors to wonder is investing in Ethereum a good idea.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/95010/332116/ethereum-all-time.jpg" alt="Ethereum price chart" /></figure>
<p>This trend continued into 2018, with Ethereum growing massively. Likely helped along by the fact that the world&#8217;s largest blockchain game (at the time), CryptoKitties was built on the Ethereum network, leading many other developers to follow suit. At its peak price in 2018, the price of ETH soared, hitting $1,270.47.</p>
<p>However, what goes up must come down. Over the next couple of years the price of Ethereum, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrencies</a> on the market at the time, slowly declined. Throughout 2018 ETH fell as low as $90.60 and traded between $150 and $200 during 2019. Over this same period, the price of Bitcoin fell from $19,118 to a low of $3,460.55. </p>
<p>The ETH price stayed within this range until late 2020 promoting crypto enthusiasts everywhere to wonder will Ethereum go up. While things were looking bleak, the cryptocurrency market picked up significantly as thousands of investors entered the market, pushing ETH to new heights, first taking the asset to $4,174, then even further to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">an all-time high of $4,878.26 on November 10, 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the market, Ethereum has suffered through a prolonged bear market since those highs, with macroeconomic factors such as the Russia-Ukraine War, inflation, plus the collapse of various crypto companies, including FTX, seeing the price dip below $1,000 in mid-2022.</p>
<p>ETH has been rising steadily in 2023 &#8211; and was up as much as 77% between January and June to a high of $2,100 &#8211; but has since taken a step backwards leading to its present-day valuation of around $1,600.</p>
<h3><strong>Ethereum Highs and Lows</strong></h3>
<p>Below, we&#8217;ve summarized the highs and lows of Ethereum since its launch, putting the asset&#8217;s growth in perspective, and making it simpler to determine is Ethereum a good investment. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early 2014 &#8211;</strong> Ethereum was released as an ICO with ETH available for around $0.311</li>
<li><strong>Mid-2017 &#8211;</strong> Ethereum slowly grew, then exploded in 2017, rising from $8.17 to $820.</li>
<li><strong>Throughout 2018 &#8211; </strong>More investors piled into the market, pushing the price of ETH to $1270.47.</li>
<li><strong>During 2019 &#8211;</strong> After hitting a new high in 2018, ETH incrementally declined, falling to $175.</li>
<li><strong>Late 2020 to 2021 &#8211;</strong> The crypto market rapidly grew, causing ETH to surge to $4,733.</li>
<li><strong>Throughout 2022 &#8211;</strong> Ongoing bear market that saw collapse to a low of $990 in June 2022.</li>
<li><strong>January 2023 to June 2023</strong> &#8211; Started the year at $1,100 and rose to $2,100 in June.</li>
<li><strong>July 2023 to Present Day </strong>&#8211; Has since dipped and currently trading at around $1,600</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ethereum Price Forecast </h3>
<p>We understand that a large number of investors are trying to decide &#8216;is Ethereum worth buying?&#8217; To help make this process a bit easier, we&#8217;ve opted to include an Ethereum price prediction spanning from 2023 to 2030. </p>
<p>To ensure that our forecast is as accurate as possible, we&#8217;ve taken a huge variety of different factors into account. A few of these include the economy as a whole, the crypto market, potential competitors, and even Ethereum&#8217;s utility as well as any planned updates to the network. Let&#8217;s dive into our prediction.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/95010/332120/eth-all-time.jpg" alt="ETH to USD price chart" /></figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023 &#8211; </strong>Looking toward the end of next year, we could expect to see growth from Ethereum, however, the market will likely remain bearish as a reaction to uncertainty in the economy. As a result, we could see ETH test a previous support of <strong>$1,800</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2024 &#8211; </strong>Moving onwards, as long as nothing unexpected occurs, we&#8217;ll likely see the economy begin its path to recovery, something likely to have a very positive impact on the crypto and stock market. The next Bitcoin halving is also approaching, which has sparked all previous bull runs. This will likely lead to Ethereum trading for an average of <strong>$3,000</strong>, an increase of around 75% over today&#8217;s prices. </li>
<li><strong>End of 2025 &#8211; </strong>With more time to build positive traction, continued updates and widespread crypto adoption, we could see some impressive moves from the price of ETH during 2025. It seems likely that a retest of the asset&#8217;s prior high will be required. This would place the value of ETH at approximately <strong>$4,900</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2030 &#8211;</strong> The Ethereum team will have had plenty of time to work on developing new features and any improvements to the network currently in the pipeline may have rolled out. Combined with the expected growth of the crypto market (11.1% annually), we could see ETH hit $7,985 with a high of <strong>$10,000</strong> also possible.</li>

<h2>Ethereum Utility &#8211; What Does the Future Hold?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When it comes time for an investor to answer the question, should I buy Ethereum now, it&#8217;s crucial to consider the project&#8217;s long-term utility &#8211; which is among the very best in the crypto space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to predict the market&#8217;s movements with 100% accuracy, but investing in utility-centric projects drastically increases the chances of an investment paying off over the long term. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/95010/237299/ethereum-utility.jpg" alt="Ethereum utility stylized" /></figure>
<p>To make it more simple for investors to determine whether Ethereum holds enough utility to be considered a worthwhile investment, we&#8217;ve outlined a few of its top uses below.</p>
<h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most widely used feature of the Ethereum network is its smart contract capabilities. Developers can build their own decentralized applications known as dApps, directly on the Ethereum network. This helps to facilitate interoperability between applications and allows new projects to take advantage of the various benefits offered by an established network like Ethereum.  </p>
<p>Numerous high-profile and highly important protocols are based on Ethereum, including the likes of Lido, Maker, Aave and Uniswap. A number of the largest meme coins in the space are also ERC-20 tokens, powered and secured by Ethereum, including Shiba Inu, Pepe and Floki.</p>
<p>As applications created on the Ethereum network boost demand for the ETH, this could be phenomenal for the long-term growth of this innovative <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">proof-of-stake crypto</a>.</p>
<h3>Network Upgrades</h3>
<p>The recent update to the Ethereum network, known as the Merge, switched Ethereum from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. This has created a new economy on the network, with ETH holders able to earn rewards for validating transactions and adding to the network&#8217;s security. This incentivizes long-term holds and rewards the project&#8217;s top supporters. </p>
<p>On top of introducing staking to the network, the Merge has paved the way for sharding to be introduced to the network. This will allow transaction data to be split among the network, sharply increasing throughput and reducing congestion during periods of load.</p>
<p>Ethereum is one of the most active networks for consistently trying to improve and upgrade its network.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>One of the greatest benefits of the Ethereum network is its security. Achieved through decentralization, Ethereum is considered to be one of the most secure networks on the planet. </p>
<p>As a result, it&#8217;s commonly used for sensitive applications, like Aave which is a crypto lender and Lido, which offers liquid staking. With the rate at which crypto hacks are increasing, developers will aim to build on secure networks, boosting the demand for Ethereum. </p>
<h3>NFTs</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/22/nfts-worthless-price">NFT sector has struggled badly since the 2021 boom</a> &#8211; much more so than crypto investment &#8211; but it remains one of the most rapidly evolving areas in cryptocurrency. A large portion of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">best NFTs</a> are built on the Ethereum network, including the likes of Crypto Punks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club.</p>
<p>Naturally, this has drastically increased the number of transactions taking place on the network, booting its dominance. With NFTs quickly being picked up by mainstream companies this is very promising for Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Is Ethereum a Good Long-Term Investment or Short-Term Investment?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>For investors considering is now a good time to buy Ethereum, it&#8217;s important to have an investing plan in place. This means determining which prices to buy and sell at and also deciding whether you want to hold Ethereum as a long or short-term investment. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be discussing the merit of ETH with both strategies, making it simple for investors to choose the one right for them.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/95010/237300/ethereum-investing-tine.jpg" alt="Coins stack" /></figure>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering should I invest in Ethereum over the short term, it&#8217;s important to take the performance of the wider economy into consideration. With assets across the board taking a beating and mass uncertainty being present in the crypto market, it&#8217;s probably best to avoid a shorter-term investment in ETH, until the market gets a clear directional bias. </p>
<p>On the other hand, as a long-term investment, Ethereum has excellent merit &#8211; the project boasts a wide array of utilities, a strong use case and is consistently attempting to improve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a number of the world&#8217;s largest crypto-assets are built upon the Ethereum network, a clear indicator of longevity. As it stands today, anyone holding ETH for at least 2 years would be in profit, so ETH could work well as a long-term hold.</p>
<h2>What Experts Say on Whether You Should Invest in Ethereum </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Many experts have strong feelings on the topic is Ethereum still a good investment. While hundreds of prominent figures have shared their opinions regarding this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm">top trending crypto</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital.com</strong>, a popular broker discussed the potential of Ethereum saying that the improvements to the network&#8217;s scalability and throughput are likely to offer a sizable long-term boost to the asset. The broker summarized predictions from various outlets, almost all of which offered a positive outlook over a 6+ month period.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>, a well-known media outlet shared the thoughts of Mike McGlone, an intelligence analyst for Bloomberg. McGlone predicted that Ethereum could end 2022 trading for roughly $4,000 to $4,500. However, another market analyst, Wendy O expects ETH will drop to around $750, providing a mixed answer to the question is Ethereum a good investment. </li>
<li><strong>WalletInvestor </strong>a prominent price prediction platform, shared its rating for Ethereum giving the smart contract network an A+. The predictions platform also stated that according to their forecasts, an increase in the price of Ethereum is expected over the coming years making it a solid long-term pick. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to Buy Ethereum </h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<h2>Should I Buy Ethereum Now? Our Verdict </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered the factors influencing our verdict, it&#8217;s time to answer the question, is it still a good time to buy Ethereum? </p>
<p>While the short-term outlook of just about every financial market leaves a lot to be desired right now, Ethereum seems to be very strong in a macro sense. Just about every long-term (2+ years) ETH holder would currently be in profit, with the only exception being those that invested during the 2021 bull run. As such, it&#8217;s clear that Ethereum provides a great long-term opportunity.</p>
<p>With Ethereum boasting strong utility and a clear plan for future developments, our Ethereum price predictions look rather promising. While 2023 might be a slow year for crypto, we expect that ETH could reach between $7,500 to $10,000 during 2030, an increase of 350% on the low end.</p>
<p>While the experts seemed mostly divided on how Ethereum might perform over the short term, one thing was clear, long-term growth was expected by most. It seems as though most people believe Ethereum will play a crucial role in the crypto space over the next few years, so it&#8217;s not an asset to overlook. </p>
<p>All in all, while its short-term potential is murky, Ethereum seems like a strong long-term investment. As such, it could be a good time to buy Ethereum, for investors focused on the macro perspective.  </p>
<h2>Coins to Consider Alongside Ethereum</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve answered the question is Ethereum a good investment, it seems fitting to discuss a couple of smaller projects built on the Ethereum network, that could provide even greater returns than ETH.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; ERC20 Presale With 450% Dynamic APY And Market-Focused Roadmap</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is an Ethereum-powered presale with a dynamic APY PoS of 450% at the current time and a roadmap that is tied to important events in the wider crypto economy. </p>
<p>The primary event is the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Should this event manifest, it could increase the total crypto market cap by hundreds of billions of dollars, and possibly result in price increases for BTC and altcoins. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="439" class="alignnone wp-image-130890 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> </p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF token, however, stands to benefit the most, as it was created with this exact scenario in mind. It could be a 10x token or more if approval occurs, something which could happen in a matter of weeks. </p>
<p>The ERC20 presale also provides a 25% token burn to encourage price appreciation for the remaining supply. The token burn takes place in five distinct intervals dependent on key events, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the price of Bitcoin breaching $100,000. </p>
<p>So this is a campaign that is tied to the market, as opposed to being a self-contained ecosystem with arbitrary goals. It has a market focus that differentiates it from many other presales. Aside from this, it offers a significant price increase throughout its presale. </p>
<p>In the initial round, the token retails at $0.0050, a price which will rise substantially to $0.0068 by the final round (round ten). This is an automatic price increase of nearly 40% simply for buying and holding coins. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="384" class="alignnone wp-image-130891 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05-300x128.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05-768x328.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This could be an ideal Ethereum alternative with more upside potential and a number of incentives for investors. </p>
<p>The presale maintains a dedicated section on its website for BTC ETF-related news, along with its official <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Telegram</a> accounts. </p>

<h3>Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Stake-to-Mine Project Offering Huge 6,000% APY During Presale</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is a brand new ERC-20 token launched on Ethereum that is the world&#8217;s first stake-to-mine crypto project.</p>
<p>The project has only just launched its presale but is seeing a lot of interest from investors and has already raised more than $200,000.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/95010/332127/bitcoin-minetrix-cloud-mi.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix cloud mining" /></figure>
<p>As well as offering incredible staking rewards &#8211; with the current APY sitting at over 6,000% &#8211; Bitcoin Minetrix token holders can also mine Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This works by staking tokens which then generate cloud mining credits. They can be burnt to earn allocated mining time, with mined BTC sent back to the user.</p>
<p>The whole process is managed via a dedicated mobile app and takes all the risk out of cloud mining &#8211; which has been a hotbed for scammers &#8211; by tokenizing the process.</p>
<p>That means there are no upfront fees or long fixed-term contracts to agree, with Bitcoin Minetrix holders able to stake as much or as little as they like and unstake at any time and sell their tokens on an exchange.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Is Ethereum a good investment in 2023?</strong></p>
<p>Every investor will have a different opinion of what constitutes a good investment. However, with Ethereum constantly working on developing new features and with most people expecting ETH to slowly increase in value, Ethereum could be a good investment in 2023. </p>
<p><strong>What Ethereum be worth in five years?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to predict the value of an asset in the future, but based on the growth of the crypto market and the planned improvements to the Ethereum network, we could see the value of ETH at around $5,000 by 2025 and around $7,500 in five years times. </p>
<p><strong>Is it worth buying Ethereum now?</strong></p>
<p>Is Ethereum a good investment? This is the question on the minds of thousands of investors. Right now, ETH can be purchased for around $1,700, a significant discount compared to 2021&#8217;s prices. As such, if you were debating buying ETH at $4,000+ it&#8217;s most probably worth buying today. </p>
<p><strong>Is Ethereum a safe investment?</strong><br />There is no such thing as a safe investment. Everything has risks. However, the general consensus among professional investors and traders seems to be that Ethereum will grow steadily over the coming years. </p>

<h2>Analyzing the Best Private Token Sales </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To provide investors with ample information, we&#8217;ve included detailed reviews of the best crypto private sales below. We&#8217;ve included projects that span a wide range of sectors and networks in order to provide the most comprehensive guide possible. </p>
<h3>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Overall Best Crypto Private Sale With 25% Token Burn And 40% Presale Price Increase</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is the overall best crypto private sale in the market, according to our research team. This is because it has a roadmap that is deeply tied to the wider markets as well as offering several attractive investment incentives. </p>
<p>These incentives include a dynamic APY that currently sits above 500%, a 25% burn of the total token supply, and a definitive presale price increase from $0.0050 (round one) to $0.0068 (round ten). This amounts to an increase of nearly 40%. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130370" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Homepage" width="900" height="443" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-768x378.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> </p>
<p>The core theme of Bitcoin ETF Token is the approval of BTC ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If this happens, something which many analysts have suggested, it could have major implications for the entire market. But few coins are likely to benefit as much as Bitcoin ETF Token, which was created with this exact scenario in mind. </p>
<p>The roadmap explained in the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token Whitepaper</a> outlines five major milestones &#8211; the $BTCETF coin reaching $100 million in trade volume, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF for trading, the total AUM of the Bitcoin ETF market reaching $1 billion, and the price of Bitcoin reaching $100,000. </p>
<p>As each of these milestones is met, 5% of the token supply is burned and the burn tax is reduced by 1%. This amounts to a total 25% burn, which is a large figure by private sale standards. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130371" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Staking Information" width="900" height="373" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1-300x124.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1-768x318.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>So far, this presale has raised $500,000 out of its $5 million hard cap, within a week. There are 840 million tokens available out of the total 2.1 billion supply. </p>
<p>It could sell out quickly, and early investment is preferred from a financial standpoint, due to a lower entry price and a higher APY. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Stake-to-Mine Crypto Offers Bitcoin Mining Power and Huge Staking Returns, Soaring on Presale </strong></h3>
<p>We recommend <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> as the overall best crypto private sale to look at right now. This new cryptocurrency platform combines token staking and cloud mining. </p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix reduces the entry barrier to cloud mining by leveraging the $BTCMTX token. Cloud mining is a process where individuals rent mining power from large corporations to save on the costs of purchasing equipment themselves. However, these cloud mining corporations often conduct dubious activities and scam investors. </p>
<p>Therefore, Bitcoin Minetrix will tokenize the cloud mining process. Investors can purchase and stake $BTCMTX tokens through the ongoing token presale. The staked tokens will generate cloud mining credits &#8211; ERC-20 non-tradable tokens. Since these tokens are recorded on the blockchain, it is impossible to steal the funds. Therefore, individuals get more transparency and security with Bitcoin Minetrix. </p>
<p>These credits can be burned on the Bitcoin Minetrix ecosystem to earn Bitcoin mining power. This is used to get allocated mining times to earn a share of the mining rewards. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Minetrix is rewarding staked token holders with an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) of more than 2,500%. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/332310/bitcoin-minetrix-cloud-mining.jpg" alt="" width="1142" /></figure>
<p>The $BTCMTX token is currently available to purchase through a private sale. From a total supply of 4 billion, 2.8 billion tokens have been allocated for the presale. The presale will consist of ten rounds, each allocating 280 million tokens. In less than a week, Bitcoin Minetrix has raised more than $300K. The goal is to collect a hard cap of $32 million. </p>
<p>During the ongoing presale round, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.011 per token. The price will jump to $0.0119 by the final round.

<h3><strong>3. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Popular Meme Crypto Platform Raised $25M on Presale, Now Listed on OKX and Huobi</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Streets Memes</a> is a meme cryptocurrency platform that is popular across various social media platforms. </p>
<p>Launched in 2019, Wall Street Memes has more than 1 million followers. The creators have decided to launch their own native token, $WSM. This comes after Wall Street Memes launched its own legacy NFT project, Wall St Bulls. This NFT project’s first collection comprised of 10,000 Ethereum-based NFT pieces, which sold out in 30 minutes. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/332309/wsm-popular-memes.jpg" alt="" width="1252" /></figure>
<p>After the success of the NFT project, Wall Street Memes had decided to launch the token presale, which began on May 26, 2023. This was the same day that the NFT project also introduced a new Ordinals mint for Wall St Bulls. </p>
<p>Promoting itself as a meme token, Wall Street Memes does not offer much utility.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/86983/277549/wsm-token-home.jpg" alt="" width="1224" /></figure>
<p>But, it’s aim is to build wealth for the community by leveraging its large movement comprising of over 1 million followers. 50% of $WSM was available for the presale, 30% will be offered as community rewards, and the remaining will be allocated for exchange listings. </p>
<p>Thus, 100% of the tokens will be distributed among the platform members. Through the $WSM token presale, Wall Street Memes raised more than $25 million. In September 2023, the token was launched on OXK and Huobi &#8211; two of the biggest crypto exchanges in the space. </p>
<p>Currently, the token is trading over the $0.06 mark &#8211; nearly a 2x price jump from the token’s final presale price of $0.0337.</p>
<p>Interested investors can join the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes">Wall Street Memes Telegram channel</a> to learn more about the project. </p>

<h3><strong>5. WeSendit &#8211; Blockchain-Powered Gateway to Decentralized Storage</strong></h3>
<p>WeSendit (WSI) is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-upcoming-icos.htm">best upcoming ICO</a> (initial coin offering) projects on the market. The team behind the project aims to revolutionize the data storage sector by providing users with easy access to a wide range of established platforms that provide decentralized data storage services. The private sale is ongoing on the WeSendit website.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/227847/wesendit-website.jpg" alt="WeSendit website" width="1058" /></figure>
<p>WeSendit aims to improve privacy in the data storage sector through the use of decentralization. With the project being an established player in the sector for an impressive 10 years, WeSendit certainly has the experience necessary to perform well. The project will allow users to access a range of providers like Filecoin and Storj without hassle, making life far easier for users. </p>
<p>Overall, WeSendit is one of the most interesting private sales currently ongoing. The project has been spoken about in a number of well-known publications including G2.com and with a fully doxed team, WeSendit is doing well on the transparency front. With that said, only time will tell how the WSI token performs on the open market. </p>
<h3><strong>6. Leap &#8211; New Project Providing a Platform for Sports People to Get Scouted</strong></h3>
<p>Leap (LEAP) is an innovative new cryptocurrency project that aims to change the way new talent is scouted in the sports industry via the creation of a platform that centers fans, talent, and decision-makers in a single location. The Leap private sale is expected to launch on October 31st with whitelist registration currently ongoing. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/227848/leap-website.jpg" alt="leap website" width="1057" /></figure>
<p>With the sports industry being worth hundreds of billions, a project with the potential to improve it could end up as one of the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm"> best long-term crypto</a> projects out there. While the core functionality of Leap is still in the works, LEAP token holders will be able to stake their tokens for rewards, vote on decisions regarding the project&#8217;s future, and get early access to the platform. </p>
<p>While we&#8217;ll have to wait and see how the Leap platform develops, the project is unique and does show promise. With that said, private sales are risky investments so it&#8217;s always imperative to perform ample research before investing. </p>
<h3><strong>7. WeSleep &#8211; Earn Crypto Rewards for Sleeping</strong></h3>
<p>Building on the various x-to-earn concepts that have become popular in the crypto space over the past year, WeSleep is a new project that allows its users to earn crypto rewards simply for sleeping. The project features two different tokens, $ZZZ (for rewards) and $WEZ (for everything else). The WeSleep private crypto sale is currently open for registration. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/227849/wesleep-website.jpg" alt="wesleep website" width="1076" /></figure>
<p>The project was created on the Solana blockchain, helping to keep fees low and settlement speed high. In order to engage users, the project will reward users with WEZ for completing various tasks which can then be staked to earn ZZZ. Similar to StepN, the rate of earnings will be based on the attributes of upgradable WeSleep NFTs. </p>
<p>Investors looking for the best private token sales in 2023 should keep an eye on WeSleep. The project seems to be well-designed and features a fairly unique concept, meaning it could perform similarly to StepN and become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> soon after its release.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Panaroma &#8211; Private Crypto Sale Creating an Investor-Focused Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>Panaroma (PANA) is a new project aiming to build a crypto exchange that puts investors first. To achieve this, Panaroma aims to increase transparency within the sector, providing users with the lowest possible fees and access to a variety of exclusive crypto assets. Registration for the project&#8217;s private sale is currently ongoing.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/227850/panaroma-website.jpg" alt="panaroma website" width="997" /></figure>
<p>The project aims to create a new breed of investing platform by building both a centralized and decentralized exchange, an NFT marketplace, and even a launchpad for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ieo-cryptos.htm">best IEO cryptos</a>.  The PANA token will power the entire ecosystem with holders receiving exclusive access to certain projects and reduced fees, similar to the FTT token from FTX. </p>
<p>While there is a wide range of different exchanges out there, few offer the number of features touted by Panaroma. As such, the project is up there with the best crypto private sales but as always its imperative to perform the proper due diligence before investing. </p>
<h3><strong>9. VitalVeda &#8211; Utilizing the Blockchain and Virtual Reality to Create a Metaverse Gym</strong></h3>
<p>VitalVeda (VVG) is another project worthy of consideration for investors on the hunt for the best crypto private sale. The project will utilize blockchain technology, the Metaverse, and virtual reality in order to create a virtual gym of sorts, allowing people all over the world to come together and get fit. The founder has been KYC verified by IDOPresales and the private sale is ongoing. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/227851/vitalveda-website.jpg" alt="videlveda website" width="1059" /></figure>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, people struggled to stay healthy as the typical avenues, such as gyms, fitness classes, etc were all closed. However, VitalVeda aims to get a platform that can help people achieve their fitness goals from the comfort of their own homes. To incentivize exercise, the project will reward holders of any VVSW NFT with crypto for staying fit.  </p>
<p>While move-to-earn projects have become rather prevalent, VitalVeda has a much larger focus on helping people with specific goals (e,g, building strength and losing fat). With personal trainers costing upward of $30 per hour, VitalVeda could end up being the best crypto private sale within the fitness sector. </p>
<h3><strong>10. Stackspace &#8211; Crypto Private Sale Creating the Next Generation of Digital Marketplace</strong></h3>
<p>Stackspace (STSP) is a project aiming to create the largest and most diverse digital market within the crypto space. The project is focused on NFTs in all forms but will specialize in gaming/Metaverse-related assets. The Stackspace private sale is open for registration and will run until November 12th. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/90880/227853/stackspace-website.jpg" alt="stackspace website" width="981" /></figure>
<p>To appeal to a larger audience Stackspace will be a multi-chain marketplace, allowing a huge number of projects to be listed on its platform. Additionally, the team will create a launchpad for Metaverse games assets, allowing investors to participate in the best crypto private sales with ease. The project will initially release as a website, before launching an app and a Visa-based crypto card. </p>
<p>With Stackspace aiming to unseat the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-marketplaces.htm">best NFT marketplaces</a>, it&#8217;ll be extremely interesting to see how the STSP token performs once it&#8217;s fully released. However, it&#8217;s important to be aware that the value of the token will be heavily affected by the performance and growth of the marketplace. </p>
<h2><strong>What is a Private Crypto Sale &#8211; Explained</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before taking the plunge and investing in any of the best private token sales in 2023, it&#8217;s worth taking the time to understand exactly what a private crypto sale actually is. </p>
<p>As the name implies, private crypto sales tend to be exclusive offerings prior to a new token being offered to the public as an IDO or IEO. It&#8217;s common for a private crypto sale to require investors to be whitelisted or at least register for the sale ahead of time. Typically, these private token sales will offer new cryptos at the lowest price. </p>
<p>After a private crypto sale has concluded, the asset will then usually go on to announce a public sale typically taking the form of an initial DEX offering (IDO) or an initial coin offering (ICO).</p>
<h2><strong>How do Private Token Sales Work in Crypto?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While attempting to invest in the best crypto private sale can be a daunting task, it&#8217;s actually a very simple process. </p>
<p>The vast majority of private token sales will allow users to register prior to or during the event, meaning that there is usually plenty of time to get involved with a project. Private sales will typically offer tokens for a lower price than a public sale for a couple of different reasons. </p>
<p><strong>Risk &#8211;</strong> There is more inherent risk when investing in a private sale vs a public sale as the project is typically less developed.</p>
<p><strong>Funding &#8211; </strong>The revenue generated from a private crypto sale will help to facilitate marketing, the development of a project, and sometimes the minting of tokens. </p>
<p><strong>Rewarding Supporters &#8211; </strong>A private sale is typically the earliest stage in a cryptocurrency&#8217;s lifecycle. As such, tokens are priced lower to show thanks to a project&#8217;s first supporters. </p>
<p>The process of actually participating in the best crypto private sale will typically be very similar to purchasing an asset from an exchange. The investor registers for the sale then decides how many tokens to buy and completes the purchase, typically using a stablecoin or the native token of the network the project is built on.  </p>
<h2><strong>Private Crypto Sales vs Public Sales</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Any investor hunting for the best crypto private sale is likely to wonder about what separates private and public crypto sales. While both concepts are similar there are a few differences worth noting. </p>
<ul>
<li>Private sales are typically priced lower than public sales as the investor takes on more risk.</li>
<li>A private crypto sale is often the first time an asset is made available for purchase, whereas a public sale will be the second or third step in a project&#8217;s release.</li>
<li>While a private sale will usually occur directly on an assets website, a public sale will usually take place on either an exchange or project launchpad. </li>
<li>Cryptocurrency will almost always be required for a private sale while public sales can sometimes be purchased with fiat.</li>
<li>A private sale will typically offer far fewer tokens than a public sale, meaning they tend to take place over a shorter period than public sales. </li>
</ul>
<p>So as we can see from the above points, while private crypto sales and public sales are very similar, in concept, they differ greatly in execution. As such, it&#8217;s important to consider which type of sale is right for you prior to investing in a new cryptocurrency project. </p>
<h2><strong>Is Investing in Crypto Private Sales Worth it?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are lots of reasons why investing in the best private token sales in 2023 could be worth it. We&#8217;ve included a few of the most important factors below.</p>
<h3><strong>Low Price</strong></h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons why investors look for the best crypto private sale is to stock up on tokens at the lowest price possible. This provides investors with far more upside potential when compared to an already established project. As such, private crypto sales can be perfect for investing with the best possible risk-to-reward ratio.</p>
<h3><strong>Innovation</strong></h3>
<p>While established cryptocurrency projects are typically seen as lower-risk investments, they tend to lack innovation. However, the best crypto private sales will feature some of the most exciting and innovative technology in the industry. As such, they can be phenomenal investment tools for those focused on utility-centric projects. </p>
<h3><strong>Beat the Masses</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to investing, once the masses have piled in, the majority of any value a project held will evaporate due to a lack of buyers. As such, investing in a project before it&#8217;s widely known is perhaps the best way to profit from cryptocurrency. With private crypto sales being the first time an asset is purchasable, they provide an excellent opportunity to in a project early. </p>
<h3><strong>Support Great Projects</strong></h3>
<p>While the vast majority of people will treat private crypto sales as an investment vehicle and hope to make a profit, that&#8217;s only one side of the spectrum. Investors that participate in private sales can also support projects with a concept they like, potentially helping to get a revolutionary new project funded and available to the general public. </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Throughout this article, we&#8217;ve taken a look at some of the best crypto private sales, explained how they worked and discussed the merit of private crypto sales as an investment.</p>
<p>One of the top private sales right now is Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF). The 10-round presale offers an automatic price increase of nearly 40% along with an APY above 500%, and a market-driven roadmap with ties to the larger crypto economy. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><br /><strong>What is a private sale in crypto?</strong></p>
<p>A private sale in crypto is the first time an asset is made available for purchase. Typically, a private sale will offer the lowest prices for an asset. In contrast to a public sale which typically takes place on an exchange, a private sale will usually occur directly on the project&#8217;s website.</p>
<p><strong>How do you participate in private crypto sales?</strong></p>
<p>While it can be daunting, it&#8217;s easy to participate in private crypto sales. Typically, they will be held directly on a project&#8217;s website with investors able to exchange a certain cryptocurrency (e.g. ETH, USDT, etc) for tokens from the private sale.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between a private sale and a public sale in crypto?</strong></p>
<p>Although private and public crypto sales are both similar, there are a few important differences to be aware of. Private sales are generally viewed as being riskier than public sales but will offer tokens at a lower price to make up for the increased risk. Furthermore, private sales will usually take place over a shorter period with fewer tokens available when compared to a public sale. </p>
<p><strong>What are ICO private sales?</strong></p>
<p>An initial coin offering, or ICO, is the very first time an asset is made available to purchase. Typically an ICO private sale will be used to fund the marketing efforts for the larger public sale. It&#8217;s also common for the funds generated from an ICO to be used for token minting. </p>
<p><strong>What are the best crypto private sales right now?</strong></p>
<p>Above we&#8217;ve discussed some of the best private token sales in 2023 available at a low entry point. One of the top private sales is Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; a revolutionary platform that is offering a coin that could 10x pending BTC ETF approval by the SEC. Join the Bitcoin ETF Token presale before the price increases over ten rounds. </p>

<p>While Dogecoin was one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2021, the asset has since traded below its all-time high of that year, even with its main backer Elon Musk acquiring Twitter (now X).</p>
<p>In this guide, we&#8217;ll answer the question &#8216;is Dogecoin still a good investment&#8217;, forecast a Dogecoin price prediction spanning 2023 to 2030, and share a DOGE alternative that could perform well over the coming months.</p>
<h2>Is it too Late to Buy Dogecoin?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Is it too late to buy Dogecoin today? With DOGE dropping in 2022 to levels last seen in 2020, then bouncing in 2023, this question is becoming increasingly common among investors.</p>
<p>There are many factors influencing the price of DOGE at present as well as the meme coin&#8217;s future growth potential. We&#8217;ll explore all these issues later in this guide &#8211; as a quick preview, DOGE grew too quickly, high-inflation rates limited consumer crypto spending, and uncertainty arising from macro economic conditions have held back Bitcoin at the $30k resistance level.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, we believe that it is not too late to buy Dogecoin today. The asset will likely recover alongside the wider crypto market and even soar to new heights if Elon Musk utilizes the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">leading meme coin</a> as part of Twitter&#8217;s payment system.  </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/mexc" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy DOGE on MEXC</a>
<h2>Dogecoin Price History </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Dogecoin was launched in 2013 first priced at a fraction of a cent, initially tracked by CoinMarketCap with a price of $0.0003, and trading as low as $0.0000869 even well into 2015.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) caught traders&#8217; attention when it shot up in value by over 1,250% during 2021, hitting $0.74 following frequent promotions from Tesla&#8217;s CEO, Elon Musk, and his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL). Since then, DOGE has largely struggled to provide investors with high returns since that meteoric pump.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94060/324392/dogecoin-price-chart.jpg" alt="Doge Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>After slowly losing value throughout the second half of 2021 and the early months of 2022, DOGE plummeted by around 42.75% in late May 2022, hitting $0.0875. Following this collapse, the token traded within a range between $0.0567 and $0.0747 until late October. </p>
<p>As news of Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter acquisition circulated, investors piled into Dogecoin, speculating that the DOGE token would become a usable currency on the social media platform, an understandable conclusion considering Musk&#8217;s plans to monetize Twitter and his sentiment towards DOGE.</p>
<p>When DOGE shot up by close to 100%, investors went wild wondering, &#8216;should I still invest in Dogecoin?&#8217; However, following the collapse of the FTT token and subsequent purchase of the exchange by Binance, the majority of DOGE&#8217;s gains were retraced. </p>
<p>Then Elon Musk&#8217;s April 2023 move to switch Twitter&#8217;s bird icon with Dogecoin&#8217;s dog logo pushed the DOGE price back closer to its $0.1 mark. When he reversed that however, DOGE crashed.</p>
<p>As of late 2023, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.07, slightly above its yearly lows of just over $0.06.</p>
<h3><strong>Dogecoin Highs and Lows</strong></h3>
<p>To make it simple for investors wondering <i>is Dogecoin still going up?</i> we&#8217;ve summarized the significant highs and lows of DOGE. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2013 to 2017 &#8211;</strong> Since the launch of Dogecoin, the asset struggled to grow, trading for roughly $0.0003</li>
<li><strong>2017 to 2020</strong> <strong>&#8211; </strong>After gathering a bit of traction, the DOGE token rose up in value trading for between $0.0025 and $0.003. </li>
<li><strong>Q1 2021 &#8211;</strong> DOGE became one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrencies</a> following Elon Musk&#8217;s endorsements of the digital asset, climbing to a high of $0.74.</li>
<li><strong>Q2 2021 to Q2 2022 &#8211; </strong>DOGE slowly lost value eventually dropping to approximately $0.0875.</li>
<li><strong>Q3 2022 to Q4 2023</strong> <strong>&#8211;</strong> Despite a few brief pumps, DOGE remained largely dormant until late October when news of Musk&#8217;s Twitter takeover caused the asset to surge. However, DOGE quickly dropped following the collapse of FTX. </li>
<li><strong>Q1 2023 to Q3 2023 &#8211;</strong> Bitcoin&#8217;s bounce in Q1 2023 fuelled the growth of other altcoins, including DOGE, which went from $0.07 to $0.098 before a correction. Now with Bitcoin finding resistance at $30k, DOGE has retraced to $0.07.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Has Dogecoin Performed in 2023?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As is often the case with assets that have enjoyed a large upward move over a short period of time, DOGE has been falling in value quickly alongside the wider crypto market, testing key areas of support on its way down. </p>
<p>Dogecoin is still well below its ATH well into 2023, but to answer the question is it too late to buy DOGE, it&#8217;s important to understand the reasons why. </p>
<h3>Crypto Market Struggles</h3>
<p>In something of a feedback loop, as more people and institutions began to invest in crypto during 2021, prices surged as demand outpaced supply. However, as prices continued to climb, the number of buyers decreased while the number of sellers increased as long-time investors began to cash out positions that were in sizable profit. </p>
<p>Once the number of sellers grew larger than that of buyers, the price of key assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum began to fall, taking the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> like DOGE with them. Combined with record levels of inflation and debt following the Coronavirus pandemic, this led the entire crypto market on a sharp downward spiral, with prices of most assets hitting levels not seen since 2020. </p>
<h3>Investor Speculation</h3>
<p>As 2021 saw a large number of beginners enter the crypto market, there was a natural gravitation toward cryptos with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">high upside potential</a> like DOGE as new market participants hoped that they could attain similar profits discussed in headlines throughout the year. </p>
<p>While this speculation helped to pump DOGE, once the market began to turn sour, investors quickly lost confidence and sold their assets, causing DOGE to drop rapidly in the midst of immense selling pressure. </p>
<p>This sell-off was worsened by Musk distancing himself from crypto, selling 75% of Tesla&#8217;s BTC holdings as well as macroeconomic factors like record inflation and mass uncertainty resulting from Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions in the Middle East. </p>
<h3>What Does This Mean for DOGE?</h3>
<p>Although people are asking is it too late to buy Dogecoin today, things seem to be picking up. DOGE has built an extremely strong support at $0.05 &#8211; $0.06, and following Bitcoin&#8217;s move to the $30,000 level DOGE retested the $0.10 region.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Elon Musk is now at the helm of X and announced plans to begin charging for various features. If Musk decides to utilize DOGE for payments, we could see the asset explode, making DOGE one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-winter-tokens.htm">best crypto winter tokens</a>.</p>
<p>To summarize for those wondering is it still a good time to buy Dogecoin, while the asset fell over 90% from its all-time high to its 2022 low, DOGE seems to have found a bottom. As such, if the market continues to recover this year, we could see the Dogecoin price grow alongside it.</p>
<h3>Dogecoin Price Prediction 2023-2030</h3>
<p>While Dogecoin has had a troublesome year, the future continues to look bright for the meme coin. While Bitcoin dropping in price since 2021 has had a negative impact on DOGE, many investors have begun to call a market bottom, meaning that we could start to see some growth once again pushing DOGE into the realm of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers.htm">top crypto gainers</a>. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/94060/235010/dogecoin-sup-res.jpg" alt="DOGE support and resistance " /></figure>
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s ownership of X will likely play a large role in the future of Dogecoin &#8211; that takeover resulted in the rapid pump shown above, although the DOGE price has since retraced.</p>
<p>As the most widely known proponent of Dogecoin, Musk could continue to sway the market. The CEO&#8217;s actions over the coming months will greatly influence the answer to the question &#8216;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-dogecoin-a-good-investment.htm">is Dogecoin a good investment?&#8217;</a></p>
<p>One of the main draws to the Dogecoin network is the cryptocurrency&#8217;s use as a fast and low-cost transactional crypto. While a number of platforms have begun to accept the coin, continued adoption will be instrumental in the growth of DOGE. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023 &#8211; </strong>With some time for the cryptocurrency market to find its bottom and began to pick up, we could see the price of DOGE begin to reclaim key support/resistance zones. The most significant resistance level above the current price of DOGE may be $0.17.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2024 &#8211; </strong>By the end of 2024, it seems likely that the crypto market will once again show signs of positivity, helping to boost assets like DOGE. As the number of investors climbs and trading volumes increase, DOGE could hit approximately $0.326</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025 &#8211; I</strong>t seems likely that DOGE will be trying to build an area of support around its previous all-time high of $0.74 before a move upward. However, attention from Elon Musk or an excessive number of DOGE tokens getting minted could send this figure higher or lower.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2030 &#8211;</strong> As the cryptocurrency market matures, and DOGE adoption increases, it could pump massively making it the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long-term crypto</a>. This could take the price of DOGE above its previous all-time high and send the asset toward the key psychological resistance zone of between $1 and $1.20. </li>

<h2>How Could Dogecoin be Used in the Future?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Intrinsic value is perhaps the single largest driving force behind the value of an asset, whether crypto-based or otherwise. As a result, understanding what Dogecoin offers in terms of utility is crucial to answering the question should I still buy Dogecoin.</p>
<p>While being one of the oldest uses for Dogecoin, tipping is still one of the primary uses for the token many consider to be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-under-1-dollar.htm">best crypto under $1</a>. As crypto adoption grows, it seems likely that DOGE tipping will become increasingly commonplace. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/94060/235020/dogecoin-manifesto.jpg" alt="dogecoin manifesto" /></figure>
<p>Branching from its use as a tipping currency, DOGE also has potential as a payments-focused project. Similar to XPR or XLM, DOGE boasts extremely fast settlement times and offers low-fee transactions, making it an excellent choice for money transfers. </p>
<p>Before questioning is it too late to buy Dogecoin today, it&#8217;s worth considering its smart contract potential. A network known as Dogechain has been created recently, bringing smart contract capabilities to the meme coin. While not an official collaboration, if Dogechain becomes established, we could see it implemented into the official Dogecoin ecosystem. </p>
<h2>What Experts Say on Whether it’s Too Late to Buy Dogecoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To help our readers answer the question is it too late to invest in Dogecoin, we&#8217;ll be taking a look at the thoughts of a few different prominent figures in the cryptocurrency community. </p>
<p>Susannah Streeter, an investment and markets analyst with the leading firm Hargreaves Lansdown, told readers of the Wall Street Journal that there might not even be a good time to invest in DOGE. The respected analyst liked investing in meme-based assets like DOGE to gambling rather than investing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/94060/235008/doge-buy-indicator.jpg" alt="DOGE technical indicator" /></p>
<p>While Streeter shared a rather bleak outlook, crypto swaps platform Changelly shared much more positive findings. in an article, the platform indicated that DOGE is currently a strong buy and could climb as high as $0.19998 by 2023 and even further toward $2.71 as early as 2030.</p>
<p>Capital.com also shared its thoughts on the future of Dogecoin, offering a balanced opinion. The investment platform shared its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction.htm">Dogecoin price prediction</a>, highlighting figures from a myriad of analysts. The general consensus was that while Dogecoin could increase in value, any positive move would have to take place over the long term. </p>
<h2>Where to Buy Dogecoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Naturally, investors seeking an answer to the question is Dogecoin still worth investing in will need to know where to buy Dogecoin. We&#8217;ve shared our pick for the best DOGE exchange below. </p>
<h3>MEXC &#8211; Buy DOGE with 0% Spot Market Fees</h3>
<p>MEXC is a full-fledged crypto exchange with tools to cater both to beginners and seasoned traders. You can buy DOGE within a few minutes either via bank or SEPA transfer or a credit card purchase.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="509" class="alignnone wp-image-138327 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg" alt="MEXC homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701429233-mexc-homepage-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

<h2>Is it Too Late to Buy Dogecoin? Our Verdict </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discussed the ins and outs of Dogecoin, it&#8217;s time we present our verdict on the question is it too late to buy Dogecoin today. </p>
<p>Looking at the past prices of DOGE since its 2013 launch, we can get a good bearing on the overall direction of the asset. The price of DOGE has steadily risen since its inception and while 2021 yielded impressive results for the meme coin, the token&#8217;s value was heavily inflated by speculators trying to make a quick dollar, leading to DOGE&#8217;s sharp decline. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/94060/235007/doge-climbing.jpg" alt="Dogecoin To The Moon" /></figure>
<p>While considering the potential future performance of Dogecoin, we determined that the asset has a lot of room for growth and is potentially the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm">best penny crypto</a> to buy right now. We anticipate the DOGE could climb to $0.17 by 2024 and could reach as high as $1.20 by 2030. This would mark a well over 1,000% increase from today&#8217;s prices. </p>
<p>Although some crypto enthusiasts claim that DOGE lacks any real utility, it has potential as a transactional crypto and could worm its way into being a natively supported currency on X following Elon Musk&#8217;s takeover. If successful, this could lead to a significant pump for DOGE. </p>
<p>However, the analyst consensus for the future of DOGE is still largely mixed. While some could see the asset explode in value, others believe that the cryptocurrency will fizzle out as Musk moves on and losses interest in the asset. </p>
<p>So, is it too late to buy Dogecoin today? In our opinion, the answer is not at all. While it seems likely that the road to recovery for DOGE will take some time to transverse, the future looks bright for the meme coin. If Musk implements DOGE into the Twitter ecosystem we could see huge growth from the asset. Nevertheless, its status as a meme coin makes DOGE a high-risk investment.  </p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<h4><strong>Should I still buy Dogecoin right now in 2023?</strong></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering Dogecoin is still worth investing in, the answer is likely yes. However, as with any investment, it&#8217;s possible for the price of DOGE to go up or down. As such, it&#8217;s important to only invest what you can afford to lose. </p>
<h4><strong>Will Dogecoin ever go back up?</strong></h4>
<p>The growth of Dogecoin has been severely hindered by the falling cryptocurrency market. However, once the crypto market finds a clear bottom and begins to build up strength, we could see DOGE climb back up in value. </p>
<h4><strong>Can DOGE go over $1?</strong></h4>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that $1 is an important physiological level for Dogecoin, meaning DOGE will need quite some momentum to exceed this price point. However, as crypto adoption increases, it could be possible.</p>
<h4><strong>Can you still mine Dogecoin?</strong></h4>
<p>As a fork of the Litecoin network (which itself is a Bitcoin fork), Dogecoin uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism and can be mined. While this could change later down the line, it seems unlikely for the foreseeable future. </p>

<h2>How We Select the Best Plinko Gambling Sites</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discussed the best Plinko gambling sites, it&#8217;s time we explain our ranking system.</p>
<h3>Safe Crypto Payments</h3>
<p>To be considered the best Plinko gambling site, a platform needs to be able to facilitate safe deposits, otherwise, its customers will quickly lose faith in the platform.</p>
<h3>Quick Withdrawals and Deposits</h3>
<p>Nobody likes their money floating in purgatory. As such, we&#8217;ve included only platforms that offer fast, efficient, and low-cost withdrawals and deposits. However, it&#8217;s important to note that sometimes crypto deposits/withdrawals can be delayed due to network congestion. </p>
<h3>Promotions and Bonuses</h3>
<p>Almost every online casino or betting platform will offer various promotions and bonuses to incentive players to gamble on the site. These bonuses can be a great way to maximize your value for money, so it&#8217;s worth keeping track of each platforms offers. </p>
<h3>Low Fees</h3>
<p>Crypto Casinos should never have high fees. The only real cost is the network fee, which is typically between cents and a couple of dollars. As such, we&#8217;ve only included platforms that offer fair fees when it comes to depositing and withdrawing. </p>
<h3>Fair and Friendly Withdrawal/Deposit Limits</h3>
<p>Continuing on the topic of withdrawals and deposits, it&#8217;s important that a prospective platform offers fair limits to ensure that users won&#8217;t run into any trouble. Furthermore, we&#8217;ve also added weight to the rankings of platforms that offer a deposit/bet limiter.</p>
<h3>Good Variety of Different Betting Markets </h3>
<p>To keep players engaged, we&#8217;ve opted to include only platforms that offer a wide range of different games and support different betting markets. Generally, live casino games, slots, and sports betting are the most commonly offered markets.</p>
<h3>Strong Betting Features</h3>
<p>Naturally, for a platform to be considered the best Plinko gambling site, it&#8217;s got to have a strong set of features. We&#8217;ve tried to ensure that all of the platforms we&#8217;ve featured offer customizability, provably fair odds, and good support. </p>
<h2>What is Plinko?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Plinko is a fun game that sees players release balls through a board containing a number of pins, typically between 12 and 16. The pins will change the direction the ball is falling, eventually guiding it into a hole. Generally, the prizes in a game of Plinko will be tied to the resting place of the ball. Some Plinko boards will offer straight cash prizes while others multiply the bet amount. </p>
<h2>How to Play Plinko Online with Crypto</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While figuring out how to play Plinko online with crypto can be a confusing process, it&#8217;s simple once explained clearly.  Below, we&#8217;ve outlined the entire process in an easy-to-reference bullet point format. While we&#8217;ve highlighted the basics, every platform is different so it can be a good idea to familiarize yourself with the registration and deposit process of a chosen platform. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Select a Platform &#8211; </strong>First, choose a reputable platform to play Plinko. It&#8217;s important to consider which platform works in your region, any welcome bonuses, and the supported payment methods.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Register &#8211; </strong>Afterward, complete the registration process for the platform. While some gambling sites will require KYC, other, crypto-centric platforms, will support anonymous gambling. </li>
<li><strong>Step 3: Deposit </strong>&#8211; Once you&#8217;ve created an account, it&#8217;s time to deposit. Check out the platform&#8217;s supported payment methods, select one that works for you, and complete the deposit. </li>
<li><strong>Step 4: Play Plinko Online &#8211; </strong>After funding the account, it&#8217;s time to play Plinko online. Simply search for &#8216;Plinko&#8217; choose the most appealing option, and start playing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plinko Bitcoin Bonuses</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to think that every bonus is the same, there are a few different types. </p>
<h3>Matched Bonus</h3>
<p>A matched bonus will award the user with extra crypto for completing a deposit. Typically, between 100% to 150%. However, these bonuses are paid out incrementally to prevent users from simply pocketing the bonus and not playing. BC.Game offers a 270% bonus, while CloudBet will match a deposit by 100%. </p>
<h3>Free Spins</h3>
<p>Another common type of Bitcoin bonus is free spins. Sometimes, rather than providing extra credit, a platform will prove free spins on a certain game. As an example, Winz.io offers between 100 and 300 free spins as a bonus to first-time depositors.  </p>
<h3>No-Deposit Bonuses</h3>
<p>While slightly more rare, some platforms also offer no-deposit bonuses. These rewards can vary greatly from platform to platform but commonly include loyalty programs, an example being mBit.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the Best Cheap Cryptocurrencies </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve taken a brief look at some of the lowest price crypto coins that could grow exponentially over the coming months, it&#8217;s time we take a deeper look at the inner workings of each.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong>Overall Best Cheap Crypto <strong>With </strong><strong>Over 500% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Up To 25% Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is a new token presale built around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The token presale runs in 10 stages where each stage will have a higher token price than the previous stage. This makes it prudent to buy as early as possible if you&#8217;re planning to participate in the token presale.</p>
<p>For example, in the first stage, you can buy $BTCETF tokens for $0.0050, which goes up to $0.0068 in the last stage. That&#8217;s a 36% difference in price. Despite that, this is still the cheap compared to many other crypto tokens.</p>
<p>Participate in the $BTCETF token presale by connecting your Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, to the token presale site and use ETH, USDT or card to make the purchase. You can buy $BTCETF tokens with MATIC and BNB, but this isn&#8217;t recommended as you won&#8217;t be eligible for the staking APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="461" class="alignnone wp-image-130203 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Being built around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval process, the token benefits every time a milestone around the ETF approval is reached, such as the approval itself, the launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF and having $1 billion in assets under management. With each milestone, the team will burn 5% of the total supply until 25% of the entire token supply is removed from circulation.</p>
<p>Another rewarding feature is the staking, which has 500% APY at the moment. This number will drop, of course. The more tokens are bought and staked, the lower the APY will go. If you buy the presale, make sure to stake as soon as possible to take advantage of the high APY early on.</p>

<h3>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; A Crypto Token With a Unique Bitcoin Stake-To-Mine Model For Passive Earnings</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix</u></a> is an emerging cheap crypto that has caught investor attention due to its next-gen eco-friendly approach to Bitcoin cloud mining.</p>
<p>Within just two weeks post-launch, the platform secured over $1 million showing its promising upside potential and the surging interest from the investor community.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/333124/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The native $BTCMTX token&#8217;s initial price is $0.011, projected to climb to $0.0129 by the 20th and final presale phase. The total token supply is 4 billion, with notable mining, staking, and community initiatives allocations.</p>
<p>At the heart of Bitcoin Minetrix is its innovative &#8220;Stake-to-Mine&#8221; model. Traditional Bitcoin mining has long been criticized for its environmental footprint. </p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix addresses this concern by offering an eco-friendly solution that differs from energy-intensive practices. </p>
<p>Users stake the platform&#8217;s native token, $BTCMTX, to receive non-tradable mining credits. These credits, once burnt, offer users Bitcoin mining power, a method that refines and simplifies the entire mining process, mitigating risks associated with conventional cash contracts that dominate older mining models.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</u></a>, the project has set a clear roadmap for its financial aspirations. With a hard cap target of $32 million, they intend to channel these funds towards platform growth and reinvestment.</p>
<p>Prioritizing user experience, Bitcoin Minetrix offers an integrated dashboard with a comprehensive overview of their mining activities.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/333126/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-.jpg" alt="BTCMTX stake-to-mine BTC" /></figure>
<p>From insight into hashing power and mining credit earnings to projections on daily, weekly, and monthly rewards, all essential data is available at a glance. Plus, mobile compatibility allows users to monitor and engage in Bitcoin mining on the move seamlessly.</p>
<p>Currently offering an impressive APY exceeding 700%, the platform is a high-yield prospect, particularly in bearish times. The initial two weeks saw over 55 million tokens staked, highlighting strong community confidence.</p>
<p>The platform’s token also underwent an audit by Coinsult to reinforce trust. The platform’s presale website accepts ETH, BNB, and USDT payments. </p>
<p>You can enter the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram channel</u></a> to stay updated with the latest developments and announcements.</p>

<h3>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Exciting Meme and Play-to-Earn Coin Available on Presale</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is an exciting new cheap meme coin to buy that is currently enjoying a successful presale, with more than $500k raised so far.</p>
<p>However, the project doesn&#8217;t follow the usual meme coin template and has huge utility that could see it make huge strides in the coming months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/333571/meme-kombat.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" /></figure>
<p>During the presale, buyers can immediately decide to stake tokens and earn an annual percentage yield of 112% for as long as it lasts.</p>
<p>Its bigger utility is the play-to-earn Battle Arena, where players can wager on the outcome of battles between characters that represent popular meme coins such as Pepe, Wojak, Floki and Milady.</p>
<p>The battles are underpinned by artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, with all results immutable, transparent, and fair, with winnings paid out immediately to the winners.</p>
<p>Players not only wager on the outcome of battles but there are also a variety of side markets to engage in, adding extra elements of strategy and intrigue to the game.</p>

<h3>6. XRP &#8211; Transactional Cryptocurrency for International Transfers and Currency Conversion</h3>
<p>Created in 2012 by David Schwartz, XRP is a transactional cryptocurrency specializing in international money transfers and currency conversions.</p>
<p> The project is currently in the midst of a lawsuit with the securities and exchange commission  (SEC) which has kept the price low. However, the token has recently been seeing some impressive growth as the conclusion of the suit edges closer. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226074/xrp-site.jpg" alt="Ripple home page" /></figure>
<p>While its use as a transactional cryptocurrency is the reason XRP is commonly considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> on the market, in 2021, XRP launched the XRP Ledger (XRPL) allowing people to build decentralized applications on the network, similar to the Ethereum network. This massively broadened XRP&#8217;s use case, boosting its utility significantly.  </p>
<p>All in all, XRP is perhaps the best cheap crypto to buy for investors that prefer blue-chip crypto projects. Its price has been held down due to its dealings with the SEC, however, with things seemingly getting closer to a resolution, the price of XRP has the potential to explode. As such, the transactional low price cryptocurrency is worthy of consideration. </p>
<h3>7. Chainlink &#8211; Crypto Project Implementing Off-Chain Data into On-Chain Applications</h3>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is a cryptocurrency project specializing in implementing off-chain data sources into on-chain applications. The project has been thriving since its release due to Chainlink offering an important service that massively expanded the potential use cases for blockchain-powered applications. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226076/chainlink-site.jpg" alt="chainlink website" /></figure>
<p>One of the main reasons why LINK is often touted as being one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos to buy</a> is its extensive list of partnerships. As the project was one of the first in its sector, it has enjoyed a first-mover advantage which helped Chainlihnk to become a key player in the crypto space. Some of the project&#8217;s partnerships include Aave and data providers like Brave New Coin. </p>
<p>Few of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in can rival Chainlink when it comes to utility and partnerships. As such, the project seems poised to continue dominating the off-chain data implementation market. The LINK token remained fairly strong throughout 2022&#8217;s market-wide downtrend, highlighting the strength of Chainlink.</p>
<h3>8. Terra Classic &#8211; Trending Low-Cost Crypto Growing Quickly</h3>
<p>Following the collapse of Terra Luna and the UST stablecoin, holders of LUNA voted to create a new blockchain called Luna 2, with the original Luna being renamed to Luna Classic (LUNC). While the project lost investor confidence during the collapse of UST, the LUNC token has been performing surprisingly well in recent months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226080/terra-site-2.jpg" alt="terra home page" /></figure>
<p>Although Luna dropped by over 99% after trillions of tokens were minted as the project&#8217;s algorithm attempted to build collateral in an attempt to re-peg UST with the dollar, the LUNC token has since risen in value by over 200%, making it one of the best-performing assets of the past few months. </p>
<p>Some investors aim to push a proposal that will have an additional 500 million LUNC tokens minted in order to facilitate the creation of a new stablecoin. However, it seems unlikely that investors will forget about the issues plaguing UST anytime soon. Nevertheless, LUNCH remains perhaps the best cheap crypto to invest in. </p>
<h3>9. Stellar &#8211; Cheap Crypto with Fast Settlement and Low Fees</h3>
<p>Stellar (XLM) is a transactional cryptocurrency similar to XRP. In fact, Stellar was initially created after one of XRP&#8217;s founders, Jeb McCaleb, forked the XRP network after disagreements arose surrounding the future direction of the project. Since then, Staller has grown significantly and remains consistently within the ranks of the 30 largest crypto assets. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226079/stellar-site.jpg" alt="Stellar website" /></figure>
<p>The Stellar network specializes in fast settlement for the lowest possible cost. As such, it has gained favor with payment providers like MoneyGram. Stellar has done well to build a reputation as a solid alternative to XRP. As such, it seems likely that the project will have a place within the blockchain-powered financial industry of the future. </p>
<p>Stellar is a solid project that has the potential to perform extremely well if it&#8217;s able to partner with a few key financial institutions. While the token has thus far struggled to provide investors with substantial gains, it briefly exploded in both 2018 and 2021, meaning it&#8217;s likely that history could repeat itself. With that in mind, Stellar is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-under-1-dollar.htm">best cryptos under 1 dollar</a> right now.</p>
<h3>10. Dogecoin &#8211; The Orginal Meme Coin Favored by Elon Musk</h3>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) is a popular meme coin that was popularized by Elon Musk during the fabled 2021 bull run. Despite originally being created in 2013 as a joke, the project has since become a valid cryptocurrency project that frequently sits within the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226078/doge-site.jpg" alt="Dogecoin home page" /></figure>
<p>As a fork of Litecoin, which itself is a fork of Bitcoin, Dogecoin benefits from strong fundamentals, good security, and ample decentralization. Similar to Bitcoin, the Dogecoin network uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to validate transactions. However, the supply of DOGE is uncapped, meaning the token is inflationary. </p>
<p>While Dogecoin may have initially been created as a joke, it has since become a force to be reckoned with in the crypto market. Due to the token increasing in value by over 16,000% within just 5 months during 2021, some speculators anticipate DOGE to explode during the next bull run, as such, the project is worthy of consideration for investors looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">best future cryptocurrency</a> project.</p>
<h3>11. Decentraland &#8211; The Largest Customizable Metaverse World</h3>
<p>Next on our list of the best cheap crypto to buy is Decentraland (MANA). While many low price cryptos lack mainstream appeal, Decentraland has become one of the most widely known cryptocurrency projects as a result of the recent Metaverse boom. This has enabled the project to attract thousands of investors and cement itself as one of the go-to Metaverse worlds. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226082/decentraland-site.jpg" alt="Decentraland metaverse project" /></figure>
<p>Decentraland allows people to create imaginative buildings on parcels of NFT-based land using a series of in-build tools specialling tailored to creators. It&#8217;s possible to create a huge variety of projects within the Decentraland world, with some ingenious users building office spaces, play-to-earn experiences, and NFT museums. </p>
<p>The project was a smash hit in late 2021 and with the Metaverse only growing in prevalence, it seems likely for the MANA token to increase in value alongside it. With Decentraland at the forefront of the Metaverse trend, MANA is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm">15 best Metaverse coins</a> currently available. </p>
<h3>12. Chiliz &#8211; Cryptocurrency Project Facilitating the Creation of Sports Fan Tokens</h3>
<p>Chiliz (CHZ) is a powerful project focused on facilitating the creation of fan tokens to be used within the Sociois ecosystem. The project has done well to build up a plethora of partnerships with sports teams over the past few years, which has helped Chiliz to attract mainstream attention.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226077/chiliz-website-2.jpg" alt="Chiliz provider for sports and entertainment" /></figure>
<p>Chiliz allows sports teams to create cryptocurrency tokens designed to boost engagement with fans. While each fan token has different uses, they commonly allow people to vote on various decisions relating to sports teams such as the design of the team&#8217;s bus or which motivational message gets said to a team prior to a large game. </p>
<p>For Investors trying to locate the cheapest crypto to invest in, CHZ is a solid choice. With the World Cup slated to begin soon, it&#8217;s likely that Chiliz will enjoy a reasonable boost in demand which could send the token soaring. As such, it could be worth checking out Chiliz in order to get exposure to one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long term crypto</a> projects.</p>
<h3>13. Filecoin &#8211; Cryptocurrency Utilizing Blockchain Technology to Reshape Data Storage</h3>
<p>Out of all the lowest price crypto coins that we&#8217;ve discussed, Filecoin (FIL) is one of the most intriguing. The project aims to revolutionize the way data is stored by creating a decentralized platform that pairs those needing storage with people owning extra needed storage devices. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89954/226083/filecoin-site.jpg" alt="Filecoin crypto project" /></figure>
<p>This system promises to reshape the way important information is stored by eliminating the issues that arise from centralized cloud storage solutions. The FIL token is used to incentivize storage providers and miners that validate transactions on the network. Filecoin is one of the few low price cryptocurrency projects focused on improving data storage, and as such, could perform well. </p>
<p>While Filecoin might not be the cheapest crypto to buy on our list, considering the intrinsic value offered by the project, it&#8217;s well deserving of its valuation. As more companies look toward decentralized solutions for data storage, we could see Filecoin become far more mainstream which would cause the FIL token to grow exponentially. </p>
<h2>How to Find the Cheapest Cryptos with Potential</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When it comes to finding the best cheap crypto to invest in, there is a wide range of techniques that can be employed to streamline the process. </p>
<p>To help ensure that new investors have all the tools required to find the best cheap crypto to buy, we&#8217;ve revealed a few of our favorite techniques. </p>
<p>Perhaps the fastest way to find the lowest price crypto coins worth investing in is to have a careful look at platforms like CoinMarketCap which aggregate cryptocurrencies based on market cap (or various other factors). It&#8217;s a good idea to look for a project that has fallen significantly from its highs and seems to be holding well at a certain level. </p>
<p>Another great technique that can be used to search for the cheapest crypto to invest in is browsing social media. It&#8217;s common for a project to tease large updates on platforms like Twitter and Telegram prior to release. This can provide investors with crucial information that be used to decide whether is project is valued lower than it should be. </p>
<p>Lastly, investing in a project before the masses is a great way to profit from a low price cryptocurrency. Searching for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> can help an investor to find early-stage projects that haven&#8217;t yet been picked up on by the masses. With that said, it&#8217;s important to carefully consider whether a low price cryptocurrency project is actually worth investing in prior to committing to a purchase. </p>
<h2>Deciding Whether Cheap Cryptocurrency is a Good Investment</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While hunting for the best cheap crypto to buy is all well and good, it&#8217;s crucial to perform the proper due diligence when it comes to deciding whether cheap crypto is a good investment. Below, we&#8217;ve shared a few ways people can determine whether an asset has any merit as an investment.</p>
<h3>Intrinsic Value</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to determine whether low-price crypto is worth investing in is to inspect its utility. A project that boats great utility and has plenty of intrinsic value will perform far better during market decline than an asset that&#8217;s valued solely for its hype or use as an investment. </p>
<h3>Innovation</h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s crucial for a project to have ample utility, it&#8217;s equally as important for it to be innovative. If there&#8217;s a well-established player in a certain sector, it will be far harder for a new project to gain market share. However, if a cryptocurrency is innovative and solves a problem before any other project, it will have a much greater chance of performing well as an investment. </p>
<h3>Tokenomics</h3>
<p>One of the core driving forces behind the value of any asset is supply and demand. If demand outpaces supply, an asset will rise in value. Conversely, if an asset has more supply than demand, it will decrease in price. As such, taking a look at a project&#8217;s tokenomics is crucial to understanding whether it&#8217;ll be a good investment. Typically, projects with a low supply will gain value faster. </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>As the team behind a project is in charge of shaping it into the best version of itself, researching the people behind the project is a big help when it comes to finding the cheapest cryptocurrency to invest in. If a project has a strong, doxed team with a track record of delivering on promises, the project will have a far greater chance at success compared to those without a good team. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ve taken a look at the lowest price cryptocurrencies, discussed how to find the best cheap crypto to invest in, and explained the process of determining whether a certain asset has merit as an investment. During our research, one project offered the most upside potential for the lowest price.</p>
<p>One of the best cheap cryptocurrency assets to invest in 2023 is Bitcoin ETF Token. Bitcoin ETF Token is a speculative token based on events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. It has already raised around $500,000 within the first week of the presale and is now in stage two with a token price of $0.0052.</p>

<h2>A Closer Look at Our Top 10 Crypto Tips</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In order to assist our readers in the best way possible, we&#8217;ve opted to add cryptocurrency tips that span a wide range of areas, including trading, understanding the market, and reducing risk. While each tip is solid on its own, together they&#8217;re even more powerful. As such, it&#8217;s worth carefully reading through each tip in order to get the most value possible. </p>
<h3>1. Join a Reliable Crypto Group &#8211; Find Like-Minded Individuals and Learn from Experienced Traders</h3>
<p>One of the fastest, easiest, and most effective ways an investor can expand their trading knowledge is by joining a reliable crypto group. An example of such a group is the <a href="https://discord.gg/fgCbjW9BzJ">Jacob Crypto Bury Discord</a> server. The server is updated constantly, with Bury tutoring both experienced and amateur traders alike, providing immeasurable value. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222887/jacob-bury-discord-video.jpg" alt="jacob bury discord" /></figure>
<p>While it can be incredibly difficult to filter through all the information available online to find crypto trade tips, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-discord-groups.htm">best Discord crypto groups</a> and Telegram channels often provide a myriad of information concentrated on a single platform. This can be a huge help when it comes to learning the ins and outs of crypto trading as it prevents confusion arising from conflicting information. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the community aspect of crypto groups can make trading both more teachable and fun. A budding trader will have an easy way to find an answer to an otherwise obscure question and they&#8217;re also able to interact with like-minded people, helping to boost consistency and reinforce positive trading habits. </p>
<p>The Jacob Crypto Bury Discord group features a plethora of resources including a channel for friendly crypto-related discussions, a channel to promote altcoins with huge potential, and even a dedicated tutorial channel. As such, it&#8217;s an excellent platform for both traders and investors regardless of their experience within the market.</p>
<p>Another phenomenal platform run by Jacob Bury is the <a href="https://t.me/b2cgroupofficial">B2C Crypto Calls &amp; News Telegram channel</a>. With over 1,700 subscribers, it&#8217;s clear the group is a treasure trove of information. It features key information about hot new cryptocurrencies as well as analytical pieces and crypto news, the B2C Telegram is a great tool for budding traders. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222888/b2c-telegram-group.jpg" alt="B2C crypto calls and news telegram" /></figure>
<p>All in all, Telegram and Discord trading groups can be invaluable resources. Additionally, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-tiktok-accounts.htm">best crypto TikTok accounts</a> and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-youtube-channels.htm">best crypto YouTube channels</a> also offer insights into the best upcoming crypto projects. The only drawback is that many lack substantial, actionable information. </p>
<p>However, both the Discord and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-telegram-groups.htm">best crypto Telegram groups</a> we&#8217;ve taken a look at are excellent resources that should not be overlooked by anyone looking to expand their trading and investing knowledge. </p>

<h3>2. Look for Early Crypto Presales &#8211; Maximize Returns by Investing Prior to CEX Listings</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to profit in the cryptocurrency space is to get in early on a hyped project or the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-deflationary-cryptocurrency.htm">best deflationary cryptos</a>. Typically, price is driven primarily by demand. As such, investing in a project before it becomes widely known and mainstream is one of the top tips for crypto. </p>
<p>This is where the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"> best crypto presales</a> come into the picture. By carefully researching upcoming or early-stage presales, an investor can determine which projects have ample utility and are likely to explode. </p>
<p>A few things that are important to look out for when working out which crypto presales are likely to perform well and increase in value once on the open market include utility, a doxed team, and community.</p>
<p>The only drawback to investing in crypto presales is that actually finding them can be rather time-consuming. However, this burden can be lessened easily. </p>
<p>Linking to our previous crypto trading tip, joining a crypto group like the Jacob Bury Discord or the B2C Telegram can make it easy to find new presales as well as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">best crypto ICOs</a>. </p>
<p>Both groups spoke about TAMA and IBAT well before they announced exchange listings and with the team&#8217;s behind each contently researching, the next big presale could be announced at any time.</p>
<p>Currently, the group has outlined three projects with immense upside potential &#8211; Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix and Wall Street Memes. </p>
<h4><strong>Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong>New Crypto Presale <strong>With </strong><strong>Over 2,000% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Up To 25% Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is an Ethereum-based token built around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval process by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With each milestone around the approval event, the team will burn 5% of the total token supply. Moreover, you can earn a generous APY by staking your tokens while you wait for the ETF approval.</p>
<p>Buy $BTCETF tokens by connecting your MetaMask wallet to the Bitcoin ETF Token site. Use ETH, USDT or card to complete the transaction. You can buy $BTCETF tokens with MATIC and BNB as well, but you won&#8217;t be eligible for the staking feature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="463" class="alignnone wp-image-128538 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token-768x395.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The token presale will run in 10 stages where the price increases with each stage, starting from $0.0050 in the first stage and all the way up to $0.0068 in the last stage. This makes buying as early as possible the most potentially rewarding option.</p>
<p>Regardless in which stage you buy, however, you can maximize your rewards with the staking feature where you can earn 2,000% at the moment. Note, this number will drop as more tokens get staked.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="348" class="alignnone wp-image-128560 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking.jpg" alt="BTCETF token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking-300x116.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699443007-btcetf-staking-768x297.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The team will employ a token burning process where 5% of the total token supply will be burned as each milestone around the Bitcoin spot ETF approval is reached. These milestones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$BTCETF token reaches $100 million trading volume.</li>
<li>The first Bitcoin ETF is approved.</li>
<li>The first Bitcoin ETF is launched.</li>
<li>The total assets under management for all Bitcoin ETFs reaches $1 billion in value.</li>
<li>Bitcoin reaches a price of over $100,000.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; New Presale With Stake-To-Mine Bitcoin Mechanics</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</u></a> is a Bitcoin cloud mining operation that is proving to be enormously popular among investors. It has raised nearly $600,000 in a little over a week, and offers APY of 1,106%, at the present time. This new campaign offers a way into Bitcoin cloud mining that is easy, low-cost and simple.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/332895/screen-shot-2023-10-06-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>No other platform offers the stake-to-mine ecosystem put forward by Bitcoin Minetrix. Using this model users stake their BTCMTC tokens in return for non-transferrable cloud mining credits. These credits are then burned in return for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>All of this takes place through a simple interface. Because the tokens are non-transferrable, owners retain complete control. All that is required is a Web3 wallet to connect to the presale page, and a mobile application is also under development for enhanced convenience.</p>
<p>This is not the case with existing solutions. In fact, the Bitcoin cloud mining industry is known to be unsafe, with high investment costs and changing terms and conditions. With Bitcoin Minetrix, the cot is a mere $10 and users have control. They can decide how much to burn, withdraw, or stake. This campaign has also scored very well in its third party <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf"><u>smart contract audit</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/332894/screen-shot-2023-10-05-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix stake to mine dashboard" /></figure>
<p>There are a total of 4 billion BTCMTX tokens, with 2.8 billion (70%) allocated to the presale. The token retails at  $0.011, though it goes up at each stage of the 10-stage presale, before finalizing at $0.0119. In terms of both yields and price, it makes more sense to invest sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The presale is targeting a multi billion dollar industry and provides a utility-based alternative to existing solutions. It is the world’s first stake-to-mine initiative, and could be a great addition a crypto portfolio in 2023.</p>

<h4><br /><strong>Wall Street Memes: Community-Backed Meme Token That Raised Over $25 Million In Presale, Now Listed On OKX</strong></h4>
<p>Wall St Bulls, originally known for its Ethereum NFT collection, has entered the meme coin market with its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street memes</u></a> (WSM) token. </p>
<p>With a combined social media following of over one million across platforms like Twitter and Instagram, the project leverages an established community as it expands into the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Launched in May 2023, the $WSM token is now live on OKX and other T1 exchanges. It can also be purchased OTC via the official website. It is performing extremely well on exchanges, as it did during its massive presale with a $25 million raise. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90529/329656/screenshot-2023-09-12-at-.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token presale page" /></figure>
<p>According to the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes whitepaper</u></a>, WSM’s total token supply is 2 billion, entirely community-allocated. </p>
<p>Half of this supply is reserved for the presale, while the remainder is distributed between community rewards and liquidity pools. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is no team allocation, highlighting the project&#8217;s community-driven nature. Investors can also generate passive income through staking, with an estimated APY of over 50% at the time of writing.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90529/329657/screenshot-2023-09-12-at-.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token staking" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, Wall Street Memes has caught the attention of high-profile individuals like Elon Musk, who interacted with WSM on X (previously Twitter). </p>
<p>Its strong digital footprint makes it a probable candidate for listings on major exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<p>Also, to celebrate the presale, a $50,000 airdrop is planned. Participants can join the Wall Street Memes Discord and follow its various social media platforms for a chance to win a share.</p>
<p>You can enter the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Wall Street Memes Telegram channel</u></a> for the latest news.</p>

<h3>3. Join a Crypto Signals Group &#8211; Save Time and Get Great Trade Setups </h3>
<p>While joining a crypto Discord server or Telegram channel is an excellent way to learn about cryptocurrency and find exciting new projects, joining a dedicated crypto signals group like <a href="https://cryptosignals.org/?ref=business2community">CryptoSignals.org</a> is perhaps the best way one can improve their skills as a trader. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222892/crypto-signals-site.jpg" alt="cryptosignals website" /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">best crypto signals</a> groups often yield impressive returns for users as they tend to be created by or contain extremely knowledgeable traders that constantly monitor the charts for potential setups. As not everyone has the time required to watch charts all day, these groups offer a simple way to get access to top setups without dealing with the boring stuff. </p>
<p>The CryptoSignals platform provides roughly 2-3 carefully curated signals every single day, meaning that there will always be ample opportunity to profit from the group. Furthermore, with an 82% success ratio, the group has already provided its users with a plethora of actionable trades that yielded some great returns. </p>
<p>Overall, while not everyone is able to dedicate the time to watch a multitude of charts in order to find interesting setups, joining a crypto signals group can prove immediate access to the best trades without requiring lengthy research. As such, these groups are perfect for those learning or trading alongside a full or part-time job. </p>

<h3>4. Try Copy Trading &#8211; Automatically Mirror the Trades of Other Users to Trade Automatically</h3>
<p>Copy trading is sometimes referred to as social trading and involves mirroring the traders of another user in order to earn a profit. Typically, a copy trading platform will allow users to automatically copy the trades another user executes will customizing factors like trade size. This concept has been a huge hit, with global brokers like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">eToro</a> implementing it directly into their platforms. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222893/etoro-copytraders.jpg" alt="etoro copytrading" /></figure>
<p>One of the best crypto trade tips out there is to use copy trading to your advantage. Over the past few years, copy trading has risen in prevalence massively as an increasing number of people have been looking toward methods for streaming the trading experience. </p>
<p>Out of all the copy trading platforms on the market, eToro is perhaps the best. The broker allows users to search for traders and view their win rate on trades. This gives the user far more control over their trades while incentivizing those registered as copy traders to only engage in solid trades to avoid negatively impacting their ratings. </p>
<p>While copy trading does, of course, help users to earn a profit from crypto with minimal effort, that&#8217;s not all. People learning to trade can use copy trading platforms to learn which strategies work without spending large sums testing . This is a huge help for new traders to anyone simply attempting to minimize risk. Therefore, it&#8217;s worth trying copy trading to see how it works. </p>

<h3>5. Practice Trading on a Demo Account &#8211; Learn the Ins and Outs of Trading while Conserving Funds</h3>
<p>Learning to trade can be difficult and costly. Many beginner traders are afraid to get started for fear of losing money and understandably so. It&#8217;s almost guaranteed that someone new to trading will make a few bad calls. However, this doesn&#8217;t have to be the end of the world. By utilizing demo accounts, people are free to practice without the worry of losing their funds. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222894/etoro-demo-account.jpg" alt="etoro demo account" /></figure>
<p>There is no shortage of brokers that offer a demo account for users, however, surprisingly few traders actually make use of them. While it can be easy to get caught up on the idea of making money, conserving funds is just as important (more on that later). As such, demo accounts are invaluable tools that are worth considering. </p>
<p>While some might think that practice accounts are only for beginners, that couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth. Even experienced traders need to test out new strategies before fully deploying them and demo accounts make for the perfect testing grounds. </p>
<p>Although it can be tempting to jump straight into the world of crypto trading, it&#8217;s rarely the right call. It&#8217;s a far better idea to take heed of some of our crypto day trading tips and practice using a demo account prior to parting with real money. </p>

<h3>6. Learn About the Wider Economy &#8211; Understand What Drives the Market to Benefit Decision Making</h3>
<p>Regardless of what some die-hard crypto fanatics might have beginners think, cryptocurrency is a financial market like any other. As such, learning about how the economy works and what causes markets to move can be immensely valuable. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222896/inflation.jpg" alt="inflation chart" /></figure>
<p>While there is an uncountable number of factors that influence the cryptocurrency market, some have more impact than others. For example, it&#8217;s crucial for a trader to understand the effects of inflation as it has a large impact on consumer spending and the value of base currencies like the dollar. </p>
<p>Learning about factors that affect the wider economy as well as other financial markets is key to truly understanding what drives the value of cryptocurrency. Furthermore, it has the added bonus of improving a trader&#8217;s financial literacy helping them to make better-informed decisions regarding things like saving as well as trading and investing. </p>

<h3>7. Understand the Technology &#8211; Crucial to Appreciating the Merits of Cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>At its core, cryptocurrency is a piece of technology. However, far too few people actually understand what cryptocurrency is, how it works, and what makes a specific project good and instead view the asset class as nothing but an investment vehicle. It goes without saying, lacking knowledge on the aforementioned topics can lead traders to make poor decisions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222895/blockchain.jpg" alt="blockchain schematics" /></figure>
<p>In order to avoid any unfortunate incidents that may arise from a lack of knowledge on the technology that powers crypto, it&#8217;s worth brushing up on topics like distributed ledgers, what a blockchain is, how transactions are validated, consensus mechanisms (e.g. proof of work, proof of stake, etc) and how smart contracts work.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s true that cryptocurrency is a complex topic with a lot of moving parts, understanding even the basics outside of its merits as an investment can put a trader or investor on the path to success. There is a plethora of crypto educational resources out there so it&#8217;s worth taking the time to research in order to unlock new opportunities within the space.</p>
<h3>8. Risk Management &#8211; Knowing How to Conserve Funds is Equally as Important as Making Profit</h3>
<p>As we briefly touched on earlier, understanding risk management is equally as important as understanding how to find the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a>. Again, risk management can be a complex topic but being aware of the basic concept can help take a person&#8217;s trading prowess to new heights. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222900/risk-managment.jpg" alt="risk management sign" /></figure>
<p>Understanding risk vs reward is one of our favorite tips for crypto. Every position has a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">potential upside</a> and downside. As a trader, it&#8217;s important to ensure that a position has ample risk vs reward. A common measure is a 2:1 ratio in favor of reward (e.g. earn $10 while risking $5). Other important risk management concepts include diversification and trading within a budget.</p>
<p>While making a profit is perhaps the most fun aspect of trading, minimizing losses is what helps to make a trader great. To enjoy continued, long-term success the concept of risk management is crucial to understand and should never be overlooked.  </p>
<h3>9. Utilize Trading Bots &#8211; Automate Trading Strategy using Robots</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency and robots are two of the most exciting technologies in the modern world. As such, combining both makes for an interesting proposition. Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm">best crypto apps</a> will allow people to create robots that trade automatically and adhere to a specific buying and selling strategy, effectively allowing people to trade autonomously. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222897/kucoin-trading-bots.jpg" alt="kucoin trading bot" /></figure>
<p>With this in mind, one of our top crypto tips is to utilize the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best crypto trading bots</a> in order to create passive income streams. Many popular exchanges allow users to create their own bots using predetermined strategies like grid trading, meaning it can be surprisingly simple to get started. </p>
<p>While it&#8217;s important to be aware that successfully using a crypto bot will require an already tried and tested profitable trading strategy, once set up they require minimal maintenance(unless something affects the strategy). Therefore, learning how to use crypto bots is one of the best crypto trading tips for making life that little bit easier.</p>
<h3>10. Create and Stick to a Strategy &#8211; Following a Specific Strategy is Important for Long-Term Growth</h3>
<p>Next on our list of the best crypto tips is sticking to a strategy. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), alongside the fear of missing out (FOMO) are two of the most common factors that can influence a trader into making poor decisions. However, following a predetermined strategy can help to eliminate these issues.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88685/222898/strategy.jpg" alt="stratagy spelled in tiles" /></figure>
<p>Having an open position can be rather stressful. Nobody wants to see their funds evaporate due to unforeseen circumstances, but it&#8217;s crucial to not act rashly. Creating and adhering to a trading strategy is crucial to safely trading and bolstering long-term portfolio growth. While it&#8217;s important to make sure a certain strategy is actually working, sticking to can improve a person&#8217;s trading tenfold. </p>
<p>Not everyone will trade in the same way so one of our most important cryptocurrency trading tips is to find a strategy that works and stick to it. This goes hand in hand with minimizing risk and can often make a far larger difference than most people anticipate. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222512/jacob-bury-lunc.jpg" alt="jacob bury lunc profits" /></figure>
<p>While there are far too many lackluster crypto Discord servers designed to generate funds for its owner rather than its users, the Jacob Crypto Bury server, which has over 12k members, is certainly not one of them. Jacob Bury himself is an invaluable source of knowledge and frequently speaks with the community to inform people about the latest updates and any potential investments/trades. </p>
<p>A strong community spirit isn&#8217;t the only thing that makes the Jacob Bury group one of the best Discord crypto servers. In order to best assist beginners, the server is packed to the brim with useful video tutorials as well as the latest news from the cryptocurrency world. This offers a hugely valuable glimpse into the inner workings of the market and absolutely shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked. </p>
<p>While the Jacob Crypto Bury server offers a huge amount of support to people learning to trade and trying to decipher the ins and outs of the market, it&#8217;s also a great tool for investors. Jacob Bury has often spotted hot new projects before they become common knowledge to the market. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222513/jacob-bury-gains.jpg" alt="jacob bury member profits" /></figure>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2. Reddit CryptoCurrency Discord &#8211; Community-Focused Crypto Server</strong></h3>
<p>Reddit is perhaps the social media most synonymous with cryptocurrency. A large percentage of crypto projects have a Reddit community of their own but the leading crypto-related community on the platform still remains r/CryptoCurrency. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222511/r-cryptocurrency-discord.jpg" alt="r/cryptocurrency market outlook" /></figure>
<p>With over 40,000 users, the r/CryptoCurrency Discord is one of the largest communities dedicated to crypto on the entire internet. It&#8217;s free to join and features a wide range of sub-groups, meaning that the server remains easy to navigate and straightforward to use. </p>
<p>The server features a section for just about every topic related to crypto. From assisting beginners with investing and learning basic trading techniques, to an area dedicated to reporting scams, and even one for technical analysis, the r/CryptoCurrency Discord helps to provide a comprehensive guide to trading, investing, and cryptocurrency in general. </p>
<p>Although some of the r/CryptoCurrency Discord topics are less populated than others, the server remains extremely active with users ready to jump in and help one another at a moment&#8217;s notice. As such, it&#8217;s an excellent platform for anyone trying to expand their knowledge and learn about new topics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222510/r-cryptocurrency-discord-charts.jpg" alt="r/cryptocurrency charts" /></p>
<p>While the server is unable to hold a candle to Jacob Bury&#8217;s when it comes to getting in early on projects primed to take off, it remains a rock solid free tool for anyone looking to get into the market. As such, it can safely be considered one of the best cryptocurrency Discord groups.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Mylol Crypto Community &#8211; Crypto Group with a Focus on Educating Investors</strong></h3>
<p>Investors looking for a crypto Discord server with a heavy focus on community will be right at home with Mylol Crypto Community. The group is far smaller than some of the others we&#8217;ve taken a look at with under 1,000 members. </p>
<p>However, don&#8217;t let its size deceive you, Mylol provides investors with a plethora of educational resources that few of even the largest Discord crypto servers offer.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222509/mylol-discord.jpg" alt="mylol crypto chat" /></figure>
<p>As expected from one of the top Discord cryptocurrency groups, Mylol features a good variety of rooms dedicated to trading. Members share due diligence and ideas for trade setups frequently, going as far as explaining the methodology behind certain positions for new users to learn from.  Users are also free to discuss various plays and request guidance from experienced analysts</p>
<p>On top of its resources to assist budding traders, the Mylol Crypto Community Discord also hosts a variety of lessons. These educational resources cover everything from basic terminology to market fundamentals like price action and chart patterns.  </p>
<p>While the majority of cryptocurrency Discord servers offer little in the way of personalized assistance, Mylol Crypto Community is an exception. For such a comparatively small server, it&#8217;s packed with information and staff that clearly care about the success of its users. </p>
<h3><strong>4. Cryptohub &#8211; Cryptocurrency Service Created with Beginners in Mind</strong></h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for the best Crypto Discord groups to offer paid plans for members, typically promising the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">best crypto signals</a>, Cryptohub is a 100% free platform that has been created with beginners in mind. </p>
<p>With over 30 different rooms dedicated to different topics, Cryptohub is truly a treasure trove of information.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222515/cryptohub-discord.jpg" alt="cryptohub trading tips" /></figure>
<p>Out of all the beginner-centric Discord crypto servers we&#8217;ve taken a look at, Cryptohub is one of the most compressive, an impressive feat for a 100% free platform. On the server, there are 10 detailed guides covering things like the basics of trading, the top wallets, and where to stake <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects. </p>
<p>On top of its plethora of educational resources, Cryptohub provides a section comprising more than 10 rooms solely dedicated to longer-term investments as well as lower cap projects with huge room for growth. These rooms are frequently updated by the server&#8217;s staff, ensuring that all information is relevant and up to date.</p>
<p>With so much information packed into a single, 100% free platform, Cryptohub is an invaluable source of educational material that shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked. While it lacks information on more specific topics like mining, DeFi, and NFTs, it&#8217;s a great starting point for any budding investor. </p>
<h3><strong>5. Satoshi&#8217;s Exchange &#8211; Analytics-Driven Discord Crypto Group</strong></h3>
<p>Satoshi&#8217;s Exchange is a crypto trading Discord group similar to others that we have discussed, however, it does differ in a few key areas. The group frequently discusses recently released news stories as well as new coin releases and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">best NFTs</a> on the market. </p>
<p>This ensures that members of Satoshi&#8217;s Exchange always have the latest information, which helps users to make good decisions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222516/satoshis-exchange-discord.jpg" alt="satoshis exchange calls and charts" /></figure>
<p>One reason why Satoshi&#8217;s Exchange can be included amongst the best crypto Discord groups is how comprehensive the platform is. By covering key area of areas of knowledge, Satoshi&#8217;s Exchange helps to educate its members on key topics, making overall better traders. Furthermore, there are a number of channels for users to speak to each other, ensuring that community spirit remains high. </p>
<p>As a crypto trading Discord group, Satoshi&#8217;s Exchange does frequently provide calls and trade setups. However, the majority of its signals are locked behind a paywall which is something to consider before joining. </p>
<p>For anyone trying to find a crypto trading Discord group, Satoshi&#8217;s exchange is a solid choice. It comes equipped with a huge range of information and its analytics-driven approach helps members understand exactly why a certain asset is worth buying or selling.</p>
<h3><strong>6. CryptoWzrd &#8211; Trading-Focused Discord for Crypto and Forex</strong></h3>
<p>CryptoWzrd is a highly respected figure in the trading community. He&#8217;s got hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram and Twitter and is commonly regarded as being a knowledge trader that puts a huge amount of effort in for his fans. </p>
<p>While the influencer distributes knowledge through socials, the CryptoWzrd Discord group is where in-depth analysis and scalps are shared.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222517/cryptowzrd-discord.jpg" alt="cryptowzrd crypto outlook" /></figure>
<p>Often touted as a great crypto trading Discord group, a massive variety of information is shared on the platform. It features both daily macro and short-term analysis on key assets like Bitcoin, and Ethereum, helping members to get an understanding of key driving forces behind the market. Providing further assistance, the group contains guides teaching both basic and advanced trading strategies.</p>
<p>The server also features long-form write-ups of key topics like inflation and monetary policy. Whenever an impactful event relating to the economy takes place, it&#8217;s spoken about in the group, ensuring that nobody is left in the dark. Furthermore, the CryptoWzrd group covers forex as well as cryptocurrency, adding to the server&#8217;s utility.</p>
<p>While the CryptoWzrd Discord cryptocurrency server offers a huge amount of information, its free resources are somewhat lacking and as such, we&#8217;re unable to place it any higher. </p>
<h3><strong>7. Filthy Rich Futures &#8211; Popular Group for Leveraged Trading</strong></h3>
<p>As the name implies, Filthy Rich Futures has a focus on short-term leveraged trading. The Crypto trading Discord group has over 15,000 members making use of its diverse set of resources. </p>
<p>In order to cater to those just dipping their toes in the water as well as more serious traders, the platform is free with paid membership providing access to higher value signals. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222518/filthy-rich-futures-discord.jpg" alt="filthy rich futures calls" /></figure>
<p>In order to ensure that a continuous flow of trades comes through, the server is separated by signal provider. Users are able to earn a slot under the signals channel, incentivizing users to contribute to the group. While Filthy Rich Futures cannot compare to a platform like the Jacob Crypto Bury Discord in terms of wider market knowledge, it remains a solid crypto trading Discord group.</p>
<p>Overall, Filthy Rich Futures is a solid platform for those looking to get into trading. While it lacks a bit when it comes to explaining the market, the quantity of calls helps to lessen this blow.</p>
<h3><strong>8. r/NFT Community Discord &#8211; Popular Reddit Sever Specializing in NFTs</strong></h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency covers a broad range of topics. While many of the best crypto Discord servers will contain information on a whole host of topics, for some investors, joining a group related to a specific class of crypto-asset can offer better guidance. </p>
<p>The r/NFT Discord is home to all things NFT-related. The server discusses both established and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/upcoming-nfts.htm">upcoming NFTs</a>, helping investors to find a solid project. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222519/r-nft-discord.jpg" alt="r/nft guides" /></figure>
<p>The server is broken into multiple topics, making it easy to find precisely what they&#8217;re looking for. Furthermore, the Discord features a number of community-centric rooms in which individuals can speak with one another. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the group has had a few issues recently but as a community-driven project, many people are working tirelessly to build the server back up to its former glory. With over 150,000 members, even the best cryptocurrency Discord groups would struggle to match the cumulative knowledge of the r/NFT Community Discord.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Axion &#8211; Trading and Investing Group with Strong Community</strong></h3>
<p>Axion is one of the best crypto Discord groups currently available. It features a broad range of guides and with 60,000 members, there&#8217;s always someone around to answer any pressing questions an investor might have. </p>
<p>This is crucial for any of the best crypto Discord groups as it allows</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/222520/axion-discord.jpg" alt="axion profits" /></figure>
<p>Within the Axion Discord cryptocurrency server, there is a large range of channels dedicated to helping users learn the basics of trading. In addition to a channel featuring beginner-centric information, there is a myriad of groups that allow users to receive and give advice, helping to bolster a strong community. </p>
<p>While Axion does feature paid membership options, the majority of beginner-centric information is available for free. Although Axion does provide plenty of useful information, it&#8217;s overshadowed by platforms like Jacob Bury&#8217;s Discord group which simply have far more resources to offer.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Rekt Capital &#8211; Leading Crypto Educator with high-quality newsletters and courses</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/rekt-capital/">Rekt Capital</a> is a leading crypto educator whose work has been published in an array of publications, including Forbes, Cointelegraph, and more. A crypto analyst, Rekt Capital is an expert and provides in-depth analysis of the cryptocurrency space, the sum of which has been concisely put inside his <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-courses.htm">educational resources</a> that you can buy and go through to get ready for crypto trading. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/270611/rekt-capital.jpg" alt="Rekt capital" /></figure>
<p>One of the most popular offerings by Rekt Capital is his newsletter, through which, he offers a unique, in-depth perspective on the hidden nuances of cryptocurrency investments. As one of the Top 4 Newsletters of Substack globally, the Rekt Capital newsletter has over 47000 subscribers. </p>
<p>That said, this crypto analyst that also runs one of the leading Crypto YouTube channels is yet to create a Discord account. The reason we have put his name on this list is that all signals indicate a new Discord channel might be coming soon by this crypto analyst.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/rekt-capital/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Rekt Capital</a>
<h2><strong>Why Follow Crypto Discord Groups?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There is a massive number of reasons why someone might want to follow the best crypto Discord groups, we&#8217;ve broken down a few of the most common. </p>
<h3><strong>Find Top New Coins</strong></h3>
<p>One of the top reasons why so many investors and traders flock to trading/investing servers is to find the hottest new projects before anyone else. </p>
<p>The people that run these groups have their fingers on the pulse of the crypto market, meaning they&#8217;re often the very first people to find out about projects packed with upside potential. </p>

<p>An example of a Discord cryptocurrency server that has consistently found excellent new coins for its users is the Jacob Crypto Bury group.</p>
<p>The popular influencer has shared a number of crypto gems with his audience &#8211; last year he found <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/">Tamadoge</a>, which had one of 2022&#8217;s top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">10 best crypto presales</a>, raising an impressive $19 million and then pumping by 1,900% after listing. This year he has discovered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($200k raised within a few days from launch), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($100k raised within hours of launch) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a> (Over $25 million raised in now-finished presale).  </p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin ETF Token</strong> &#8211; is an ERC20 token built to reward holders around market events like the Bitcoin spot ETF approval by the SEC. Once each milestone around the ETF approval is reached, such as the approval itself, the ETF launch, as well as when total assets under management in these ETFs reach over $1 billion, the team will burn 5% of the total token supply with each milestone.</p>
<p>You can buy the $BTCETF token in a presale that runs in 10 stages. Each stage comes with a slight increase in price, which makes it prudent to buy in early if you are going to buy the token presale anyway.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="463" class="alignnone wp-image-128538 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699441911-bitcoin-etf-token-768x395.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s a huge staking APY of 2,000% in the early stages. Keep in mind, this number will drop as more tokens get staked.</p>

<p><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix</strong> &#8211; Launched recently, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is a new crypto presale that offers a novel mechanism for Bitcoin cloud mining using Ethereum smart contracts. </p>
<p>It is the world’s first stake-to-mine ecosystem with an upfront investment of just $10. It also allows for easy mining management through a simple dashboard.</p>
<p>This opens up the closed Bitcoin mining market, which is very expensive and damaging to the environment. With Bitcoin Minetrix, tokens are staked in return for cloud mining credits. These are then burned in return for rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88501/332657/screen-shot-2023-10-04-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>There is a total of 2.8 billion tokens available in the presale, at a price of just $0.011. By the final stage, the price will have increased to $0.0119. </p>
<p>This campaign also offers a 1,500% APY at the present time.</p>

<p><strong>Wall Street Memes</strong> &#8211; In May 2023, Wall St Bulls, known for their Ethereum NFTs, launched Wall Street Memes ($WSM). The platform has a strong online community of over a million followers. </p>
<p>Their presale raised over $25 million and the token is live on OKX and other major exchanges. </p>
<p>According to their <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes">whitepaper</a>, $WSM has a 2 billion token cap, allocated as follows: 50% for presale, 30% community rewards, and 20% liquidity. Notably, no tokens are reserved for the team, emphasizing a community-first approach.</p>

<p>Staking in WSM offers over double digit APY at the current time. The project has millions of followers on social media. </p>

<h2>Analyzing The Most Undervalued Crypto Coins</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We&#8217;ve taken a quick look at each, so now it&#8217;s time we delve into our reviews of the most undervalued cryptocurrencies in 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong>Most Undervalued Crypto <strong>With </strong><strong>Over 500% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Up To 25% Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is the most undervalued crypto token with a huge potential if the spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On top of its speculative nature, the $BTCETF token offers a generous staking APY of 500% and it will burn up to 25% of the total token supply based on events around the ETF approval.</p>
<p>Buy $BTCETF tokens with ETH, USDT or card. All you need is to connect your MetaMask wallet to the token presale site to complete the purchase. If you own MATIC and BNB, you can also buy $BTCETF tokens in the presale, but you won&#8217;t be eligible for the staking APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="461" class="alignnone wp-image-130203 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Similar to many other presales, it may be best to buy as early as possible. That&#8217;s because the presale runs in 10 stages and each stage comes with a higher token price than the previous stage. $BTCETF tokens start at a price of $0.0050  per token and will go as high as $0.0068 in the final stage.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you buy in the later stages, though. You can still earn more tokens by staking them. At the moment of writing, the staking APY stands at 500%. This number will drop as more tokens are staked, which makes it prudent to stake as early in the presale as possible to take advantage of the high APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="350" class="alignnone wp-image-130369 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2.jpg" alt="BTCETF token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2-768x299.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The team will employ burn mechanics to lower the token supply by up to 25% in 5% increments when a certain milestone around the spot Bitcoin ETF is reached. The milestones include $BTCETF token reaches $100 million trading volume, the first Bitcoin ETF is approved and the first Bitcoin ETF is launched.</p>

<h3>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; A New Crypto With Tokenized Cloud Mining For Bitcoin, Raised $1 Million In Over Two Weeks</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix</u></a> is currently the most undervalued crypto, bridging the gap between traditional and modern mining methodologies. </p>
<p>In just over two weeks of its launch, it has secured nearly $1 million, showing its upside potential and the growing trust among the investor community.</p>
<p>This user-centric platform has a well-structured token supply of 4 billion, of which nearly 2.8 billion tokens are set aside for presale. </p>
<p>Beginning at $0.011, this rate is anticipated to rise to $0.0129 by the end of the 20th presale stage. </p>
<p>This token allocation is planned to benefit the community, with tokens reserved for mining and staking in addition to the marketing efforts.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/333398/screenshot-2023-10-11-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>Central to the Bitcoin Minetrix ecosystem is its &#8220;Stake-to-Mine&#8221; model. By staking the platform&#8217;s native $BTCMTX tokens, users are rewarded with non-tradable mining credits. </p>
<p>These credits, when burned, provide Bitcoin rewards, offering a simple and risk-mitigated mining experience. </p>
<p>This unique approach simplifies the mining process and presents a greener alternative, distancing itself from the environmental concerns associated with conventional mining.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</u></a>, beginner or experienced users can effortlessly monitor their mining activities through an intuitive dashboard. </p>
<p>This includes insights into hashing power, mining credit metrics, and potential revenue projections. With mobile compatibility, users can stay updated on their activities from anywhere, ensuring mining is both efficient and accessible.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/333399/screenshot-2023-10-11-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix stake-to-mine BTC" /></figure>
<p>By introducing a tokenized system, Bitcoin Minetrix offers tangible mining credits against staked tokens, bolstering user confidence and safeguarding against prevalent cloud mining scams. Notably, the flexibility of unstaking tokens per market rate further improves its user-friendly nature.</p>
<p>Having raised nearly $1 million within two weeks of its launch, Bitcoin Minetrix has set a hard cap goal of $33 million.</p>
<p>You can join the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram channel</u></a> to stay updated on the latest developments.</p>

<p>Wall Street Memes has the backing of over 1 million people across Twitter and Instagram. This popular meme platform was established in 2019 and released its own NFT project, Wall St Bulls. </p>
<p>During the first NFT drop in 2021, Wall St Bulls sold out 10,000 Ethereum-based NFTs in only 32 minutes. This goes to show the power of the Wall Street Memes community. Therefore, this cryptocurrency now has the potential to complete a successful token presale. </p>
<p>While the Wall Street Memes token does not offer any utility, it will be offering 100% of the token supply for the community.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wall Street Memes Next 10x Crypto (BIG NEWS) - $WSM Ready to Explode!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMFoYignziY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Recently concluding a presale that secured over $25 million, the Wall Street Memes project saw a quick sell-out. Its $WSM tokens, listed on OKX on 26 September, saw a 275% increase within four days.</p>
<p>Another 30% of the token supply will be offered as community rewards. 10% each of the remaining token supply will be allocated for CEX and DEX liquidity. After the presale ends, $WSM will likely list on top-tier exchanges, such as Binance, due to the token’s popularity. </p>

<h3>4. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; Hold This Ecosystem’s Native Token to Gain Multiple Web3 Use Cases</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a> aims to create a single entry point to access multiple web3 use cases. All this will be made possible by holding $LPX, the native token. On Launchpad XYZ, users can create their own Web3 crypto wallet by providing only their phone number or email address. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/324858/launchpad-img.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ web3 project" /></figure>
<p>With the crypto wallets, one can interact with multiple DApps (Decentralized Applications), swap cryptocurrencies, and gain self-custody of their assets. Launchpad XYZ will also host its own NFT decentralized exchange. Those that hold and stake $LPX can avail discounts on trading fees on the DEX. </p>
<p>Through this DEX, users will be able to access multiple trading pairs and also access limited, perpetual contracts. Notably, users that stake a monthly average of 10,000 $LPX can also get guaranteed access to certain web3 presale listings. </p>
<p>Through these listings, users can explore the biggest upcoming presale tokens. Since users can access the new presale tokens directly on their Launchpad XYZ wallets, entering into new projects with the $LPX token is easier. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/312588/launchpad-web3.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Launchpad XYZ will also launch its own P2E place, allowing members to access a wide collection of games and metaverse experiences. The platform will also introduce a Learn2Earn game through which traders can create trading strategies and earn token rewards. </p>
<p>With $LPX, token holders can also purchase assets holding historical value, such as real estate or art. Currently, $LPX is priced at only $0.0445 during the ongoing presale round. By the time the exchange listing takes place, the price will increase to $0.0565 per token. </p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ has raised over $1.3 million since the start of the presale. Read the <a href="https://whitepaper.launchpad.xyz/">Launchpad XYZ whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/Launchpad_Official_Channel">Telegram channel</a> for more information on this cryptocurrency project. </p>

<h3>5. yPredict &#8211; Next-Gen Trading and Research Crypto Platform </h3>
<p>While multiple crypto tokens have been providing price increases, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> aims to offer multiple use cases with its native token, $YPRED. This token can primarily be used to purchase monthly subscriptions to predictive models through yPredict’s financial marketplace. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/275525/ypredict-robot.jpg" alt="yPredict AI crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The models offer data-driven insights on the crypto markets and have been offered and created by AI analysts and financial quants. The models are verified by members of the yPredict DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).</p>
<p>In these models, yPredict offers trading signals leveraging artificial intelligence. Furthermore, AI tools such as Natual Language Processing are leveraged to offer sentiment analysis on crypto tokens. yPredict also offers research and predictions on various tokens by studying 25+ chart patterns. </p>
<p>For those looking to learn more about crypto, yPredict lets them take quizzes and assessments through a Learn2Earn ecosystem. In this ecosystem, users can earn $YPRED tokens by successfully passing the quizzes. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/271801/ypredict-features.jpg" alt="yPredict project features" /></figure>
<p>This platform will also introduce a play-to-earn platform where members can make directional bets on the future of crypto markets. The top performers can also earn $YPRED. Finally, the platform will create a staking pool for passive income. </p>
<p>This pool distributes 10% of all subscription fees and 15% of the swapping fees collected are distributed to existing token holders. Currently, $YPRED is available to buy on presale for only $0.1 per token. </p>
<p>By the time the exchange listing takes place, the price will rise to $0.12 per token. yPredict has raised more than $3.4 million since the start of the presale.

<h3>6. Chainlink &#8211; Data-Driven Crypto Project Packed with Intrinsic Value</h3>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is a favorite among investors looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">best future cryptocurrency projects</a>. The project was created as a way to implement data gathered off-chain into on-chain projects. This has massively opened up what&#8217;s possible in the world of crypto and web3. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/223290/chainlink-site.jpg" alt="Chainlink home page" /></figure>
<p>With Chainlink offering such an in-demand service, it should be of little surprise that the project has been picked up a plethora of high-profile entities including Aave, Polygon, and even Google Cloud. Thanks to its first-mover status and its long list of established partnerships, the project is likely to continue growing for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>Chainlink is one of the most impressive crypto projects on the market right now. It offers investors a huge amount of intrinsic value at a comparatively low cost compared to the token&#8217;s previous highs. Being one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> available right now, it&#8217;s well worth keeping an eye on LINK throughout the coming months.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy LINK on eToro</a>
<h3>7. XRP &#8211; Transactional Cryptocurrency Held Under Water by Legal Issues</h3>
<p>Created by David Schwartz and Jeb McCaleb, XRP is a transactional cryptocurrency focused on creating a simple, low-cost, and energy-efficient solution for internal money transfers and currency conversion. While Schwartz and McCaleb later formed Ripple Labs to boost the XRP ecosystem and build use cases, it&#8217;s a common misconception that Ripple created XRP. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/223291/xrp-site.jpg" alt="Ripple home page" /></figure>
<p>While XRP has cemented itself as a transactional powerhouse through tactical partnerships with a number of well-regarded institutions like the Bank of America, the project has since expanded its goals. In 2021, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was launched, giving the network smart contract functionality and allowing new applications to be created using the XRP network. </p>
<p>While XRP has proven itself as a strong asset, a recent lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has led to doubt among some investors. While we&#8217;ll have to wait and see how things play out, it seems likely that XRP will make it out the other side largely unscathed, making XRP one of the top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm">cryptos to watch</a> right now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy XRP on eToro</a>
<h3>8. Quant &#8211; Project Created to Facilitate Interoperability Between Blockchains</h3>
<p>Quant (QNT) is one of the most undervalued crypto projects and one of the overall top interoperability-focused cryptocurrencies available. The project enjoyed huge success in 2021, increasing in value by almost a factor of 10 before falling back to earth alongside the collapse of the crypto market. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/223293/qnt-site.jpg" alt="Quant crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Since the invention of altcoins, it has been difficult to make different blockchains work together. This issue gives rise to architecture standards like Ethereum&#8217;s ERC. However, Quant has taken a different approach, using a blockchain-based operating system known as Overledger to allow different blockchains to work with one another. </p>
<p>With QNT&#8217;s impressive performance in 2021, there&#8217;s a clear demand for the project. In order to use the Overledger, an application must own a certain amount of QNT, boosting demand further as the project&#8217;s adoption increases. With this in mind, the project is surely one of the most undervalued cryptocurrencies in 2023. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy QNT on eToro</a>
<h3>9. Basic Attention Token &#8211; Crypto Project Reshaping Online Advertising</h3>
<p>Perhaps the best-undervalued cryptocurrency for 2023 within the advertising space is the native cryptocurrency of the Brave browser, the Basic Attention Token (BAT). One half of the BAT ecosystem, the Brave browser is a privacy-focused web browser with a built-in ad blocker.  </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/223294/bat-site.jpg" alt="basic attention token home page" /></figure>
<p>The token is used to reward people browsing the web for the advertisements they see, boosting engagement between adversities and users. Furthermore, the BAT concept has enabled advertisers to get a far greater return on their ad spend than would be possible using other platforms. </p>
<p>The Brave browser has been gaining a large number of users as of recent thanks to its innovation and improvements to a service used by nearly every internet user on the planet. Although the future price of BAT will be heavily linked to the success of the Brave browser, things are looking promising for this interesting project. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy BAT on eToro</a>
<h3>10. Cardano &#8211; Popular Crypto Project Building a Secure Smart Contract Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Rounding off our list of the most undervalued crypto projects is Charles Hoskinson&#8217;s Cardano (ADA). While the token was launched in 2017, it packed up traction in 2021 as an alternative to Ethereum eventually climbing to an all-time high of around $3.10.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88821/223295/cardano-website.jpg" alt="Cardano bloakchain" /></figure>
<p>The project was designed as a heavily decentralized and secure blockchain and has been successful on this front. Cardano was one of the first large-cap cryptocurrencies to implement the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that has now been picked up by post-merge Ethereum. </p>
<p>While many investors aren&#8217;t a fan of the time it takes for Hoskinson to fulfill his goals, it seems logical that it&#8217;s better for updates to take a while rather than be rushed and insecure. As it stands today, Cardano is one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market, and with a loyal community, it&#8217;s unlikely for this status to fade anytime soon. </p>

<h3>What Makes a Cryptocurrency Undervalued?</h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s true that &#8216;undervalued&#8217; will be a subjective term, the majority of investors will likely be able to agree on a few key attributes that make a cryptocurrency undervalued. Typically, if an asset has greater intrinsic value than perceived value, it can be considered undervalued. </p>
<p>Intrinsic value simply refers to a project&#8217;s utility. For example, if a certain cryptocurrency provides a service that is actually needed within the industry, it will always have a utilitarian demand, helping to bolster its value regardless of the current market conditions. </p>
<p>On the other hand, perceived value is what investors believe an asset is worth. This is influenced in a large part by hype and buyer sentiment. As such, once things start going awry perceived value tends to melt away as the interest in an asset declines. </p>
<h2>How to Find Undervalued Crypto</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are a plethora of techniques that can be utilized to find the top undervalued cryptocurrencies. We&#8217;ll be sharing a few of the most powerful. </p>
<h3>Analyze Price During Market Downturns</h3>
<p>Although it might seem counterproductive, looking for undervalued assets during periods of negative growth can be a great way to find some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-low-cap-crypto.htm">low-cap crypto gems</a>. When the market is suffering, overvalued assets will likely decline faster or to greater proportions. However, undervalued assets will remain strong and decline comparatively less despite the macroeconomic conditions. </p>
<h3>Search for Trending Projects</h3>
<p>Websites like CoinMarketCap are packed with statistics on almost every cryptocurrency on the market. Searching these platforms for projects that have been trending or experiencing increased volume for longer periods of time can be a big help when it comes to finding undervalued crypto for 2023. </p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to look at the price history to ensure that an asset hasn&#8217;t experienced a recent pump that could have pushed it into overvalued territory. </p>
<h3>Compare an Asset to Similar Projects</h3>
<p>While this method isn&#8217;t perfect, it can be a great way to figure out which projects are undervalued when the proper research is done. Comparing the value of one asset to another similar project can be helpful but it&#8217;s crucial that both projects fulfill very similar objectives, have similar statistics, and have similar tokenomics. </p>
<h3>Look for Projects with Ample Intrinsic Value</h3>
<p>Naturally, looking for a project packed with intrinsic value and utility is a large part of finding undervalued projects. If an asset is priced cheaply when considering its function, then it could make for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">good long term crypto investment</a>. Conversely, just because an asset is cheap doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good investment, must also provide ample value for its target audience. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Throughout this article, we&#8217;ve taken a look at some of the most undervalued crypto projects available to purchase right now, discussed what makes an asset undervalued, and provided a few techniques that can be used to find undervalued assets. </p>
<p>While each of the projects we&#8217;ve mentioned is strong, throughout our research, we noticed that one, in particular, has massive room for growth. Bitcoin ETF Token is a popular token presale based around the spot ETF Bitcoin approval by the SEC. The presale raised $500,000 within the first week and you can now buy it for $0.0052.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><br /><strong>What is the most undervalued cryptocurrency?</strong></p>
<p>Although each of the projects we reviewed in this list can be considered undervalued, a couple of cryptos showed huge room for growth. Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, Wall Street Memes, yPredict and Launchpad XYZ seem primed to take off as core functionality begins to get rolled out, making them worthy of consideration. </p>
<p><strong>How do I tell if a cryptocurrency is undervalued?</strong></p>
<p>There is a large variety of factors that affect whether an asset can be dubbed undervalued. However, in short, if an asset offers more intrinsic value than it has perceived value, it can be considered undervalued and could make for a solid investment (as long as its fundamentals are sound). </p>
<p><strong>Which crypto will boom in 2023?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to predict which projects will explode with 100% accuracy. However, Bitcoin ETF Token has already had a great start to its presale, raising over $500,000 in less than two weeks.</p>

<h2>The Best Blockchain App Development Agencies &#8211; Reviewed in Detail</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Because everyone has different needs, we&#8217;ve opted to include a mixture of firms operating solely within the blockchain space as well as those offering broader development services with a specialist blockchain team. </p>
<h3>1. Tech Alchemy &#8211; Specialized Blockchain App Development Company with a Strong Track Record </h3>
<p>For anyone looking to start a blockchain app development project, <a href="https://www.techalchemy.co">Tech Alchemy</a> could be the perfect partner. Since the company began operating in 2016, the Tech Alchemy team has gone from strength to strength, working on numerous high-profile projects and developing a wealth of experience. </p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s highest-rated blockchain agency, Tech Alchemy has been working with the blockchain, mobile apps, and everything in between for years. Some of the company&#8217;s most prevalent past projects include a Dragon&#8217;s Den-winning AI advertising platform called Toad.ai and an agricultural trading platform called House of Crops.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/95848/238993/tech-alchemy-mobile-site.jpg" alt="Tech alchemy website" /></figure>
<p>Tech Alchemy is able to handle just about any blockchain-related app development request.

<p>With Tech Alchemy boasting a team consisting of 45 expert developers and eight experienced designers, the firm can work with clients to deliver projects at blinding speeds while still providing unparalleled results. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/277461/screen-shot-2023-05-26-at.jpg" alt="Pikamoon token presale page" /></figure>
<p>Firstly, $PIKA can be used to purchase Pikamoon NFTs, your in-game avatars in the world of Dreva. The Dreva environment consists of four different regions &#8211; the Flame Empire, Thunder Collective, Water Kingdom, and the Earth Regions. </p>
<p>There are a total of 18,012 Pikamoon NFTs, each belonging to one of the four regions. Depending on which NFT you hold, you can enter and explore the regions of Dreva. While exploring, users can expand their empires by purchasing land and capturing new Pikamoon NFTs. </p>
<p>Through a battle system, one can leverage their NFT avatars in battle against other opponents. The Pikamoon metaverse will host a leaderboard showing the performances of your avatars. The <a href="https://docs.pikamoon.io/introduction/pikanomics">Pikamoon whitepaper</a> states that the top performers are rewarded with $PIKA tokens. </p>
<p>$PIKA can also be used to purchase NFT items such as weapons, healing potions, spells, and capture devices. These items will help strengthen your NFTs and increase your likelihood of winning the online competitions. </p>

<p>Thus, Pikamoom aims to offer thrilling gameplay with revenue-earning opportunities. $PIKA can be purchased for $0.0004 per token through the ongoing presale round. By the final phase, the price will increase to $0.0006 per token. </p>
<p>Since the presale started, Pikamoon has raised more than $1.6 million. Join the Pikamoon <a href="https://docs.pikamoon.io/introduction/pikanomics">Telegram channel</a> to stay updated with this crypto gaming project. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Tamadoge &#8211; NFT Project Combining Meme Coin Potential with P2E Game</strong></h3>
<p>While some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-nft-projects.htm">new NFT projects</a> lack in the way of utility, <a href="https://gridglass48.co/box_90da238324b03fa24c3099914aa14f50">Tamadoge (TAMA) </a>is a meme coin and NFT-based play-to-earn (P2E) game that is packed with both utility and potential. </p>
<p>Although the project’s presale was scheduled to last until Q4 2022, the entire token allocation sold out early due to investor demand, raising $19m and cementing its status as one of the best <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presales</a> of the year.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/224673/tamadoge.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Tamadoge utilizes NFT technology for almost every aspect of its upcoming P2E game. This has enabled the team to ensure that in-game assets can be easily bought, sold, and traded, helping to create a robust in-game economy</p>
<p>At the center of the Tamadoge ecosystem is a unique and expansive metaverse world named the ‘Tamaverse’. Within this virtual world, players are free to explore and interact with each other while caring for and raising ‘Tamadoge pets’, which are structured as NFTs. Later down the line, the Tamaverse will support virtual reality headsets and become available on mobile devices. </p>
<p>As the Tamadoge pets take the form of an NFT, each is unique, tradable, and upgradeable. To level up a Tamadoge pet, a player can provide it with items from the Tamadoge store, including cosmetics, food, and toys. Each time a pet ranks up, its owner receives Dogepoints, improving their leaderboard ranking and entitling them to a larger share of the rewards pool. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/224674/tamadoge-nfts.jpg" alt="Tamadoge NFTs" /></figure>
<p>Due to the incredible reception the presale received and the pump after listing, Tamadoge&#8217;s team opted to release Tamadoge NFTs early. </p>
<p>A total of 21,100 are now available, with the allocation divided into three classes – Common, Rare, and Ultra-Rare. </p>
<p>The higher the class that an NFT is in, the better its attributes – which naturally leads to an increased chance of winning PVP battles for the holder. As such, Tamadoge is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-games.htm">best NFT game</a> crypto enthusiasts can play in 2023.</p>
<p>The 100 Ultra-Rare NFTs have boosted stats and a 90% increased chance of moving to the top of the global leaderboard when the game is released.</p>
<p>Due to their high strength, only 100 of these NFTs will be released. Thus, investors who are able to acquire one of the exclusive Ultra-Rare NFTs will give themselves the best chance of in-game success and rewards generation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219433/grab-some-tama.jpg" alt="Tamadoge coins" /></figure>
<p>They raised more than 250ETH at auction and became the top trending collection on NFT marketplace OpenSea</p>
<p>The collection currently has a floor price of around 4ETH, with only six NFTs listed for less than 80ETH.</p>
<p>Tamadoge has already become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrency</a> projects out there, bolstered by the token’s recent listing on OKX. This listing led the TAMA price to soar by nearly 2,000%  from the presale price.</p>
<p>Tamadoge&#8217;s team hasn&#8217;t stopped there, with more listings on the horizon as well as an arcade-style mini-game called Enter the Tamaverse.</p>
<p>Those looking to keep tabs on this exciting project can do so by joining the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram</a> group.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://gridglass48.co/box_90da238324b03fa24c3099914aa14f50" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy Tamadoge on OpenSea</a>
<h3><strong>5. Lucky Block &#8211; NFT Competition Platform with Huge Prizes</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lucky-block-casino/">Lucky Block (LBLOCK)</a> is an online competition platform that hosts a crypto casino and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-giveaways.htm">best NFT giveaways</a>. The project has made use of NFTs and blockchain technology in order to streamline the platform and provide efficient rewards distribution.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219428/lucky-block-nft.jpg" alt="Lucky Block NFT collection" /></figure>
<p>Each competition on the Lucky Block platform can be entered using an NFT in the style of an entry ticket featuring a unique design and identifying number. In order to provide options for users of every budget, the cost and the total number of each NFT differs based on the potential jackpot. </p>
<p>In addition to the standard prize draws, Lucky Block also hosts regular Platinum Competitions for holders of the Platinum Rollers Club (PRC) NFT collection. Each PRC NFT can be purchased from NFT Launchpad and provides the holder entry to every new Platinum competition. With prizes for this exclusive competition including a real-life Lamborghini, it&#8217;s certainly worth checking out. </p>
<p>On top of the potential to win huge prizes, every Lucky Block NFT also provides the holder with long-term value in the form of a daily share of the rewards pool. This ensures that everyone&#8217;s a winner and nobody gets left out.</p>
<p>The project recently transitioned to the ERC standard in order to launch a campaign of CEX listings. Currently, the project has been listed on LBank, MEXC, and Gate.io. With more listings planned, the LBLOCK token is likely to experience a surge in demand boosting its price and making it one of the best <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> projects to invest in right now. </p>
<p>The Lucky Block team working tirelessly to make the project as good as possible and has also announced a 1% monthly burn of the token supply that will see the coin become more scarce and should increase value.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well worth taking a look at for any investor trying to find the best NFT to buy.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Battle Infinity &#8211; NFT-based Fantasy Sports Platform with DeFi Elements</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity (IBAT)</a> is a brand new fantasy sports, P2E, and DeFi platform that utilizes NFTs and blockchain technology in order to create a bustling ecosystem filled with potential. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219435/ibat-premier-league.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity crypto project" /></figure>
<p>During the Battle Infinity presale, the project raised over 16,500 in just 25 days. This was a huge achievement for the team and highlighted just how much demand there was for a high-quality NFT-based fantasy sports platform. When IBAT was listed on PancakeSwap, demand surged causing over a 300% increase in the price of the token. With stats like this, IBAT could be the year&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoin</a>. </p>
<p>While IBAT does boast a tax on transactions, it&#8217;s completely adjustable in order to facilitate exchange listings. This is excellent for the token, as it will make it much easier for the project to get listed on high-profile platforms like Binance.</p>
<p>The IBAT ecosystem contains a wide variety of features. Therefore, to make it easy to navigate, it&#8217;s broken into six platforms, a fantasy sports league, a collection of P2E games, an NFT marketplace, a decentralized exchange, a Metaverse arena, and a staking platform.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219436/ibat-tokenomics-2.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to participate in the fantasy sports league (IBAT Premier League), a player will need to buy an NFT pass. For the fantasy sports league, this pass will provide the holder with a budget that can be used to build a virtual team in order to earn real prizes.  </p>
<p>Overall, Battle Infinity is likely the best NFT crypto on the market and with the release of the IBAT NFT marketplace, it could soon also become the best place to buy NFTs. Check out Battle Infinity and join the <a href="https://t.me/battleinfinity">IBAT Telegram group</a> to hear about the latest updates before anyone else. </p>

<h3><strong>7. Wen Sandwich &#8211; BAYC Artist Invites You to Create Sandwiches</strong></h3>
<p>There’s a food truck heading for the crypto market and it’s being driven by the artist of the Bored Ape Yacht Club artwork, Migwashere. This unique artwork, called <a href="https://www.wensandwich.xyz/?utm_source=CN"><u>Wen Sandwich</u></a>, has all the ingredients to be a truly special NFT art set, as it allows collectors to create their very own sandwich from a list of over 150 ingredients. </p>
<p>This is no regular NFT artwork and that’s not just because it was created by Migwashere. Collectors can choose various proteins, veggies, seasonings, and sauces to create their very own sandwiches. You can imagine how the crypto community will get excited to create their special sandwich built on a real world home recipe and proudly display that. NFT marketplaces are about to be filled with some killer recipes &#8211; or maybe joke inedible sandwiches created for the heck of it.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/250229/image1.jpg" alt="Wen sandwich pixel art" /></figure>
<p>The fact there are 150 ingredients allows for so many possibilities. You can be sure that there will be the usual tried and tested kind, like a BLT or peanut butter and jelly, but expect some crazy combinations as well. </p>
<p>Food lovers are going to lose it when the minting begins towards the end of January. What’s more, the mint price is also very low at 0.05 ETH. This lowers the barrier of entry and allows anyone to get to make their very own digital sandwiches. There’s little time left before this happens, so keep a close on Wen Sandwich and get in early before everyone starts creating their sandwiches. Of course, you can always add more ingredients to the sandwich to make it even more delicious.</p>
<p>The success of this new Migwashere NFT artwork could be massive. After all, he brings the experience that comes from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, as well as previous collections Sneaky Vampire Syndicate and HoF Goat Lodge. It would not be surprising if Wen Sandwich is what kicks off the NFT market in 2023, after the rather dull 2022 it had because of the crypto winter.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/250230/screenshot-2023-01-16-at-17-45-07.jpg" alt="Wen sandwich pixel art" /></figure>
<p>It’s going to be interesting to see what sandwiches the crypto community comes up with. There is going to be something special served up in the NFT market this month. </p>

<h3><strong>8. The Uncharted  &#8211; Sci-FI NFT Collection With High-Interest Returns</strong></h3>
<p>There aren’t many NFT projects out there that are like <a href="https://theuncharted.space/?utm_source=CryptoPR"><u>The Uncharted</u></a>. On top of being an NFT collection with a striking theme and setting, it is also a project strongly focused on finance. The team has described the project as one that is focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and Web3. The NFT collection is expected to launch in Q1 2023.</p>
<p>The Uncharted is more of a financial project than a typical NFT collection when you look at it. That’s not to say that there aren’t benefits to holding the NFT &#8211; in fact, it’s key because that’s where all the benefits lie. The real benefit comes in the long-term profit potential as the project’s High-Frequency Trading fund grows.<img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/236143/image1.jpg" alt="Uncharted NFT project" /></p>
<p>There are a total of 21,000 NFTs up for sale, with holders being privy to a range of financial benefits. First and foremost, 100% of the sales revenue is placed in the XETA Capital Fund (XCF) High-Frequency Trading fund. This fund will distribute a percentage of its profit every quarter to all NFT holders via an airdrop. Past performance indicates that the monthly payable returns are about 20%. </p>
<p>There is a 36-month period for investment, compounding, and distribution of profits. However, users are not locked in and can sell their NFTs anytime in between on OpenSea.</p>
<p>All that said, there are still the qualities associated with an NFT project that a collector might come to expect. The project will begin its first chapter, The Southern Ring Nebula soon, and chapters two to four are already under development.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/236144/image2-min.jpg" alt="Uncharted NFT project ROI" /></figure>
<p>The team behind The Uncharted has been doxxed and they have decades of experience in the financial world. The project is also collaborating with Xeta Capital, another successful DeFi venture.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Silks &#8211; NFT with real-world derivatives for P2E </strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.silks.io/promo?utm_source=CryptoPR">Silks</a> ecosystem provides the best NFT with real-world derivatives for P2E gaming. Silks is a fantasy sports project that mirrors the real world of thoroughbred horse racing. The blockchain project has a metaverse that allows users to own, trade, train, and earn rewards from real-world thoroughbred racing horses.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/231814/image1.jpg" alt="Silks NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The Silks Horses are derivatives of real-life racehorses, and the P2E rewards are based on actual events. You are rewarded in the Silks metaverse if you own the NFT horse that wins in real-world races. </p>
<p>The project was created by a team with an immense wealth of experience in the horse racing industry. Troy Levy founded the project. He is the owner of Circle 8 Farms and the CEO of Tropical Racing, a company that specializes in sourcing winning thoroughbred racehorses for clients. These companies have strategic partnerships with Silks to bring the P2E metaverse ecosystem to life. </p>
<p>First, you must own one of the Silks Avatars to participate in the Game of Silks. The Silks Avatars are your digital identity in the Silks metaverse, allowing you to participate and collect rewards. They also provide you with a lifetime mint pass for the annual Yearling Sale &#8211; the event that will enable you to mint Silks Horses NFTs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/231815/image2.jpg" alt="Silks avatar" /></figure>
<p>In total, the Silks Avatars collection consists of 10,000 NFTs. The first 5,000 NFTs were sold in April 2022 and quickly bought by top-tier investment firms and prominent NFT collectors. Even wallets that own Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs bought some Silks Avatars. As a result, the Silks Avatars became a top 10 best-selling Sports NFT on OpenSea and was added to the prestigious Nansen.ai Gaming 50 Index. </p>
<p>The final 5,000 Silks Avatars are still up for sale, but the collection is 65% sold out. You can <a href="https://www.silks.io/promo?utm_source=CryptoPR">currently buy them for 0.25 ETH</a>, and once the entire collection is sold, your only option to buy will be on secondary markets at higher prices.</p>
<p>Overall, Silks is ready to bring thoroughbred horse racing to the blockchain. This sport produces $11 billion annually and always performs remarkably well in any market condition &#8211; including recessions. As a result, we expect the entire Silks ecosystem to flourish once they launch in early 2023.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Cocky &#8211; An Exclusive NFT-Based Lifestyle Club for Music Events</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cockynft.io/?utm_source=CN">Cocky</a> is an exclusive lifestyle club that provides all holders of its Cocky Can NFT collection access to world-class music events in prestigious locations. The Parasol Group created the project on a mission to change the definition of utility in the cryptocurrency space by providing real-world experiences to holders.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/231817/image1.jpg" alt="Cocky NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The NFT collection consists of 10,000 Cocky Cans, with 51 different skin variations and a tier-based colored lid system (silver, gold, or black) representing the benefits holders receive. The different tiers unlock a range of benefits, including </p>
<ul>
<li>Subsidized transport</li>
<li>Event accommodation </li>
<li>Additional invites</li>
<li>Bar tabs. </li>
</ul>
<p>One lucky person will get a Cocky Black Can, which provides VIP benefits at Cocky events. In addition to the benefits mentioned above, the black Can holders will receive flights, luxury accommodations, meet and greets with the artists, and all-access passes. </p>
<p>The Cocky Can NFT collection is expected to drop in Q4 2022.</p>
<p>One great feature of the Cocky NFTs is their ability to mutate. These Mutations appear as stamps on the background of the NFT each time the holder interacts with the ecosystem, allowing them to write a story about their journey through Cocky.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/231819/image2.jpg" alt="Cocky NFT project" /></figure>
<p>All the music events revolve around electronic dance music, and Cocky intends to hold at least two in-person shows yearly, with regular live streams. The events will take place in prestigious locations across the globe, meaning you finally won’t be dancing in a muddy field. Instead, each event will focus on the location’s landscape, culture, and history. </p>
<p>As the events are in unconventional locations, the ticket volume will be limited depending on the venue’s capacity. Therefore, Cocky NFT holders must quickly register their interest in attending the events. If a holder receives a ticket and cannot attend, they can sell their ticket on the custom-built secondary marketplace to other NFT holders.</p>

<h3><strong>11. MetaBlaze &#8211; New NFT Presale with Unique Rewards System</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/3RORQIR">MetaBlaze</a> is in the final stages of its token presale while its MetaGoblins NFT sale is also due to start this week.</p>
<p>The project is unique because it&#8217;s the first P2E game that will reward gamers with other tokens &#8211; not its native MBLZ.</p>
<p>Usually, P2E games distribute rewards in their native tokens but they can be less attractive to players given the volatility and shelf life of new coins.</p>
<p><iframe title="MetaGoblin 3D Traits Collection &amp; NFT Games | Opensea NFT Marketplace" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LP8j7g2RJY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>MetaBlaze is developing the first revolving rewards pool that will see users receive Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB for their efforts &#8211; making it much more appealing for casual gamers who want to stack those established coins.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean MBLZ has no value, however, with the token acting as a crucial in-game currency for the two MetaBlaze games currently in development. The presale is less than $600,000 away from its hard cap of $4 million, while the token also has a robust burn mechanism that will eventually see 48% of its total supply cut.</p>
<p>The flagship game is a narrative-driven RPG that sees players explore and conquer the Galaxia Blue universe, with finer details to come in the following weeks.</p>
<p>MetaMinez, which is close to being completed, is a strategic, time-bound mini-game that sees players stake MBLZ for mining rigs, with Total Mining Power then Calculated.</p>
<p>After a set amount of time, the player with the highest Total Mining Power wins and is rewarded in crypto. The MetaGoblins NFTs, set to go on sale on October 15, also have a crucial role in both games. </p>
<p>Read through the <a href="https://metablaze.xyz/">MetaBlaze Whitepaper</a> for a full breakdown of the project &#8211; potential investors can also join the <a href="https://t.me/meta_blaze">Telegram group</a> for the latest news.</p>

<h3><strong>12. Bored Ape Yacht Club &#8211; Popular Blue-Chip NFT Collection</strong></h3>
<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection is arguably the most famous series of NFTs on the planet. Since its release, the project has catapulted to the forefront of the NFT market with crypto enthusiasts and celebrities alike clamoring to get their hands on a project many consider to be the best NFT to buy. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219419/bayc-website.jpg" alt="Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection" /></figure>
<p>The collection was created by Yuga Labs and has since given rise to a host of affiliated collections like Mutant Ape Yacht Club, some of which were given away to BAYC holders. Each NFT provides the holder access to a ton of members-only benefits including access to a collaborative graffiti board and exclusive access to new Yuga Labs projects. </p>
<p>With the Bored Ape Yacht Club originally costing just 0.08 ETH to mint and now trading for around 74 ETH ($130,000), it has undeniably been one of the best NFTs to flip for early investors. </p>
<p>The project also launched ApeCoin (APE), which has been an extremely <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/12-most-volatile-cryptos-trade-invest-2022.htm">volatile crypto</a> but has drawn huge interest and demand in the space.</p>
<p>While the general appetite has dropped off slightly as a result of the crypto market&#8217;s decline, the project still enjoys a massive amount of celebrity endorsement, meaning it could well be the best NFT to buy right now.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Otherdeed &#8211; NFT Plots of Land in Massively Popular Blockchain Game</strong></h3>
<p>The Otherdeed collection represents parcels of land in the upcoming Otherside Metaverse world, co-developed by Yuga Labs. There are currently a total of 100,000 Otherdeed NFTs with another 100,000 expected to be released in the future and given to those actively improving the Otherside ecosystem.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219421/otherside-website.jpg" alt="Otherdeed NFT collection" /></figure>
<p>As each NFT represents a plot of land, anyone that holds an Otherdeed NFT will be able to create buildings, experiences, and games on the land, similar to The Sandbox or Decentraland. Owners of any Bored Ape Yacht Club or Mutant Ape NFTs will receive a free Otherdeed NFT and with the floor price currently hovering just below 2 ETH, this is quite a sizable reward. </p>
<p>It seems that anything Yuga Labs touches turns to gold, so it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see Otherdeed soon counted among the best NFT tokens. </p>
<h3><strong>14. Moonbirds &#8211; NFTs designed for Long-Term Staking </strong></h3>
<p>Moonbirds is a collection of 10,000 new NFTs designed in the style of profile pictures. Each features unique artwork based on owls and boasts a variety of special characteristics, each with its own rarity.  The collection was created by PROOF and is expected to have a multitude of users within the Web3 developers upcoming projects. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219422/moonbirds-website.jpg" alt="Moonbirds NFT collection" /></figure>
<p>In addition to acting as a stylish profile picture, each Moonbirds NFT can be staked (or nested as they call it) in order to earn rewards. When a Moonbird is staked for longer periods, it will improve its nest, and allow the holder to achieve new tiers. Furthermore, Moonbird holders are granted entry into an exclusive private membership club with like-minded investors.  </p>
<p>With the Moonbirds team boasting a strong plan for the project&#8217;s future and incenting long-term holding, the collection could be one of the best NFTs to invest in, as well as one of the overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">best future cryptocurrency projects</a> currently available. </p>
<h3><strong>15. 8liens NFT &#8211; Low-Cost Profile Picture Style NFT Collection</strong></h3>
<p>The 8liens collection of 10,000 unique NFTs has been experiencing a huge amount of demand recently and seems to be gearing up to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cheap-nft-projects.htm">best cheap NFTs</a>, with a floor price of just 0.08 ETH. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219423/8liens-website.jpg" alt="8liens NFT collection" /></figure>
<p>As a newly released collection, if 8liens can continue on its current trajectory, it&#8217;ll likely give even the best NFT for 2023 a run for its money. The 10,000 8liens NFTs are split into six different sub-species each featuring a unique style. Adding even more uniqueness, each 8lien comes with its own traits including heads, eyes, bodies, and clan. </p>
<p>Despite 8liens being purely created as NFT art, the project has been attracting a lot of attention recently with many investors drawing parallels between the project and CryptoPunks. If 8liens can enjoy even a fraction of the success enjoyed by CryptoPunks, it could be the best NFT to buy right now. </p>
<h3><strong>16. Pudgy Penguins &#8211; Series of 8,888 NFTs Providing Access to Exclusive Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>The Pudgy Penguins collection consists of 8,888 NFTs that are, as the name would imply, based on penguins. With Pudgy Penguins achieving a total volume of more than 60,000 ETH (over $100,000,000) and boasting a floor price of just 3 ETH, many investors are speculating that the collection could be the best NFT to buy right now. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219424/pudgy-penguins-website.jpg" alt="Pudgy Penguins NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The Pudgy Penguins team aims to make the collection a beacon of positivity within the NFT industry. This is a noble ambition and will likely do wonders when it comes to helping the collection build a strong and loyal community. Holders of the collection will be able to claim a free Lil Pudgys NFT and will receive exclusive access to holder-only events, experiences, and competitions.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s still early days for Pudgy Penguins, the project has been attracting a lot of attention, meaning it could end up being one of the best NFT projects of the year in terms of growth. </p>
<h3><strong>17. DeGods &#8211; Solana-Based Collection with Strong Community Ties</strong></h3>
<p>DeGods is a collection of 10,000 NFTs created on the Solana blockchain. In addition to acting as high-quality, unique tokenized art, every DeGod holder can join a community of like-minded investors, developers, and thought leaders. With many members of this community holding important roles in the industry, this is an invaluable asset.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219425/degods-website.jpg" alt="DeGods NFT project" /></figure>
<p>On top of providing access to a community filled with key players in the crypto industry, DeGods allows its holders to stake their NFTs in order to earn $DUST. The token is used to purchase upgrades as well as access to events, products, and merch. While the token suffered due to the collapse of the crypto market, it has shown strength recently with many believing it could be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos to buy</a>.  </p>
<p>The collection has been garnering a lot of attention recently, in part thanks to DeGods rewarding purchasers with a random amount of DUST as an added thank you. The collection has almost 1 million SOL in volume, making it one of the best NFT projects currently available. </p>
<h3><strong>18. Doodles &#8211; Emerging Web3 Project with Excellent Artwork</strong></h3>
<p>While many NFTs feature boring artwork or try to copy popular collections, Doodles is packed with originality and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cool-nft-projects.htm">cool NFT</a> artwork. The collection&#8217;s art was created by well-known designer Burnt Toast and features a gorgeous pastel color palette. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219426/doodles-website.jpg" alt="Doodles NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The Doodles collection takes a community-first approach to NFTs, acting similar to a decentralized autonomous organization. Every Doodle holder is able to vote on what the Doodle Treasury Fund gets spent on and which experiences get funded. Furthermore, Doodles will distribute Space Doodles NFTs to Doodles holders in order to reward its supporters. </p>
<p>The collection is regarded as being one of the best NFTs to flip and with it boasting nearly 150,000 ETH in volume and a floor price of 7.35 ETH.  it&#8217;s easy to see why the project has been in such high demand, with Space Doodles selling for even more than the regular collection. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Find Highly Investable NFTs </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Below, we&#8217;ll share a few tips that can be used to find great NFT projects primed for investment. On top of finding investable NFTs, it&#8217;s crucial that an investor arms themselves with the best wallet for NFTs. There are a ton of options out there, but overall, MetaMask takes the cake as the best wallet for NFTs.</p>
<h3><strong>Social Media</strong></h3>
<p>Social Media is a phenomenal tool to find the best NFTs to invest in. Almost every project worth investing in will be on social media as it helps the brand to engage with its fans. When using platforms like Twitter to find good NFTs, it&#8217;s worth looking at the comments and shares rather than likes and followers as these statistics can be easily skewed by bots.</p>
<h3><strong>Popular Collections</strong></h3>
<p>While it might seem counter-intuitive, taking a look at popular NFT collections can be a great way to find new NFTs with potential. Sometimes, a project will release a new NFT collection within the same ecosystem. This helps the project capitalize on existing brand recognition and as such, is worth looking out for. </p>
<h3><strong>NFT Marketplaces</strong></h3>
<p>The best place to buy NFTs is also one of the best places to determine which collections will perform well. In order to buy and sell NFTs, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-apps.htm">best NFT apps</a> like OpenSea is required. Because of this, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-marketplaces.htm">NFT marketplaces</a> are a great way to see how collections are experiencing the most demand with phenomenal accuracy. </p>
<h3><strong>Upcoming NFT Aggregators</strong></h3>
<p>There is a myriad of platforms that exist solely to promote upcoming NFT collections. Generally, these platforms feature collections that are yet to mint, making them an excellent source to find the best cheap NFTs. However, some projects do pay to be promoted on these platforms, so it&#8217;s always worth checking out the collection&#8217;s website and whitepaper to ensure it is legitimate.</p>
<h3><strong>NFT Characteristics </strong></h3>
<p>Almost every prominent NFT collection will feature traits or characteristics with various rarities. By taking a look at the characteristics a specific NFT has, it&#8217;s possible to gauge whether it&#8217;s undervalued compared to similar NFTs within the same collection. With many NFT holders neglecting to check these statistics before selling, this can be a great way to find the best NFT to buy for immediate profit. </p>
<h3><strong>Community</strong></h3>
<p>A common theme in the world of NFTs is a distinct focus on community. As such, taking a look at a collection&#8217;s various communities (Telegram, Discord, social media) can be a great indicator of how investors are feeling about a project. With buyer sentiment being one of the main driving forces behind the value of an NFT of collection, this is not something to overlook. </p>
<h3><strong>Utility</strong></h3>
<p>While hype is a large factor in determining which collection will contain the best NFT to buy, taking a look at utility is equally, if not more important. By understanding how a project generates value for its investors, it&#8217;s possible to work out if it will still have value if things turn sour. </p>
<p>In general, as look as an NFT boasts useful features, it will likely perform well regardless of the market. With many investors and climate activists asking &#8216;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/are-nfts-bad-for-the-environment.htm">are NFTs bad for the environment?</a>&#8216; some new NFT utility projects have started to discover new ways to combat the climate crisis in 2023.</p>
<h2><strong>Buying the Best NFT Tokens &#8211; Explained</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In order to ensure that nobody has any difficulty, we&#8217;ve outlined exactly how to buy Ecoterra, one of the best NFT cryptos.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Register with an Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>As $ECOTERRA is an ERC token, an investor must first acquire either ETH or USDT to participate in the presale. This can be attained from a <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">regulated broker like eToro</a> in just a few minutes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219440/register-etoro.jpg" alt="eToro create account" /></figure>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong>Buy ETH on eToro</strong></a></p>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Deposit Funds and Buy ETH</strong></h3>
<p>If an investor decides to go with eToro to purchase ETH, after creating an account they will need to deposit. Thankfully, eToro makes this process easy and supports a range of payment methods including wire transfers, credit/debit cards, and e-wallets (PayPal, Skrill, etc). After depositing, search for &#8216;ETH&#8217;, press &#8216;Trade&#8217;, and confirm the purchase. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219441/buy-eth.jpg" alt="Purchase ETH coins" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Create a Crypto Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Once the ETH has been purchased, a crypto wallet is needed to store it. MetaMask and Trust Wallet are both free and user-friendly. Then, make sure it&#8217;s set to the Ethereum network, move the ETH to the eToro Money Wallet, and then withdraw to your wallet of choice.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87137/219443/metamask-site.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Buy ECOTERRA</strong></h3>
<p>After completing the aforementioned steps, we&#8217;re ready to purchase some ECOTERRA, simply head over to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ecoterra/">Ecoterra website</a>, connect a crypto wallet, and then press &#8216;Buy with ETH&#8217; or &#8216;Buy with USDT&#8217; to open the purchase menu, insert the desired quantity of tokens and complete the purchase. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><br /><strong>What is the most in-demand NFT?</strong></p>
<p>According to statistics available from OpenSea, the Bored Ape Yacht Club has experienced the most demand over the past 30 days followed closely by Otherdeed. However, once Ecoterra hits the open market, we could see the projects make huge gains given its unique ability to offer NFT Carbon credits.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of NFTs sell best?</strong></p>
<p>While pixel art-based collections have previously proven to be a favorite among investors, the focus now seems to be on utility-centric projects like Ecoterra and Swords of Blood, as they provide investors with far more long-term value.</p>
<p><strong>How do I find good NFTs to buy?</strong></p>
<p>There is a multitude of ways to find the best NFTs to buy, but some of the easiest and most effective include browsing through NFT marketplaces to find trending collections, looking on social media to determine which collections people are buying, thoroughly reviewing the utility offered by a particular collection before buying. </p>

<p>Looking for the cheapest NFT projects in 2023? Keep reading as we reveal the top 11 coolest NFT projects that have taken the sector by storm so far. <b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. DogeStar &#8211; New Doge-Themed Crypto will Feature an Upcoming NFT Marketplace </b></h3>
<p><a href="https://dogestar.net/index.html">DogeStar</a> ($DOGESTAR) is a new cryptocurrency platform that will offer various Web3 elements such as an NFT marketplace and metaverse environment to token holders. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1296" height="715" class="aligncenter wp-image-122770 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698666512-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-4-29-42-pm.png" alt="DogeStar token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698666512-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-4-29-42-pm.png 1296w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698666512-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-4-29-42-pm-300x166.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698666512-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-4-29-42-pm-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698666512-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-4-29-42-pm-768x424.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px" /></p>
<p>While meme coins tend to offer little utility to users, DogeStar will soon incorporate various different DeFi elements. DogeStar has released a well-detailed seven-phase platform roadmap to describe the upcoming platform features. </p>
<p>While the focus on the short-term is the ongoing $DOGESTAR presale and exchange listings, DogeStar is focusing on adding different NFT elements in the coming months. </p>
<p>Phase 5 of the DogeStar roadmap will feature NFT development and the launch of NFT collections. By phase 6, these newly released NFTs will be deployed on the DogeStar metaverse. Thus, token holders can access unique avatars, and earn rewards on the ecosystem. </p>
<p>In the future, DogeStar will also launch a merchandise store and start carrying out charitable initiatives. </p>
<p>Thus, the focus is on building a loyal community of investors who are willing to stick with the project for the long haul. Currently, $DOGESTAR is priced at only $0.00000025 per token during the fourth phase of the presale. By the time $DOGESTAR lists on exchanges, the price will increase to $0.0000006 per token &#8211; a 140% price jump. </p>

<p>The smart contract has been successfully audited by Coinsult, and the team behind DogeStar has experience working in the Web3 and blockchain space. </p>
<p>Since the start of the presale, this new cryptocurrency has raised more than $315K. Stay updated with this project by joining the <a href="https://t.me/dogestar_en">DogeStar Telegram channel</a> and following the <a href="https://twitter.com/DogeStar_Token">Twitter</a> account. </p>

<h2><strong>Are New NFTs a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/make-money-with-nfts.htm">making money with NFTs</a> and investing in the NFT market, oftentimes it&#8217;s the new NFT projects that offer the most upside potential. While popular collections can make for lower-risk investments, they&#8217;ll typically offer less room for growth as demand has already been mostly priced in. </p>
<p>Some investors have made huge sums from simply buying and selling NFTs. While this won&#8217;t be the case for everyone, the NFT market is one that shouldn&#8217;t be ignored. Despite only rising to notoriety over the past few years, the global NFT market is worth an estimated $40 billion. </p>
<p>There are even some collections (the Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example) now selling for tens of thousands of dollars despite originally minting for free. While not every NFT will make for a good investment, taking the time to do the proper due diligence can yield amazing results. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Find New NFT Projects</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although it&#8217;s true that new NFT drops and NFT mints can offer investors ample returns, not every project is worth investing in. As such, we&#8217;ll be sharing a few different techniques an investor can use to find new NFT projects and a few more that can be used to determine which are worth investing in. Many crypto enthusiasts also find new NFT projects via the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-apps.htm">best NFT apps</a> such as OpenSea.</p>
<h3><strong>Social Media</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most valuable tools when it comes to finding new NFT projects is social media. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly. almost every NFT project will need social media for promotion, it helps to put the brand in front of like-minded people and generate hype. As such, searching relevant terms or tags (e.g. #NFTs) can be a great way to find new NFT drops. </p>
<p>Secondly, in contrast to a project&#8217;s website which can be easily manipulated, social media accounts show user interaction, making it far easier to see which projects are resonating the most with investors. </p>
<h3><strong>NFT Launchpads </strong></h3>
<p>Another great technique for finding the best new NFTs is browsing through launchpads to find interesting projects. Many new NFTs begin life on a launchpad. This puts the collection in front of a very targeted audience. Additionally, as most launchpads offer some type of escrow service, they have the added benefit of reassuring investors that the project won&#8217;t simply disappear with their funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Established Projects</strong></h3>
<p>It makes sense that if a certain NFT collection enjoys great success, its team would want to continue creating new collections and expanding the ecosystem. Therefore, despite seeming counterproductive, keeping tabs on already established projects can be a great way to find new NFT projects that are primed to explode. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to reward loyal fans and early supporters, a lot of collections will offer early access or discounts to people that hold another NFT from the same ecosystem. A perfect example of this is the Bored Ape Yacht Club which rewarded holders time and time again, airdropping APE tokens as well Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs to holders. </p>
<h3><strong>Utility</strong></h3>
<p>Outside of hype, one of the largest driving forces behind the value of a specific NFT is intrinsic value or utility. While any collection can skyrocket as a result of excellent marketing, it&#8217;s those that serve a real purpose that will stand the test of time and survive market downturns. As such, it&#8217;s worth taking the time to understand a project&#8217;s goals and use cases before investing. </p>
<p>Some NFT projects have even started addressing the question &#8216;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/are-nfts-bad-for-the-environment.htm">are NFTs bad for the environment?</a>&#8216; You can read more about this in our in-depth guide. </p>
<h3><strong>Attainable Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, just about anyone is able to state they will revolutionize a certain sector or solve a previously unsolvable issue. However, we new NFTs are actually able to live up to their promises. As such, looking for collections with attainable goals and a clear roadmap will typically yield less risk and better results compared to investing in those with lofty ambitions and no real way to achieve them. </p>
<h3><strong>Doxxed Team</strong></h3>
<p>While not a guarantee of legitimacy or growth, if an NFT collection&#8217;s team is willing to put their names to a project, it does show that they have faith in the project. Therefore, looking for collections that boast a fully-doxed team can help to filter out those simply created as a quick cash grab. With that said, it&#8217;s better to use this technique in conjunction with others for the best results. </p>
<h3><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important factors to look out for when trying to find the newest NFT projects to invest in is transparency. All too often a project will hide behind complex fancy terminology that has little meaning in reality. Rather than wasting time with these projects, it&#8217;s better to look for those that clearly explain their goals, discuss how they will be achieved, and share progress with their fans. </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ve taken a look at 11 of the top new NFT projects, discussed whether NFTs make for good investments, and explained a few ways to find new NFTs and filter out the very best collections. </p>

<h3><strong>1. Tamadoge &#8211; New NFT Drop on OpenSea with Huge Potential</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://gridglass48.co/box_90da238324b03fa24c3099914aa14f50">Tamadoge (TAMA)</a> leverages the recognition of meme coins, metaverse technology, and play-to-earn (P2E) mechanics to cement itself as one of the best NFT projects on the market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that investors share this sentiment as the project recently became one of the year&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a>, raising $19 million in funding in less than eight weeks, highlighting why TAMA is one of the most hyped upcoming NFTs that also offers the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-giveaways.htm">best NFT giveaways</a> in 2023.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/222404/tamadoge-moon.jpg" alt="Tamadoge NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The two most important aspects of the Tamadoge P2E experience are the metaverse world known as the Tamaverse and the 3D-animated pets structured as NFTs.</p>
<p>The Tamaverse is a painstakingly crafted, expansive world. Players can explore, interact with each other, and train their pets in what will be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-games.htm">best NFT games</a> of 2023. </p>
<p>Later down the line, there are plans to release augmented reality support for the Tamaverse and make it accessible on mobile, allowing players to look after their pets on the go. With such clear plans for the future, Tamadoge could be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">best NFT</a> to buy right now.</p>
<p>Within the Tamaverse, players can train, breed, and battle tokenized Tamadoge pets, with each pet 100% tradeable and unique. </p>
<p>Tamadoge&#8217;s core gameplay centers around training these pets. Each can be leveled up using food, toys, and cosmetic items, all of which will be available to purchase within the in-game pet store.  </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/224664/tamadoge-nfts.jpg" alt="Tamadoge NFTs" /></figure>
<p>By improving their pets, players can enhance their leaderboard ranking and earn monthly rewards paid out in TAMA. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Tamadoge’s team has opted to release these Tamadoge Pets ahead of the game’s launch, allowing investors to get involved early.</p>
<p>A total of 21,100 Tamadoge NFTs are now available, with the allocation divided into three categories – Common, Rare, and Ultra-Rare.</p>
<p>Each category represents a different level of ‘strength’, with the Ultra-Rare NFTs featuring the best stats and attributes. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/224665/tama-okx.jpg" alt="Tamadoge NFT and OKX exchange logo" /></figure>
<p>Only 100 of these <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cool-nft-projects.htm">cool NFTs</a> are available – highlighting how exclusive they are – and they became the top trending collection on OpenSea after launch, raising more than 250ETH in sales.</p>
<p>The Ultra Rare NFT pets currently have a floor price of 4ETH, with only six listed below 80ETH.</p>
<p>With this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cheap-nft-projects.htm">cheap NFT project</a> making such a large splash in the short time since its release, analysts are still forecasting massive price surges following TAMA&#8217;s recent listings. Check out the project today and join the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram</a> to stay informed about any new developments. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Battle Infinity &#8211; Exciting NFT Project with DeFi and P2E Aspects</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity (IBAT)</a> is a P2E gaming and DeFi ecosystem that utilizes NFTs to provide users with an intuitive and rewarding experience. It&#8217;s one of the latest NFT projects that are upcoming and not a project that any investor will want to overlook. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221897/ibat-homepage.jpg" alt="battle infinity website" /></figure>
<p>Despite its functionality only beginning to roll out on September 24 (starting with a staking platform), Battle Infinity is already enjoying great success and being regarded as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">11 best altcoins</a> on the market. </p>
<p>The project sold out its presale 65 days ahead of schedule before going on to do a 4x as soon as it was listed on PancakeSwap. </p>
<p>As Battle Infinity is packed to the brim with features, it&#8217;s split into a few different platforms. In addition to the upcoming staking platform, there is also a fantasy sports league where players are tokenized and tradable, a collection of NFT-based P2E games, an NFT marketplace, a detailed Metaverse arena, and a decentralized exchange (DEX). </p>
<p>To participate in the IBAT Premier League (fantasy sports league), a player will need to acquire an NFT pass. After doing so, they will be granted a budget to buy players, the stats of which are based on real-world performance. </p>
<p>In addition to earning the top players rewards, NFT passes can be easily sold for crypto using the project&#8217;s propriety Battle Marketplace (NFT marketplace). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221888/battle-infinity-staking.jpg" alt="battle infinity staking" /></figure>
<p>With the rollout of the IBAT Battle Stake platform on September 24, it&#8217;s likely <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> IBAT could explode as users rush to stock up on tokens to earn rewards and get prepared for the rollout of the IBAT Premier League.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it could be worth acquiring some tokens ahead of schedule from PancakeSwap or LBank. Furthermore, joining the <a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">IBAT Telegram</a> will ensure that an investor hears about further updates before anyone else. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Cocky &#8211; An NFT lifestyle club that provides real-world utility to holders</strong></h3>
<p>It has long been debated whether NFTs actually provide any utility for holders beyond fancy art and investment potential. Well, one project seeks to change this by providing holders with real-world utility in attending exclusive music events. That project is <u>Cocky</u>, an NFT-based lifestyle club that provides access to world-class electronic dance music events in prestigious locations.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/231836/image2.jpg" alt="Cocky NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The Parasol Group created the project, which seeks to change the definition of utility by allowing its holders to attend once-in-a-lifetime experiences that money can’t buy &#8211; only ownership can. The team intends to host at least two annual in-person and regular virtual events for all holders. </p>
<p>The collection consists of 10,000 Cocky Can NFTs and is expected to drop in Q4 2022. Each can in the collection will have one of the 51 skin variations with a colored lid to represent the tier-based system of benefits received at events by holders. The different tiers unlock a range of benefits that include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Subsidized transport</li>
<li>Accommodation</li>
<li>Additional invites</li>
<li>Bar tabs</li>
<li>Exclusive merchandise</li>
</ul>
<p>The rarest NFT is the Black Can, which provides the holder with VIP benefits in perpetuity. The additional benefits include flights to luxury resorts before the events, meet and greets with the artists, and all-access backstage passes. </p>
<p>The NFTs have a unique function that allows them to display Mutations as stamps in the background. Each stamp is collected when the holder attends one of the events, allowing them to write their own stories about their journey in the ecosystem. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/231837/image3.jpg" alt="Cocky NFT project" /></figure>
<p>Furthermore, all Cocky events are expected to take place in prestigious locations that will pay attention to the area&#8217;s landscape, history, and culture. Due to the unconventional locations, the ticketing volume will depend on the venue’s capacity. If an NFT holder receives a ticket and cannot attend, they are free to sell it on the secondary market to other Cocky token holders. </p>
<p>Overall, Cocky is one of the best upcoming NFT drops to invest in during 2023. Its unique approach to providing real-world utility for all holders will help the project thrive over the coming years. </p>
<h3><strong>4. Mini Melties &#8211; Art-Focused Collection with Physical Elements</strong></h3>
<p>Out of all the upcoming NFT projects, Mini Melties is one of the most hyped. It features artwork created by Buff Monster in addition to its merit as a high-quality piece of digital art, each NFT entitles the holder to a range of benefits that secure the collection as one of the top upcoming NFT drops. </p>
<p>There is a total of 2,000 Mini Melties NFTs up for grabs, each unique and boasting rare traits from a diverse pool. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221903/mini-melties-site.jpg" alt="mini melties NFT project" /></figure>
<p>Another reason why Mini Melties could be one of the best upcoming NFTs to buy is that by swapping a few NFTs, it&#8217;s possible to attain a unique and handcrafted physical piece. Furthermore, holders will get exclusive access to limited collectibles. </p>
<p>With Buff Monster already being a popular digital artist, it makes sense that Mini Melties could become one of the best new upcoming NFTs of the year. </p>
<h3><strong>5. Who Is Emily &#8211; Deflationary Collection of NFTs Based on Paintings</strong></h3>
<p>While some of the best upcoming NFT projects feature artwork that wouldn&#8217;t be out of place in children&#8217;s cartoons, Who Is Emily has instead focused on creating high-quality &#8216;museum grade&#8217; artwork. </p>
<p>The collection of 10,000 unique NFTs is stylized as portrait paintings and has been generating a fair bit of buzz in the world of upcoming NFT mints. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221904/who-is-emily-site.jpg" alt="who is Emily crypto project" /></figure>
<p>While this upcoming NFT&#8217;s primary focus is on art, each piece also comes with a myriad of other benefits. Firstly, holders will receive private access to an exclusive DAO community that deals out rewards paid for by the community treasury. </p>
<p>The project also plans to open both real-world and Metaverse art galleries which will host decentralized auctions. </p>
<p>With Who Is Emily&#8217;s focus on bringing high-quality art to both the real world and the Metaverse, the collection&#8217;s potential is apparent. </p>
<p>As the team will initiate buybacks to remove some NFTs from circulation, it could prove to be one of the year&#8217;s top upcoming NFTs to buy. </p>
<h3><strong>6. Deeds of the World &#8211; Risk-Style Play-to-Earn NFT Game</strong></h3>
<p>Deeds of the World is one of the latest upcoming NFT drops to offer holders a way to earn while playing games. </p>
<p>With that said, the collection takes a fresh approach to the sector which could make it one of the best upcoming NFTs to mint this year. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221894/deeds-of-the-world-site.jpg" alt="deeds of the world crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The project allows players to collect NFTs based on real-world countries and territories. Each NFT is allocated points based on its size in real life. As a player accumulates land, they earn points, boosting their leaderboard ranking. </p>
<p>While each NFT is worth a certain number of points, completing country sets earns the holder bonuses and burns the territory NFTs making the collection deflationary. </p>
<p>By collecting territories and countries, players can earn tokens that can be converted to unique NFT art based on real-life artists or sold and converted to cash or crypto. </p>
<p>With such an interesting concept, it would be no surprise to see Deeds of the World become one of the top upcoming NFT projects in 2023. </p>
<h3><strong>7. Igloo Genesis &#8211; Collection of 6,666 NFTs Designed to Raise Awareness of Global Warming</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that increased emissions and non-environmentally friendly manufacturing processes are affecting the world around us.</p>
<p>Igloo Genesis aims to raise awareness for this issue with a collection of 6,666 NFTs based on Igloos. With there being an increasingly large focus on the environment, we could see Igloo Genesis become one of the best upcoming NFT drops.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221893/igloo-genesis-collection.jpg" alt="igloo genesis NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The project has chosen igloos as its muse as the penguins in Antarctica and polar bears in the arctic are both expected to be forced close to extinction over the coming decades. </p>
<p>As such, the Igloo Genesis team has decided to raise awareness of the issue through free upcoming NFT mints. </p>
<p>With such noble ambitions and completely free upcoming NFT drops, it&#8217;s entirely possible that Igloo Genesis will perform well once it&#8217;s released on September 30. </p>
<h3><strong>8. Mystic Motors &#8211; Highly Competitive P2E Racing Game</strong></h3>
<p>One of the upcoming NFT mints helping to take P2E gaming to the next level is Mystic Motors, a collection of 8,000 NFTs created on the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Each NFT will be sold for 0.1 ETH and provides the holder access to a vehicle in the Mystic Motors game. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221895/mystic-motors-site.jpg" alt="mystic motors NFT project" /></figure>
<p>In order to create a unique experience for its users, each of the Mystic Motors new upcoming NFTs will feature unique traits like color, wheels, and bodies. Users can earn crypto rewards by engaging in Mystic Motors races, with the tokens able to be easily cashed out or used to purchase vehicle upgrades.</p>
<p>In addition to its competitive racing elements, Mystic Motors also plans to give users the option to earn rewards by collecting vehicles or acting as an in-game shopkeeper. </p>
<p>Out of the new upcoming NFTs, Mystic Motors offers one of the most unique concepts so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see whether they can deliver on their promises. </p>
<h3><strong>9. Magic Eden &#8211; NFT Artwork Based on the Garden of Eden with Real-World Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>Magic Eden is one of the most hyped upcoming Solana NFT projects. The collection has been created taking inspiration from both the mythical Garden of Eden and real nature. </p>
<p>In contrast to the vast majority of upcoming Solana NFTs, Magic Eden will initially launch with just four NFTs up for grabs. Rather than the traditional mint, this collection will be auctioned off with a 50 SOL starting price. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221905/magic-eden-site.jpg" alt="magic eden NFT project" /></figure>
<p>The primary goal of the Magic Eden upcoming Solana NFT drops is to help bring the trading of 1/1 exclusive artwork to the Solana network. As such, holders of the genuine Magic Eden NFT collection will receive a large, real-world version of their NFT. </p>
<p>While there are a lot of great upcoming Solana NFT projects, few command as much respect from the art community as Magic Eden. </p>
<p>As such, it&#8217;s entirely possible that this extremely limited collection could be one of the best upcoming NFT drops of the year.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Fitness Fiends &#8211; NFT Collection Providing Access to Real-World Gyms</strong></h3>
<p>Fitness Fiends is another of the new upcoming NFTs focused on the real world equally as much as the digital. As the name implies, the collection of 6,666 Ethereum-based NFTs has a heavy focus on working out and personal fitness.</p>
<p> The collection will initially be sold for 0.12 ETH with a presale launch date of October 28, 2022.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88272/221896/fitness-friends-site.jpg" alt="fitness fiends NFT project" /></figure>
<p>While the collection&#8217;s 6,666 NFTS will each feature unique artwork and various rarity-weighted traits, that is far from its only utility. Of the NFT projects that are upcoming this year,</p>
<p>Fitness Fiends offers potentially the most exciting real-world utility. Holders of the collection will receive free access to a real-life chain of gyms with the first location opening in London.  </p>
<p>Although the collection does have an apparent focus on providing real-world utility, holders will also receive exclusive access to Metaverse fitness classes and friendly games. </p>
<p>As the Fitness Fiends gym will be open to the paying public it incorporates real business into the world of NFTs. As such, this is one of the upcoming NFT mints worth looking out for. </p>
<h2><strong>Are Upcoming NFTs a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With the NFT market being worth billions and some popular collections selling for tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, it makes sense that a large number of crypto enthusiasts are wondering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/make-money-with-nfts.htm">how to make money with NFTs</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>However, the answer to such a question is far from black and white. As with cryptocurrency, some NFT collections will make phenomenal investors for early supporters. </p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s also true that some collections will likely fizzle out well before they have a chance to attract ample demand to really shine. Therefore, a better question would be &#8216;How can I find the best upcoming NFT drops?&#8217;. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover a plethora of ways an investor can find the top upcoming NFT projects in the next section, but for now, let&#8217;s look at what makes a particular collection a good investment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whitepaper &#8211; </strong>One of the easiest ways to separate the best upcoming NFTs from lackluster projects that are unlikely to succeed is by reading through its whitepaper. If a project can clearly explain its vision and how certain goals or milestones will be achieved, it&#8217;s far more likely to perform well when compared to those simply throwing around fancy terminology. </li>
<li><strong>Generating Revenue &#8211; </strong>While many collections are focused on art, at its core, an NFT project is more akin to business than a piece of artwork. Many projects offer various airdrops, competitions, and rewards but if the project cannot generate revenue, it&#8217;s unlikely to withstand the test of time. </li>
<li><strong>Team &#8211; </strong>Taking a look at the team behind a project is one of the best ways to filter great new upcoming NFTs from the bad. If a team is doxed, has previously had success in the NFT market, and communicates clearly with holders and fans, it&#8217;s a large step in the direction of success. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Find Upcoming NFT Projects</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><br />Aside from using the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-apps.htm">best NFT apps</a>, what are the best ways to find upcoming NFT projects in 2023? </p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve explored a few ways to determine which upcoming NFTs are worth investing in, it&#8217;s time we discuss how to actually find the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">best future cryptocurrency projects</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>Twitter</strong></h3>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s finding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> or upcoming NFT projects, Twitter has become the go-to social media platform for crypto-centric ventures. As such, it&#8217;s an invaluable tool when it comes to looking for upcoming NFT drops.</p>
<p>Searching through popular hashtags like #NFT or #CryptoCommunity, and many others can yield excellent results. </p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to remember that a social following can be easily faked so it&#8217;s crucial to always perform ample due diligence. </p>
<h3><strong>Messaging Groups</strong></h3>
<p>Messaging platforms have also become extremely popular with NFT collections as they provide an easy and efficient way for a team to communicate with their fans.</p>
<p>A couple of the most popular sites are Telegram and Discord. Typically, members of these groups will hear about new plans or updates before anyone else so it can be worth joining to get a feel for the project before investing. </p>
<h3><strong>NFT Launchpads</strong></h3>
<p>With the rise of NFTs, it&#8217;s of little surprise that a large number of platforms have been created to help launch new collections. These platforms are commonly referred to as NFT Launchpads. </p>
<p>They help get a new collection in front of a highly targeted audience and can sometimes assist in marketing efforts. Therefore, browsing NFT launchpads can be helpful for discording exciting new projects.</p>
<h3><strong>Popular Projects </strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s commonplace in the world of NFTs for a popular collection to release other projects within the same ecosystem. This gives new investors a chance to get involved without paying resell prices and provides more revenue for the collections. </p>
<p>Oftentimes, a collection will hand out free or early access mints to holders of a parent collection, so it&#8217;s worth looking out for any announcements. </p>
<h3><strong>NFT Marketplaces</strong></h3>
<p>In order to be sold easily, an NFT must be listed on a marketplace. As such, they&#8217;ve become hubs for both new and established collections. </p>
<p>The vast majority of popular NFT marketplaces (OpenSea, Rarible, etc) will have a section featuring new or upcoming NFTs, making finding upcoming NFT mints a breeze. </p>
<h3><strong>NFT Calendars</strong></h3>
<p>While NFT Launchpads are primarily designed to assist projects, NFT calendar websites were created with investors in mind. They will aggregate upcoming collections, compiling key details like price and collection size. </p>
<p>With NFT calendars often featuring a massive amount of projects, they can be great tools. However, some offer sponsored placements so researching before investing is key.</p>

<p>However, during our research, we noticed that a particular project seems primed to take off after its fully released.  Tamadoge is our top pick because of it&#8217;s meme potential and utility within the Tamadoge ecosystem and games.</p>

Wen Sandwich &ndash; The New NFT Artwork from Bored Ape Yacht Club Artist Migwashere</h3><p>The value of an NFT largely depends on the credibility of the artist. Migwashere is an established NFT artist best known for Bored Ape Yacht Club, Sneaky Vampire Syndicate, and HoF Goat Lodge. Apart from NFTs, his artworks have been used in books, video games, tabletop games, animated films, movies, and the toy industry.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/250233/image1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/250233/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250233/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250233/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250233/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250233/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1200" class="content-img"></figure><p style="text-align:justify;">But Migwashere&rsquo;s reputation partly explains the hype around <a href="https://www.wensandwich.xyz/?utm_source=CN"><u>Wen Sandwich</u></a>. It is an artwork collection that stands out in its own right. In fact, it is one of the most interesting NFT artworks of recent years. The pixel art NFT collection allows you to create your own custom sandwich NFT, by choosing from over 150 ingredients. You will find everything from the basics to fancy favorites, and even weird-ass sandwich combos on the menu.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The key highlight of the artwork is its cultural variations. No matter which part of the world you&rsquo;re from, you will find a Wen Sandwich that tantalizes your taste buds.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Wen Sandwich minting will start at the end of January 2023. While the artwork doesn&rsquo;t have a supply limit, it has a time limit. You can mint Wen Sandwiches only during the scheduled period. After that, you can buy second-hand sandwiches from secondary markets. Wen Sandwich is a community-driven artwork collection built on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/250234/image2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/250234/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250234/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250234/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250234/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/250234/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1200" class="content-img"></figure><p style="text-align:justify;">Once the minting begins, head to the official Wen Sandwich website, connect your wallet, and curate your Sandwich with ingredients of your liking. The NFTs will be delivered to your account on checking out. Wen Sandwiches are priced from 0.05 ETH.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.wensandwich.xyz/?utm_source=CN"><strong><u>Visit Wen Sandwich</u></strong></a></p><h3>2. Tamadoge &#8211; Exciting NFT and Meme Coin Project with P2E Features</h3><p><a href="https://gridglass48.co/box_90da238324b03fa24c3099914aa14f50">Tamadoge (TAMA)</a> is a P2E gaming NFT project and perhaps the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cool-nft-projects.htm">coolest NFT project</a> to invest in right now.&nbsp;</p><p>The asset takes elements from meme coins and the Metaverse in order to create an engaging ecosystem that resonates with crypto investors.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/227104/tama-splash.jpg" alt="tamadoge splash image" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/227104/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_835_627.jpg 835w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227104/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_720_540.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227104/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_600_450.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227104/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_300_225.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="835" class="content-img"></figure><p>People participating in the Tamadoge ecosystem can raise, breed, and battle virtual 3D-animated pets. The core gameplay occurs within a Metaverse world known as the Tamaverse. In this virtual universe, players can view their pets, interact with one another, and explore.&nbsp;</p><p>Tamadoge pets are tokenized as NFTs and can be upgraded using items available from the in-game store including cosmetics, toys, and food. Each time the ranking of a pet improves, its holder earns Dogepoints, improving their leaderboard ranking and increasing their share of the rewards. This creates a positive feedback loop incentivizing players to keep improving their pets.&nbsp;</p><p>Investors have enjoyed this concept, with the Tamadoge earning $19 million during its presale before soaring in value from a $0.03 listing price to a high of $0.197 just days after its release on the leading exchange OKX.&nbsp;</p><p>This impressive growth reinforced Tamadoge&#8217;s status as one of the top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/utility-nft-projects.htm">utility NFT projects</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/227105/tama-nft-cards.jpg" alt="tamadoge nfts" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/227105/responsive-images/tama-nft-cards___media_library_original_1008_695.jpg 1008w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227105/responsive-images/tama-nft-cards___media_library_original_900_620.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227105/responsive-images/tama-nft-cards___media_library_original_720_496.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227105/responsive-images/tama-nft-cards___media_library_original_600_413.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227105/responsive-images/tama-nft-cards___media_library_original_300_206.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1008" class="content-img"></figure><p>While some investors might think the best is over, Tamadoge is only just getting started. The project has recently launched its 21,000 NFT Pet collection, which will be used in the highly-anticipated Tamadoge game.</p><p>The 100 Ultra Rare Pets &#8211; which boast improved stats and traits &#8211; became the top trending collection on OpenSea when it launched, after raising 250ETH.</p><p>While those still have a floor price of 5.7ETH &#8211; and only six listed below 80 ETH &#8211; the Common-tier Pets are available for 0.2ETH.</p><p>With the release of the Tamagoge NFT collections marking the rollout of the project&#8217;s core features, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how TAMA performs over the coming months.</p><p>Join the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram group</a> to keep up-to-date with the project&#8217;s latest developments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gridglass48.co/box_90da238324b03fa24c3099914aa14f50"><strong><u>Buy Tamadoge NFTs</u></strong></a></p><h3>3. Silks &#8211; A Thoroughbred Horseracing P2E Game</h3><p>The NFT market has no shortage of projects and collections on sale at the moment. However, very few of them offer something new and unprecedented. Those are the projects that, if you get in early, can lead to strong returns should things go well.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/231831/image2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/231831/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_900_386.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231831/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_720_309.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231831/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_600_257.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231831/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_300_129.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img"></figure><p><a href="https://www.silks.io/promo?utm_source=CryptoPR"><u>Silks</u></a> look like one of those NFT projects &#8211; with sales going on right now, that could be a massive bargain. Silks is a P2E game with a metaverse that mirrors the real world of thoroughbred horse racing. If a horse wins in the real world, it is reflected in the game, and players stand a chance to win rewards. These rewards come in the form of NFTs.</p><p>The game has several NFT collections, including Silks Avatars, Horses, Stables, and Land. <a href="https://www.silks.io/promo?utm_source=CryptoPR"><u>Silks Avatars</u></a> is the sale that is going on right now, and over 65% of it has already been sold. It has even reached the top 10 sports NFTs on OpenSea. These avatars are important because they allow you to play the game and reap its many benefits.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/231832/image1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/231832/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_1583_753.jpg 1583w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231832/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_1200_571.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231832/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_900_428.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231832/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_720_342.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231832/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_600_285.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231832/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_300_143.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1583" class="content-img"></figure><p>Silks have a total of 10,000 Silks Avatars, which have different traits and rarities. With such unique mechanics, picking up an avatar now could explain why there is such a rush for the NFTs. Benefits of having a Silks Avatar include a lifetime mint pass for the annual Genesis Yearling Sale, exclusive experiences, giveaways, and IRL events.&nbsp;</p><p>Players have a wide variety of activities to participate in, including buying, breeding, trading, and racing their horses. There is also a Community Horse Farms, where staking allows you to earn rewards in NFTs. You can also build Horse Farms on Silks Land in exchange for a fixed fee and a share of the rewards generated by Silks Horses.</p><p>Silks is undoubtedly, one of the more exciting NFT projects around.

They intend to host at least two in-person events alongside regular virtual events annually. To have the opportunity to attend these immersive experiences, you will have to hold one of the Cocky NFTs.</p><p>The NFT collection is expected to mint at some point in Q4 2022. It will consist of 10,000 Cocky Can NFTs with 51 different skin variations and three separate colored lids to distinguish the tier-based benefits received. Some benefits include luxuries such as additional invites, bar tabs, accommodation, and subsidized transport.</p><p>Furthermore, there will be one extremely rare &ldquo;Black Can&rdquo; NFT that provides the following benefits;</p><ul><li>Return business class flights to the event</li><li>A plus two invite&nbsp;</li><li>Accommodation in a luxury resort</li><li>Meet and greets with the artists</li><li>All-access passes at the event.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In addition to the Black Can, three lucky NFT holders will also experience their Cocky Cans &ldquo;Blacking Out&rdquo; for 24 hours before an event. This signals that they are VIP guests and can claim additional perks, including VIP access, luxury flights and accommodation, and a hefty bar tab to enjoy with their guests.&nbsp;</p><p>Cocky has created a unique utility for their NFTs, dubbed Mutations. These Mutations appear on the background of the NFT and appear as stamps when an NFT holder attends the Cocky events or interacts with the ecosystem. Eventually, the mutations will make every NFT unique, as Cocky NFT holders write their own stories through the feature.</p><p>Cocky events won&rsquo;t be your typical EDM festival in muddy fields or abandoned warehouses. Instead, the events will take place in unconventional locations that pay homage to the location&rsquo;s culture, landscape, and history.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/231851/image1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/231851/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_760_398.jpg 760w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231851/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_720_377.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231851/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_600_314.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/231851/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_300_157.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="760" class="content-img"></figure><p>Due to the unconventional locations, ticket volume will depend on the venue&rsquo;s capacity. Therefore, token holders must be quick in registering their interest in attending each event. If a token holder receives an NFT and cannot attend, they are free to sell the ticket on the secondary market. In addition, only Cocky NFT holders can purchase tickets from the secondary market, adding further utility to the NFT.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Cocky is set to change the definition of utility in the NFT space by providing access to events that money cannot buy &#8211; only ownership can.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.cockynft.io/?utm_source=CN"><strong>Visit Cocky Today</strong></a></p><h3>5.

As such, its NFT collection contains a total of over 85 thousand items, all of which are usable in-game.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90602/227128/crypto-heros.jpg" alt="mycryptoheroes website" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90602/227128/responsive-images/crypto-heros___media_library_original_943_893.jpg 943w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227128/responsive-images/crypto-heros___media_library_original_900_852.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227128/responsive-images/crypto-heros___media_library_original_720_681.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227128/responsive-images/crypto-heros___media_library_original_600_568.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90602/227128/responsive-images/crypto-heros___media_library_original_300_284.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="943" class="content-img"></figure><p>The project features a wide variety of different ways to earn. Users can rent out MyCyptoHeros characters to use within the game in order to earn rewards in the form of rays, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a>. Alternatively, users can buy heroes and rent them out to other people in order to earn a profit.&nbsp;</p><p>With the collection starting at just 0.002 ETH, it&#8217;s worthy of consideration for investors looking for the cheapest NFT to buy. As the collection features so many items, it&#8217;s important to understand the function of each in-game in order to get a solid basis for determining which cheap NFTs to flip.</p><h2>Are Cheap NFTs a Good Investment?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Investors looking for cheap NFTs to buy now will likely be wondering whether the assets will perform well as an investment. While it&#8217;s difficult to predict the cheap NFTs that will explode, we&#8217;ve rounded up a few reasons why cheap NFTs can make for good investments.&nbsp;</p><h3>Upside Potential</h3><p>Are you looking for NFTs and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">cryptos with the most upside potential</a>? While expensive collections can be attractive for investors looking to minimize risk, they tend to lack the upside offered by cheaper collections. In cryptocurrency, value is driven in a large part by demand. As such, investing in a project that is still relatively new can yield far greater returns than a collection that everybody already knows about. &nbsp;</p><h3>Lower Capital Requirements</h3><p>With even the cheapest Bored Ape NFT selling for tens of thousands, many high-profile NFT collections are out of reach for the average person. However, investing in cheap NFTs that will explode can allow people to get exposure to one of the fastest-growing sectors (NFTs) without having to outlay huge amounts of capital.</p><h3>Utility</h3><p>It&#8217;s a common misconception that cheap NFTs lack utility. In fact, the best cheap NFT projects are often more innovative than expensive collections. As such, investing in cheap NFTs to buy now can be a great technique to get exposure to the latest concepts in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p><p>IMPT is a great example, its NFTs have a real-world use case that will help users offset their carbon footprints and tackle global warming.</p><h3>Less Established</h3><p>Typically, cheaper NFTs will be from less established projects. This is excellent for investors as it makes it possible to get involved with a project early in its lifecycle. While even the cheapest Bored Ape NFT is expensive as it&#8217;s a well-known collection, there are plenty of cheap NFT collections that simply haven&#8217;t had time to mature into their full potential.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ve taken a look at 12 of the best cheap NFTs to buy and discussed the validity of NFTs as an investment. During our research, we came across one project that presented itself as the best cheap NFT to buy.</p><p>IMPT is a new NFT project that is racing through its token presale amid huge hype because of its real-world use case in an urgent &#8211; and rapidly growing industry.</p><p>IMPT NFTs will help users offset their carbon footprints and fight the climate crisis, while the carbon credit market could increase 50 times in the next decade.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/"><strong>Visit IMPT Presale</strong></a></p><h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>What is the cheapest an NFT can sell for?</strong></p><p>Technically, there is no lowest price that an NFT can sell for. A few of the collections we&#8217;ve looked at have a floor price of just 0.001 ETH ($1.30). However, depending on the blockchain an NFT is created on, gas fees can end up being more costly than the NFT itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Which NFTs should I buy cheap?</strong></p><p>There are plenty of different cheap NFTs to buy now. However, not all of the collections will be worth purchasing. A few of our favorite cheap NFTs include IMPT and Tamadoge. Both projects have performed well thus far and present no signs of slowing up anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the cheapest NFT&nbsp;collections?</strong></p><p>The price for an NFT collection varies massively. Some collections, particularly those involved with P2E gaming, could have a low floor price due to having a common item within the collection while the average sale price is far higher. With that said, the Indifferent Duck had a floor price of 0.001 ETH making it the cheapest NFT on our list. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you buy an NFT&nbsp;for $20?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s entirely possible to purchase an NFT for $20 or even below, in fact, most of the collections we&#8217;ve mentioned can be purchased for less than $20. However, while cheap NFTs can make for good investments, it&#8217;s crucial to perform ample research prior to investing in a project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

We&#8217;ve included a variety of collections with a diverse range of goals in order to appeal to investors of every preference.</p><p>Investors looking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/make-money-with-nfts.htm">make money with NFTs</a> will often search for the coolest NFTs on the market. Let&#8217;s explore some of the best NFTs to consider in 2023. &nbsp;</p><h3>1. Tamadoge &#8211; The Overall Coolest NFT Project to Invest in</h3><p><a href="https://gridglass48.co/box_90da238324b03fa24c3099914aa14f50">Tamadoge (TAMA)</a> is a project focused on creating a cryptocurrency game that engages with users and rewards them for their gameplay. In order to create a strong ecosystem, Tamadoge has taken aspects from the Metaverse, NFTs, and meme coins in order to create a project with strong branding and innovative technology that resonates with crypto enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227520/tama-splash.jpg" alt="tamadoge splash" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227520/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_835_627.jpg 835w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227520/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_720_540.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227520/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_600_450.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227520/responsive-images/tama-splash___media_library_original_300_225.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="835" class="content-img"></figure><p>The project allows users to explore a detailed virtual world known as the Tamaverse. Within this expansive world, it&#8217;s possible to see and interact with NFT-based 3D-animated Tamadoge pets. In order to increase their leaderboard ranking, a player can level up a pet using items available from the in-game store.</p><p>The players ranked the highest on the in-game leaderboard are entitled to the largest share of the P2E rewards pool which is distributed monthly. This incentives players to improve their pets, triggering the 5% burn mechanism on revenue generated from the Tamadoge store. This increases the scarcity of the TAMA token, slowly boosting the asset&#8217;s value.&nbsp;</p><p>Tamadoge managed to sell out its $19 million presale far ahead of schedule before exploding upon its OKX listing, rising in value from its $0.03 listing price to $0.197 at its peak, causing TAMA to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-cheap-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cheap cryptos to buy</a>. However, this is likely only the start for TAMA.</p><p>&nbsp;On October 6th, the first Tamadoge pet NFT collection was released consisting of 100 ultra-rare NFTs. This will soon be followed by the release of a further 1,000 rare and 20,000 common Tamadoge pets making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/upcoming-nfts.htm">best upcoming NFT drops</a> in 2023. With TAMA shooting up in value by more than 600% upon an exchange listing, it&#8217;ll be exciting to see where the price heads following the release of the project&#8217;s core features.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227521/tama-nfts-min.jpg" alt="tamadoge nfts" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227521/responsive-images/tama-nfts-min___media_library_original_1325_924.jpg 1325w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227521/responsive-images/tama-nfts-min___media_library_original_1200_836.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227521/responsive-images/tama-nfts-min___media_library_original_900_627.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227521/responsive-images/tama-nfts-min___media_library_original_720_502.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227521/responsive-images/tama-nfts-min___media_library_original_600_418.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227521/responsive-images/tama-nfts-min___media_library_original_300_209.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1325" class="content-img"></figure><p>Tamadoge has already been one of the year&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> and now with the release of its NFT collections, Tamdaoge is perhaps the coolest NFT project too. With the ultra-rare collection selling out quickly, it&#8217;s the perfect time to check the project out. &nbsp;</p><p>Join the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram</a> to stay informed of the latest updates.

IMPT &#8211; Green Crypto &nbsp;Improving the Carbon Reduction Sector Using NFTs</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/">IMPT</a> is a project focused on reducing the carbon output of individuals and companies via the tokenization of carbon credits. This concept has proven to be a big hit with investors. On October 3rd, IMPT launched the first phase of its presale, raising over $4 million within less than two weeks, showing that there is a clear demand for IMPT&#8217;s services.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227525/impt-splash-2.jpg" alt="impt splash" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227525/responsive-images/impt-splash-2___media_library_original_828_459.jpg 828w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227525/responsive-images/impt-splash-2___media_library_original_720_399.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227525/responsive-images/impt-splash-2___media_library_original_600_332.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227525/responsive-images/impt-splash-2___media_library_original_300_166.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="828" class="content-img"></figure><p>By turning carbon credits into NFTs, this leading <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/utility-nft-projects.htm">utility NFT project</a> has made them verifiable and easy to buy, sell, and trade. This will likely do wonders when it comes to helping spread the concept of carbon credits to crypto investors.&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure that people will have the chance to reduce their carbon output regardless of budgetary restrictions, IMPT has created a system that will allow people to earn IMPT tokens for shopping with a long list of brands. These IMPT tokens can then be exchanged for carbon credits, which, in turn, can be redeemed to offset carbon, exchanged for an NFT, or sold.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to directly purchasing carbon credits, a brand can also work with IMPT to link its storefront to the platform and allocate a portion of its margin to environmental projects certified by IMPT and audited by a third party.&nbsp;</p><p>The voluntary and mandatory carbon offset markets with a combined $273 billion, with this figure expected to grow exponentially over the coming years. As IMPT improves upon the services offered by other companies in the market, we could see IMPT grow to a multi-billion dollar market cap far sooner than most would expect.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227524/impt-nft-marketplace.jpg" alt="green NFT marketplace IMPT" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227524/responsive-images/impt-nft-marketplace___media_library_original_811_462.jpg 811w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227524/responsive-images/impt-nft-marketplace___media_library_original_720_410.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227524/responsive-images/impt-nft-marketplace___media_library_original_600_341.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227524/responsive-images/impt-nft-marketplace___media_library_original_300_170.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="811" class="content-img"></figure><p>As stated in the <a href="https://impt.io/assets/documents/WHITEPAPER.pdf">IMPT whitepaper</a>, the project&#8217;s presale will take place across three phases. The first will see 600 million tokens sell for $0.018, the second will be for 660 million tokens at $0.23 a piece, and the third will contain the remaining 540 million tokens at a cost of $0.028.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, IMPT is an extremely interesting project that is likely to prove very popular with environmental or sustainability-focused investors. As the IMPT presale Is selling out quickly, it&#8217;s worth checking out the project today before prices increase during the second presale phase. Join the <a href="https://t.me/s/IMPTprogram">IMPT Telegram group</a> to stay informed about the presale&#8217;s progress.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/"><strong>&nbsp;Visit IMPT Presale</strong></a></p><h3>3. Battle Infinity &#8211; Diverse Ecosystem of NFT and DeFi-Based Features</h3><p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity (IBAT)</a> is a popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-nft-projects.htm">metaverse NFT project</a> that has created an ecosystem consisting of a wide range of NFT and DeFi-based features. The project has done well since it was released. The Battle Infinity presale sold out 65 days early and the IBAT token increased in value by close to 400% after its listing on PancakeSwap.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227522/ibat-premier-league.jpg" alt="IBAT premier league" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227522/responsive-images/ibat-premier-league___media_library_original_1218_985.jpg 1218w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227522/responsive-images/ibat-premier-league___media_library_original_1200_970.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227522/responsive-images/ibat-premier-league___media_library_original_900_727.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227522/responsive-images/ibat-premier-league___media_library_original_720_582.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227522/responsive-images/ibat-premier-league___media_library_original_600_485.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227522/responsive-images/ibat-premier-league___media_library_original_300_242.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1218" class="content-img"></figure><p>As Battle Infinity consists of a variety of features, the ecosystem is split into six different platforms. The IBAT Premier League (an NFT-based fantasy sports league), an NFT Marketplace (with minting capabilities), a decentralized exchange, a collection of P2E NFT games, a metaverse arena, and even a dedicated staking platform with over $4 million total value locked (TLV).</p><p>To make it simple for users to buy and sell items within the Battle Infinity ecosystem, the team has opted to tokenize key items, turning them into NFTs. For example, to participate in a fantasy sports league, a user will need to purchase an NFT pass. After doing so they are awarded a budget to build a team. Winning passes can be sold on the in-built NFT marketplace.</p><p>The IBAT token has a variety of uses within the Battle Infinity ecosystem, making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> on the market. Thanks to its use of the BEP-20 token architecture, IBAT benefits from fast settlement, low fees, and an adjustable tax used to facilitate listings on centralized exchanges (CEX).&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227523/ibat-tokenomics.jpg" alt="IBAT Tokenomics" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90769/227523/responsive-images/ibat-tokenomics___media_library_original_1029_573.jpg 1029w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227523/responsive-images/ibat-tokenomics___media_library_original_900_501.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227523/responsive-images/ibat-tokenomics___media_library_original_720_400.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227523/responsive-images/ibat-tokenomics___media_library_original_600_334.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90769/227523/responsive-images/ibat-tokenomics___media_library_original_300_167.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1029" class="content-img"></figure><p>As an early-stage project, the majority of Battle Infinity&#8217;s core features are let to be released. As the launch of its staking platform was met with widespread praise and noticeably boosted demand for IBAT, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see where the price of IBAT heads once the full Battle Infinity ecosystem is available to users.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Battle Infinity is a very cool NFT project that has the potential to perform very well over the long term.
