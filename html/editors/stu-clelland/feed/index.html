a true low-cap gem.</p><p>When a project has a very low market cap, like Burn Kenny, this leaves plenty of room for explosive upside for early investors.</p><p>And meme coin degens have a unique opportunity here to be one of those early investors.</p><h3>$KENNY: The Deflationary Token Shaking Up the Market</h3><p>Recent success story Mr Hankey Coin raised $500,000 in a presale that valued its coin at $1.25 million.</p><p>But Burn Kenny Coin is going one step further than Mr Hankey Coin did to bring value to the investor.</p><p>In-fitting with its name, Burn Kenny Coin has an in-built burn mechanism designed to create deflation and lift the $KENNY price over time.</p><p>To achieve this, 30% of the token supply has been set aside for future token burns.</p><p>Unlike many deflationary token designs that burn, sometimes intermittently, over long periods, Burn Kenny Coin takes a different and probably more profitable one for its coin buyers and holders &ndash; the burn mechanism kicks in 24 hours after the DEX listing and lasts for just three days.&nbsp;</p><h3>Three-Month DEX Liquidity Lock Accounts for 30% of Allocation</h3><p>The remaining 30% of the $KENNY supply is dedicated to decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity.</p><p>That&rsquo;s important because, in the absence of plentiful liquidity, meme coin degens often face the hurdle of inefficient buying and selling and significant potential losses due to price slippage.</p><p>Significantly, Burn Kenny Coin&rsquo;s team has also pledged to lock this liquidity for three months, ensuring that there is no rug pull.</p><p>Allocating such a large percentage of a new meme token&rsquo;s supply to a DEX liquidity lock is a rare move in the scam-ridden meme coin space and should help bolster confidence in the project.</p><h2>Experienced Marketing Team Known for Generating Market Surges</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>It&rsquo;s understood that Burn Kenny Coin is actually being launched by the very same marketing team that brought us not just Mr Hankey Coin but also Thug Life Token ($THUG) and SpongeBob ($SPONGE), which recently did 3x and 100x gains, respectively.</p><p>The marketing team in question was able to pull off these remarkable feats by securing partnerships with dozens of influencers and reputable crypto news websites.</p><p>Expect them to have similar success in spreading the word far and wide regarding Burn Kenny Coin.</p><p>In fact, the team&rsquo;s efforts are already evident.</p><p>All you have to do is type Burn Kenny Coin into Google search, and you will see websites such as <a href="https://finbold.com/burn-kenny-crypto-presale-to-begin-today-with-traders-backing-the-new-meme-coin-to-explode/">Finbold</a>,<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/market-releases/3-new-cryptocurrency-ico-launches-today-burn-kenny-evil-pepe-coin-btc20"> Cointelegraph</a>,<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/burn-kenny-ico-launch-generating-excitement-following-success-of-fellow-south-park-token-mr-hankey-coin/"> CryptoPotato</a>,<a href="https://coingape.com/sponsored/deflationary-crypto-token-burn-kenny-kenny-begins-ico-today/"> Coingape</a>,<a href="https://news.cision.com/finance-pr/r/omg-they-burned-kenny---new-south-park-crypto-presale-launching-soon--will-it-3x-like-mr-hankey-coin,c3807299"> Cision</a>, and many more covering the token.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>YouTubers are also already on the bandwagon, with one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xHcMiFGPqg&amp;pp=ygUQYnVybiBrZW5ueSBqYWNvYg%3D%3D">crypto expert predicting substantial return on investment</a> for $KENNY buyers.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the team&rsquo;s track record in delivering impressive meme coin pumps, there is a strong likelihood of $KENNY achieving at least 3x gains.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/burnkenny">Buy Burn Kenny Coin Here</a></p><h2>Kenny Token Presale May Reach Capacity in Just 5 Hours</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Meme coin degens should not wait around to buy.</p><p>The Burn Kenny Coin presale is expected to sell out even faster than Mr Hankey Coin &ndash; perhaps in as little as 5 hours.</p><p>Head over to the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/burnkenny"> Burn Kenny website</a> now, where you can click through to become a follower of the<a href="https://twitter.com/BurnKennyCoin"> Twitter account</a> and join the<a href="https://t.me/BurnKennyOfficial"> Telegram channel</a>, so you will be first to know when the presale starts.&nbsp;</p><p>To buy $KENNY in presale, you will need Ethereum.</p><p>Connect your wallet at<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/burnkenny"> https://burnkenny.vip/</a>, set how much you wish to buy, approve the connection and purchase, and you are done.</p><p>Return to the site and claim your tokens after the presale has concluded.</p><p>Buy $KENNY on the sly before the rest of the world wakes up, and you could bag the easiest 3x, or more, opportunity in crypto.</p>

Well, BTC20 provides new entrants with precisely that opportunity.</p><p>BTC20 has turned back the bitcoin blockchain to 2011, which means you can buy the coin for $1. BTC20 is mirroring the block production and minting process of the years since 2011 by building it into the design of its novel staking system, in which token holders can earn up to 65% APY.</p><p>The crypto community is sitting up and taking notice of BTC20. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/new-cryptocurrency-btc20-launches-token-presale-the-erc-20-bitcoin/">Beincrypto</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/market-releases/5-new-upcoming-binance-listings-rumored-for-2023">Cointelegraph</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/sponsored/btc20-crypto-begins-public-presale-the-eco-friendly-bitcoin-alternative/">Coingape</a>, and <a href="https://finbold.com/new-btc20-crypto-presale-launches-with-stake-to-earn-rewards-will-it-explode-like-the-bitcoin-price/">Finbold</a> have all featured the coin. YouTubers are starting to pick up on the coin, too, with German crypto trading channel <a href="https://youtu.be/tWbaCaDqf2A">Smallcap DE predicting outsized returns</a> when BTC20 lists.&nbsp;</p><h2>BTC20 gains could range from 81,000% to 3,000,000%</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><br>If you had bought bitcoin in 2011 and held it until today, you would be sitting on a gain of 3,000,000%. Although it might sound fanciful to be able to repeat such a parabolic move, there&rsquo;s an as-yet little-known &lsquo;Bitcoin&rsquo; alternative that has returned 81,088% to investors.</p><p>The coin is <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x2cc846fff0b08fb3bffad71f53a60b4b6e6d6482">Harry Potter Obama Sonic 10 Inu</a>, also known as HPOS10I. It is actually a meme coin that uses the ticker $BITCOIN. At the time of writing, it has a market capitalization of $73 million on a price of $0.073 but has traded as high as $0.082 today.</p><p>HPOS10i has gained 81,088%, rising from $0.0001010 on May 10th to an intraday high of $0.08292 on 20th July.</p><p>OK, so that&rsquo;s not quite a 3,000,000% return on investment, but 81,000% is a pretty big number, and, what&#8217;s more, it was achieved in a fraction of the time it has taken bitcoin to deliver those returns for its 2011 buyers.</p><p>There are, of course, more serious imitators of bitcoin that do have a value differential. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), for example, has a much larger block size than bitcoin &ndash; 1MB vs 32 MB. Bitcoin SV (BSV) can have a maximum block size of up to 4GB.</p><p>Bitcoin Cash has seen its price rise on the back of bitcoin&rsquo;s performance and renewed interest from institutional-focused exchange EDX. BCH is 130% higher over the past 30 days.</p><p>$BTC20 plays on the bitcoin clone theme. However, unlike BCH and BSV it is not a fork of the original blockchain but is built on Ethereum.</p><h2>Bitcoin alternative BTC20 token is superior &ndash; more versatile, and powerful</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><br>In many ways, Ethereum is superior to bitcoin, primarily because it can run dApps (decentralized applications) &ndash; or smart contracts. It also recently underwent a major upgrade to transform the network with a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism for verifying blocks.</p><p>This means that Ethereum addition to running dApps, unlike the bitcoin protocol, is also more efficient and uses a fraction of the power consumed by bitcoin&rsquo;s Proof-of-Work-based system.</p><p>BTC20 will be a beneficiary of the association with the bitcoin brand name in the same way as the other bitcoin alternatives mentioned here.</p><p>The new BTC20 cryptocurrency will be much easier to use than bitcoin, and because of its Ethereum provenance, it will become cheaper to use over time as the upgrades of the network continue.</p><p>However, BTC20 has something else going for it that none of the aforementioned bitcoin clone coins have &ndash; staking.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/120151/318954/btc20-presale-bitcoin-on-.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/120151/318954/responsive-images/btc20-presale-bitcoin-on-___media_library_original_1026_1026.jpeg 1026w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318954/responsive-images/btc20-presale-bitcoin-on-___media_library_original_900_900.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318954/responsive-images/btc20-presale-bitcoin-on-___media_library_original_720_720.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318954/responsive-images/btc20-presale-bitcoin-on-___media_library_original_600_600.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318954/responsive-images/btc20-presale-bitcoin-on-___media_library_original_300_300.jpeg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1026" class="content-img"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f539.png" alt="🔹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> $BTC20: User-friendly and powerful <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>$BTC20 is built on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a>, the most-used <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Blockchain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Blockchain</a> after <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>.

BTC20 is keeping the rewards ethos but doing things slightly differently.&nbsp;<br>BTC20 will reward stakers, depending on the proportion of the staking pool they own and the rate of block production of the original bitcoin chain since 2011.&nbsp;<br>This means that the number of holders staking has no bearing on the size of the token unlock. Here are some examples:</p><p><br><strong>Example 1</strong>&nbsp;<br>If 6 BTC20 were to be unlocked, with an assumed staking pool of 100,000 BTC20, and you were staking 20,000 BTC20, you would receive one-fifth of the rewards. In this example, your earnings would be 1.2 BTC20 tokens.</p><p><strong>Example 2</strong><br>Assuming the following:<br>User stakes for 1 year<br>Rewards are at their current levels (6.25 BTC20 per block)<br>Around 50,000 blocks are &lsquo;mined&rsquo; per year<br>User stakes 5,000 BTC20<br>The total staking pool is 500,000 BTC20<br>In example 2, the holder would have 1% of the pool so would accrue rewards of 3285 BTC20 over 12 months, which equates to an annual percentage yield (APY) of 65.7% &ndash; see screenshot below:</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/120151/318955/untitled.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/120151/318955/responsive-images/untitled___media_library_original_1600_338.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318955/responsive-images/untitled___media_library_original_1200_254.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318955/responsive-images/untitled___media_library_original_900_190.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318955/responsive-images/untitled___media_library_original_720_152.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318955/responsive-images/untitled___media_library_original_600_127.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/120151/318955/responsive-images/untitled___media_library_original_300_63.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1600" class="content-img"></figure><h2>BTC20 to get price pump from bitcoin&rsquo;s 4-yearly halving rally</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/120151/318957/plan-b-bitcoin-halving-10.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="" class="content-img"></figure><p><br>&lsquo;Halving&rsquo; refers to the 50% cut in block rewards for bitcoin miners that occurs every four years as part of the way the protocol was designed, slowing down the emission of new coins. The next halving takes place on April 26th, 2024.</p><p>As the chart above shows, bitcoin could rally past $50,000 next year if past performance serves as a guide.</p><p>Over the previous cycle, the run-up to the halving date has always seen the price of bitcoin rise dramatically. This cycle will, in all probability, be no different. Rewards will halve from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.&nbsp;</p><h2>$BTC20 could reach its soft cap target of $3 million very soon</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><br>The BTC20 presale has a soft cap of $3 million but an oversupply option of a second tranche &ndash; $3,050,000.</p><p>Instead of waiting for the possibility of that second stage, buyers who have done their research may wish to get in on the action now to avoid disappointment because the initial $3 million target could be hit early next week.</p><p>The crypto market is consolidating before what could be the start of the bitcoin halving rally, so there couldn&#8217;t be a better time to get into the market.</p><p>Of course, never invest what you can&#8217;t afford to lose. With that caveat emptor warning under your belt, loading up on BTC20 &nbsp;is the perfect &ndash; and only &ndash; way to get back into bitcoin at $1.</p><p>To buy BTC20, head over to the website and pay in Ethereum or USDT by simply connecting your crypto wallet.<br>&nbsp;</p>

This equates to about 5,000 users given the company&#8217;s claim to have around five million clients. But, in the volatile realm of cryptocurrency, even such a small percentage can translate to significant monetary losses.</p><h2>Lazarus Connection: North Korea Rears Its Head Once More</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Elliptic, known for its advanced tracking and security analysis in the crypto space, has indicated that the Lazarus Group is behind this breach.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lazarus Group, which is allegedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-korean-crypto-hackers-targeted-s-korean-ministers-what-do-we-know.htm">connected to North Korea</a>, has an infamous reputation in the crypto community, having stolen over $2 billion in digital assets across multiple attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>If the attribution stands, this will be the first major crypto theft linked to the group since the <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/resources/harmony-horizon-bridge-hack">$100 million Horizon Bridge exploit</a> in June 2022.</p><p>Since then, Elliptic has been working relentlessly to recover the stolen assets. Collaborating with numerous investigators and exchanges worldwide, the company has managed to trace and freeze more than $1 million in stolen assets.</p><p>In response to these events, renowned cybersecurity and crypto expert, Dr. Sarah Brown, commented, &#8220;This recent breach is a stark reminder of the ongoing risks in the cryptocurrency market. It also illustrates the essential need for advanced security protocols and constant vigilance on the part of all stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><p>The crypto industry, while offering immense possibilities, is still a field where security breaches can lead to significant financial losses.&#8221;</p><p>She further emphasized, &#8220;The swift response and efforts of digital forensics companies like Elliptic, in tracking and freezing stolen assets, show that we are becoming more adept at navigating these challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Nonetheless, individual users need to stay informed and cautious, especially in choosing their storage platforms and exchanges.&#8221;</p><h2>Atomic Wallet Goes Dark As Clients Wait And Hope</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Those affected have taken to social media to voice their dismay both at the theft and at Atomic Wallet&#8217;s apparent lack of action and communication in the aftermath of the breach.<br>&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#8217;m a teacher. my life savings was stolen from me! &#8220;1%&#8221; makes it feel like its no big deal -I just want you to know that that 20k may feel small to you, but it was years of work to me.I don&#8217;t feel like you are even worried about me.

Notably, Garantex was sanctioned by the US Department of the Treasury in April 2022 for its role in facilitating the laundering of funds derived from ransomware and darknet markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the sanctions, the exchange continues to function.</p><p>Thanks to Elliptic&#8217;s exhaustive research and unique intelligence on crypto wallets used by Garantex, customers can steer clear of transacting with this sanctioned entity.&nbsp;</p><p>The cybersecurity firm&#8217;s response to this incident serves as a strong testament to the digital forensics capabilities available in the crypto space, helping to maintain trust in an industry that&#8217;s still gaining its footing in the mainstream market.</p><p>CryptoNews.com has reached out to Atomic Wallet and Eliptic for comment.</p>
