<p>Bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain has <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-purchases-18-eh-s-and-secures-long-term-supply-of-hash-rate-from-microbt/">announced</a> its purchase of 66,560 bitcoin mining rigs from MicroBT, marking one of the largest orders in the company&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Riot Blockchain is set to acquire 66,560 Bitcoin miners from manufacturer MicroBT in one of its largest orders of hash rate, totaling $290.5 million, with an average cost of $4,360 per machine. The new order is an extension of Riot&#8217;s initial agreement with MicroBT, where it agreed to buy 33,280 machines in June. The updated agreement now provides Riot with options to purchase up to 265,000 additional miners from MicroBT under the same terms as the recent order.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24Riot&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$Riot</a> Exercises Purchase Option on 18 EH/s of Latest Generation Immersion Miners from MicroBT, and Secures Additional Purchase Options Providing a Path to Exceed 100 EH/s.</p>
<p>&#8211; Riot places order for 18 EH/s of latest generation MicroBT Bitcoin miners, primarily consisting of the… <a href="https://t.co/tEEudV6Z8n">pic.twitter.com/tEEudV6Z8n</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Riot Platforms, Inc. (@RiotPlatforms) <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotPlatforms/status/1731675595275190753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The new miners, primarily consisting of MicroBT&#8217;s M66S model with a hash rate of 250 terahashes per second (TH/s), will add 18 exahashes per second (EH/s) to Riot&#8217;s operations. The deployment schedule includes the previously announced order of 33,280 MicroBT miners, set to begin deployment in the first quarter of 2024, and the new order of 66,560 additional miners, with delivery and deployment starting in the second half of 2024. </p>
<p>By the second half of 2025, the deployment of all miners under the current purchase orders is expected to be completed. Notably, the new miners will be manufactured in the United States and purpose-built for immersion cooling. The average price for all miners in the deal is approximately $16 per terahash.</p>
<p>Riot&#8217;s CEO, Jason Les, noted that this purchase order represents the largest order of hash rate in the company&#8217;s history. He said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This purchase order and updated Agreement ensure that we will continue to own and operate one of the largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining fleets in the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, the agreement aims to strengthen Riot&#8217;s mining performance. Of the newly acquired machines, 72% will be MicroBT&#8217;s latest model, the M66S, and the remaining machines include the M66 (14,770) and M56S++ (3,720) models.</p>
<p>Riot anticipates reaching a self-mining hash rate capacity of 38 EH/s once all 99,840 rigs are fully installed and operational. The company cited the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 as a key factor influencing its recent buying spree. According to Nasdaq, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/riot">Riot&#8217;s stock (ticker: RIOT)</a> increased nearly 9% on December 4, bringing its total gains to over 345% for the year 2023.</p>
<h2>Riot Blockchain Reports Improved Q3 Results Despite Missing Estimates</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On November 9, Bitcoin mining company Riot Blockchain released its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/riot-platforms-reports-q3-results-generates-1106-bitcoins-and-raises-over-200-million.htm">financial report for the third quarter</a>, revealing notable improvements despite falling short of earnings and sales estimates.</p>
<p>During Q3, Riot Platforms produced 1,106 bitcoins, reflecting an increase compared to the same period in 2022, when it generated 1,042 bitcoins. The rise in Bitcoin production was attributed to an increase in deployed miners. However, it was partially offset by higher curtailment due to the company&#8217;s power strategy and the growing difficulty of the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Riot Platforms experienced a significant surge in total revenue, reaching $51.9 million compared to $46.3 million in the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by higher Bitcoin production and elevated average Bitcoin prices, which averaged $28,230 per bitcoin for the quarter—a 33% increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>However, the company missed the analyst consensus estimate for revenue, falling short by 33.03% with a total revenue of $51.9 million. The average cost to mine Bitcoin for Riot Platforms improved, standing at $6,141 during Q3, compared to $8,227 per Bitcoin in the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>Riot Platforms also earned $49.6 million in power curtailment credits, a substantial increase from the $13.1 million earned in the same quarter of the previous year. As of late September, Riot has $442.3 million in working capital, including $290.1 million in cash and 7,327 unencumbered Bitcoins, valued at approximately $197.6 million based on a market price of $26,968 per coin.</p>

<p>Former Paxful CEO Ray Youssef has been appointed as CEO of Noones, a financial communication app aimed at integrating the Global South into the world&#8217;s financial systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/noonesafrica/status/1731698277236588892?s=20">Noones</a> has announced the appointment of Ray Youssef as its CEO following its official launch, which aims to achieve a billion daily active users of Bitcoin within the next seven years.</p>
<p>Noones, founded in 2023, focuses on empowering financial freedom in the Global South. The platform facilitates the fast and frictionless movement of money, eliminating the bottlenecks associated with traditional banking.</p>
<p>With a belief in the peer-to-peer system as the world&#8217;s only true free market and Bitcoin as the new global financial architecture, Noones aims to uplift people in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/twitter-founder-jack-dorseys-crypto-firm-partners-with-paxfuls-ray-youssef-for-p2p-marketplace-venture.htm">Youssef&#8217;s appointment</a> comes as Noones seeks to position itself as a leading financial communication app for users in emerging markets, emphasizing the transformative potential of Bitcoin in fostering financial inclusion and empowerment.</p>
<p>Ray Youssef brings a wealth of experience in strategic planning, product innovation, growth hacking, and operations management to Noones. As the former CEO of Paxful, he played a pivotal role in leading the company to unprecedented heights.</p>
<p>Youssef is also known for co-founding the Built with Bitcoin Foundation, aiming to build 100 communities across Africa to improve physical, mental, environmental, and financial health for the underserved.</p>
<h2><b>Paxful Faces Closure Amidst Legal Dispute Between Co-Founders Youssef and Shaback</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On the 17th of April, Youssef left Paxful after a dispute with co-founder Artur Shaback, and he has since been involved in various initiatives, including co-authoring CivKit, designed to provide a blueprint for a censorship-resistant and permissionless global marketplace.</p>
<p>The same month, Paxful unexpectedly shut down its marketplace. This decision came amid a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-ecosystem-loses-another-p2p-marketplace-as-paxful-shuts-down-end-of-an-era.htm">broader trend</a> in the peer-to-peer market, with rival LocalBitcoins also closing. The peer-to-peer market faced challenges due to regulatory conditions, contributing to the closure of prominent platforms.</p>
<p>However, Ray Youssef attributed the closure to a lawsuit filed by his co-founder, Artur Shaback. Youssef claimed that the legal action, which he characterized as driven by Shaback&#8217;s desire for a substantial financial gain, led to the departure of the senior-level team at Paxful. Youssef argued that Shaback sued him to secure a nine-figure payday in the event of the company&#8217;s dissolution.</p>
<p>In response, Shaback explained that the legal dispute arose from differences in business direction and governance. He accused Youssef of migrating Paxful&#8217;s intellectual property (IP), userbase, wallet history, and passwords to a new venture called Noones. Shaback noted that Youssef could not take him with him due to his status as a U.S. resident.</p>
<h2><b>Noones Aims to Empower Users Through Decentralized and Borderless Financial Opportunities</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Youssef announced plans to reopen peer-to-peer trading through his CivKit initiative, emphasizing a &#8220;Know-Your-Peer&#8221; approach instead of traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC), it&#8217;s mentioned that Noones still requires a KYC onboarding process. Shaback later stated that Paxful was back in operation, led by a Delaware lawyer.</p>
<p>Despite previous disputes and legal issues related to Paxful, Youssef&#8217;s focus remains on leveraging Bitcoin to eradicate poverty and provide the Global South with a more significant voice in the world&#8217;s financial ecosystem. Noones aims to simplify financial transactions and empower users through decentralized and borderless opportunities.</p>
<p>Ray Youssef expressed confidence that Bitcoin will play a crucial role in promoting prosperity in the Global South. He stated that Noones&#8217; first major goal is to create an interoperable pan-African clearing layer to boost intra-African trade.</p>
<p>He said in a statement:<br />
“For the past 8 years, I have fought for financial sovereignty for the Global South. I&#8217;m confident that Bitcoin will play a crucial role in promoting the prosperity of our continent. Our first major goal will be to create an interoperable pan-African clearing layer, taking intra-African trade from the single digits to levels comparable to intra-European trade.”</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UV08IZekMSKycCylGE25GydoIil8r2o1/view">report from Bybit Research</a> reveals insights into the sentiment and asset allocation of institutional traders in the cryptocurrency market during the first three quarters of 2023.</p>
<p>The Bybit Research report delves into the asset allocation strategies of different cohorts, namely institutions, VIPs, and retail traders, amidst the volatile market environment since December 2022.</p>
<p>The findings reveal that institutions are displaying a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-traders-remain-bullish-despite-recent-dips-here-are-key-levels-to-watch.htm">strong preference for Bitcoin</a> (BTC) over Ethereum (ETH) or altcoins, with approximately half of their portfolio allocated to Bitcoin. Notably, institutions increased their Bitcoin holdings during the volatile market conditions of 2023, a trend distinct from other user groups.</p>
<p>Institutional traders nearly doubled their Bitcoin holdings during the initial three quarters of 2023, and as of September, around 50% of their assets were denominated in Bitcoin. The report attributes this bullish stance to positive market sentiment and the anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p>On the other hand, retail traders exhibited lower Bitcoin holdings, potentially influenced by higher leverage levels in their trading activities. The report provides insights into the differentiated approaches and preferences of various market participants amid the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<h2><b>Institutional Traders Show Skepticism Towards Altcoins, Favoring Bitcoin and Ether</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The report from Bybit Research sheds light on the asset allocation strategies of institutional traders and large Bitcoin holders (whales) in the cryptocurrency market. The findings reveal a general decline in altcoin holdings among traders, with a noticeable decrease starting in August.</p>
<p>Institutional traders adopted a cautious stance, with their asset allocation strategy consisting of 45% in stablecoins, 50% strategically invested in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-breaks-through-42000-up-6-6-in-24-hours.htm">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and Ethereum (ETH), and 5% dedicated to altcoins. This skepticism toward altcoins, particularly among institutional investors, is attributed to concerns about the volatility of these alternative assets.</p>
<p>Despite a general decline in Ether holdings since the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s Shapella upgrade, there was a surge in institutional traders&#8217; Ether holdings in September. This coincided with positive market sentiment driven by excitement over ETF news.</p>
<p>The report suggests that institutional traders remain bullish on Bitcoin, express skepticism toward altcoins, and have mixed sentiments regarding Ether. The research highlights a shifting stance on asset allocation, emphasizing a pivot back to Bitcoin over Ether, influenced by Ether&#8217;s prolonged slump against BTC and a muted response to newly launched futures-based ETH ETFs.</p>
<p>The data for the research report was generated based on Bybit&#8217;s active user base from December 2022 to September 2023, with VIP traders defined as investors holding portfolios worth more than $50,000.</p>
<h2><b>Bybit Research Unveils Institutional and Retail Trader Strategies in Bull and Bear Markets</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The research conducted by Bybit reveals distinctive asset allocation strategies among active users, defined as those conducting more than 20 monthly trades. These findings shed light on nuanced patterns during both bullish and bearish market conditions.</p>
<p>One notable trend is the substantial increase in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/just-in-billionaire-michael-saylor-purchases-a-further-593-million-in-bitcoin-total-holdings-now-exceeding-5-billion.htm">Bitcoin holdings by institutional traders</a> during positive market sentiments. This stands in contrast to retail traders, who exhibited lower Bitcoin holdings, potentially linked to their higher levels of leverage.</p>
<p>Retail traders consistently maintained a higher percentage of stablecoins, likely influenced by their leverage practices. During bull markets, they tended to decrease their stablecoin holdings, while in bearish or uncertain markets, an inclination to increase stablecoin holdings was observed.</p>
<p>Institutional holders, on the other hand, displayed a decrease in stablecoin percentage during bearish markets and an increase during bullish markets, suggesting potentially successful market timing.</p>

<p>The team behind KyberSwap announced that it would offer grants from the protocol&#8217;s treasury to victims of the recent exploit, aiming to provide monetary relief.</p>
<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the team behind KyberSwap reiterates its unwavering commitment to supporting law enforcement and cybersecurity efforts to track down the exploiter and recover users&#8217; funds.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In relation to the KyberSwap Elastic incident that transpired from 22 November 2023, 10:54:09 PM UTC, resulting in the exploitative swaps by the exploiter that drained approximately $48.8 million of users’ funds from KyberSwap Elastic liquidity pools, we reiterate our unwavering…</p>
<p>&mdash; Kyber Network (@KyberNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1730631569872916534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The team discloses its intention to provide compensation to users who fell victim to the exploitative actions that drained users&#8217; funds from the platform.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/KyberNetwork/status/1730631569872916534?s=20">public statement</a>, KyberSwap emphasized its dedication to supporting users during this challenging period and acknowledged the ongoing concerns of those who suffered losses due to the exploit.</p>
<p>The decentralized finance protocol suffered a substantial exploit on November 22, where an exploiter drained approximately $48.8 million from users&#8217; funds in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-exploited-in-46-million-attack-due-to-infinite-money-glitch.htm">KyberSwap Elastic liquidity pools</a>.</p>
<p>The team acknowledges the concerns of users, especially those facing hardships due to the exploit. Despite KyberSwap Elastic being a decentralized and permissionless protocol where users accept the risk, KyberSwap aims to ease the hardship faced by affected users.</p>
<p>As part of its commitment, KyberSwap plans to provide grants from the KyberSwap Treasury to users who lost funds in the exploit and have yet to recover them. The proposed grant is intended to be up to the USD value of the funds at the time of the exploit.</p>
<p>The details of this Treasury grant are currently being worked out, and KyberSwap will announce more information within the next two weeks. The company remains committed to transparency and supporting affected users during this challenging period.</p>
<h2><b>KyberSwap Recovers $4.7 Million Following $48.8 Million Exploit; Hacker Demands Control Over Project</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investigations into the exploit have revealed that the vulnerability lay in the tick interval boundaries of KyberSwap&#8217;s concentrated liquidity pools. This flaw allowed an attacker to artificially inflate the liquidity, leading to a significant drain of funds. The hacker specifically targeted KyberSwap&#8217;s elastic pools, affecting funds across various blockchains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>Initially, the loss was estimated at $47 million, but further analysis confirmed the higher figure of $48.8 million. In an attempt to recover the stolen funds, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">KyberSwap offered the hacker a 10% white-hat hacker reward</a> in exchange for returning the funds. However, the hacker was not interested in accepting the reward and made other demands in a strange on-chain message, including asking the team for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-director-demands-executive-control-and-asset-surrender-in-bold-negotiation-terms.htm">full control over the project</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, KyberSwap has successfully <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-retrieves-4-7-million-after-security-attack.htm">recovered </a><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-retrieves-4-7-million-after-security-attack.htm">$4.7 million</a> of the stolen funds, which were separately taken by third-party MEV bots during the hack. This partial recovery and the proposed Treasury grants reflect the platform&#8217;s proactive approach to addressing security breaches.</p>
<p>According to KyberSwap&#8217;s update, the recovered funds include 361.92 axl-wstETH ($870.5k), 441.8 WETH ($919k), 261.5 wstETH (~$624k), 711,430.9 WMATIC (~$547.8k), 443,011.6 USDT (~$443k), 385,630.7 USDC (~$385.6k), and 65,130 USDT (~$65.1k).</p>
<p>The team hasn&#8217;t yet responded to the explorer&#8217;s latest message on X and is presumably waiting to see the new treaty proposed by the hacker.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the hacker, the attacker said that his goal was to buy KyberSwap cheaply.</p>

<p>Crypto asset manager Grayscale has appointed John Hoffman, former Head of Americas at Invesco, to lead its distribution and partnerships team.</p>
<p>On December 1, Grayscale announced the hiring of John, who has experience with ETFs and index strategies at Invesco. Hoffman, an ETF veteran, brings over 17 years of experience from Invesco, where he played various roles, including leading the Americas, ETF, and indexed strategies teams.</p>
<p>During his time at Invesco, Hoffman held various roles, including director of ETF institutional sales and capital markets. Grayscale&#8217;s Global Head of ETFs, Dave LaValle, expressed excitement about Hoffman joining as Managing Director, emphasizing his wealth of industry and ETF expertise.</p>
<p>Dave LaValle said in a statement,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Grayscale team is thrilled to have John Hoffman join us as managing director and head of distribution and strategic partnerships. John has a wealth of industry and ETF expertise, which will be invaluable to our team and clients, especially during this exciting time at Grayscale.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Invesco Faces Key Departures as Anna Paglia Moves to State Street Global Advisors</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Invesco, a prominent ETF issuer in the United States, is grappling with another significant departure as <a href="https://www.pionline.com/money-management/state-street-hires-invesco-etf-head-anna-paglia-chief-business-officer">Anna Paglia</a>, the global head of ETFs, indexed strategies, separately managed accounts, and models, leaves to join State Street Global Advisors. On November 27, State Street Global Advisors officially announced Paglia&#8217;s appointment as executive vice president and chief business officer, effective early next year.</p>
<p>In response to Paglia&#8217;s departure, Invesco&#8217;s spokeswoman stated that Brian Hartigan, the global head of investments, ETFs, and indexed strategies, will temporarily take on Paglia&#8217;s responsibilities. Simultaneously, the firm is actively searching for a permanent replacement for her role.</p>
<p>Invesco, a major ETF issuer managing over 200 ETFs with approximately $425 billion in assets under management, has seen several key departures recently, reflecting the evolving landscape of the ETF industry. The transition of experienced professionals like Anna Paglia to other major players, such as State Street Global Advisors, underscores the competitive nature of the ETF market and the strategic importance of talent in shaping the success of asset management firms.</p>
<h2><b>Grayscale Investments Makes Strategic Move Ahead of SEC Decision on Spot Bitcoin ETFs</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hoffman&#8217;s arrival comes at a crucial juncture, just six weeks before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">expected</a> to decide on Grayscale&#8217;s proposal to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale is seeking to convert its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-proposes-gbtc-fund-amendment-as-spot-bitcoin-etf-looms.htm">GBTC bitcoin trust</a> into an ETF in January, and its application is among the 13 other potential spot bitcoin ETFs awaiting approval.</p>
<p>The SEC is currently reviewing applications from various asset managers, including WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity, and BlackRock, for spot bitcoin ETFs. Despite the growing interest in these financial products, the SEC still needs to approve any spot crypto ETF applications.</p>
<p>Both Grayscale and BlackRock have recently engaged with the SEC&#8217;s division of trading and markets to discuss their applications for spot bitcoin funds. While a court ruling mandated the SEC to review Grayscale&#8217;s applications, the regulatory agency may still choose to deny them.</p>
<p>The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is highly anticipated, and market participants are speculating that concrete decisions may be made in January 2024. This anticipation has contributed to a surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, with a 12.1% increase over the past month and a remarkable 123.7% rise over the past year. As of the latest update, Bitcoin is trading at $38,415, reflecting a 2.3% increase over the past day.</p>

<p>Crypto startup MoonPay has announced the appointment of Mike Lempres, a former executive from Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), to its board of directors.</p>
<p>On November 30, MoonPay <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/newsroom/mike-lempres-joins-moonpay">announced </a>that Mike Lempres will be joining the company&#8217;s board of directors to provide expertise about their product offerings and the industry&#8217;s regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>Mike Lempres previously served as the Chief Policy Officer at Coinbase and later joined Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) as an executive in residence for over two years. However, he is currently still a board member for Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Silvergate Bank.</p>
<p>Lempres brings a wealth of experience in corporate governance, capital raises, and executive functions, having served on the boards of prominent companies such as Bitstamp, Revolut US (as chair), and Coinbase.</p>
<p>Lempres, known for his contributions to both public and private companies, also has a background in the public sector, having held senior positions across three presidential administrations and serving as the Mayor of Atherton, California.</p>
<p>As Chief Legal &amp; Compliance Officer for Coinbase, Lempres played a significant role in the exchange&#8217;s IPO and growth. His expertise is expected to be valuable for MoonPay as the company navigates evolving product offerings and the regulatory landscape.</p>
<h2><strong>MoonPay Expresses Anticipation for Mike Lempres&#8217; Contribution to Regulatory and Growth Initiatives</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
MoonPay, founded in 2018, offers a range of crypto products and services, including an investment app, payment infrastructure, and an NFT platform. The company was valued at $3.4 billion in late 2021 after a Series A funding round that raised $555 million, led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue.</p>
<p>Besides Lempres, MoonPay&#8217;s other current board members include Soto-Wright, Max Crown, the company&#8217;s chief finance and operating officer, and Theodora Vardis, managing partner at HODL.vc, said Soto-Wright.</p>
<p>MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright expressed the company&#8217;s anticipation of Lempres contributing to various topics and initiatives.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We look forward to leveraging Mike&#8217;s unique experience in navigating regulatory uncertainty as well as his track record for building successful businesses and scaling growth-stage companies. Whether it is his expertise in corporate governance, maturing compliance, and risk management, or his experience in crypto specifically, we expect Mike to contribute on a wide range of topics and initiatives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>MoonPay Adapts to UK Regulations, Plans Migration of Operations to Comply With Travel Rule Requirements</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As regulatory scrutiny in the United States continues to intensify, MoonPay aims to leverage Lempres&#8217;s experience in navigating regulatory challenges and building successful businesses.</p>
<p>Although the government of the United Kingdom has laid out plans to step up regulation of crypto assets in its efforts to respond to economic crime in the country, MoonPay is committed to servicing UK-based customers and is working closely with regulators to understand and implement these changes, ensuring that it is at the forefront of both compliance and customer trust.</p>
<p>In October, MoonPay <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uks-fca-adds-143-crypto-exchanges-including-huobi-owned-htx-and-kucoin-to-warning-list.htm">announced</a> that it is set to migrate its UK operations to MoonPay (UK) Ltd, a cryptoasset business registered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This was done to adapt to the newly imposed Travel Rule requirements within the UK, allowing the company to continue offering our services in compliance with local regulations.</p>

<p>The Australian Department of the Treasury is considering applying sector-specific codes and standards to banking and cryptocurrency scams as part of its proposed framework.</p>
<p>On November 29, a <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-11/c2023-464732-cp.pdf">consultation paper</a> titled &#8220;Proposed Scams Code Framework,&#8221; aimed at establishing a new framework for addressing consumer and business scams, was released by Australia&#8217;s Department of the Treasury. The proposal considers applying sector-specific codes and standards to address various types of scams, including those related to banking and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The consultation paper suggests assigning mandatory industry codes for different types of scams, with a focus on key sectors such as banks, telecommunications providers, and digital communications platforms. Additionally, a category for &#8220;future sectors&#8221; is proposed, which would include cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and related trading platforms and marketplaces.</p>
<p>The goal of the framework is to delegate clear roles and responsibilities to both government and private entities involved in combating scams. It emphasizes the need for measures to prevent, detect, disrupt, and respond to scams, along with the sharing of scam intelligence across and between sectors.</p>
<p>The Treasury&#8217;s proposal comes in response to the increasing prevalence of scams in Australia, with consumers and businesses reportedly losing at least $3.1 billion to scams in 2022—an 80% increase from the previous year. Despite existing initiatives to address scams, the government aims to enhance its efforts with the new framework.</p>
<p>The Treasury is inviting comments on the recently released consultation paper until January 29, 2024. The new framework seeks to enhance existing initiatives to address scams and improve the effectiveness of measures in combating fraudulent activities.</p>
<h2><b>Australia Plans to Regulate Cryptocurrency Exchanges Under Existing Laws</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The country has been actively creating a framework to protect its citizens and refine regulations surrounding cryptocurrency. Rather than introducing new rules exclusively for cryptocurrencies, the regulation of crypto exchanges will fall under existing financial services laws.</p>
<p>In October, Australia&#8217;s Treasury announced plans to release <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-10/c2023-427004-proposal-paper-final.pdf">draft legislation</a> covering licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by 2024. Once the legislation becomes law, digital asset exchanges will have 12 months to transition to the new regulatory framework. The timeline suggests that it could take until 2025 for an Australian digital asset platform to obtain a license under the proposed regime.</p>
<p>This development marks a significant step by the Australian government in formulating a comprehensive crypto regulation policy. The proposal, initially expected by mid-2023 after its announcement in February 2023, outlines that crypto exchanges holding more than AUD 1,500 of any one client or more than AUD 5 million in total assets would require an Australian Financial Services license granted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</p>
<p>The proposal, which addresses 32 themes, invites written submissions by December 1, 2023. The Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia plan to release a joint report around the middle of 2024, offering a comprehensive overview of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/report-australia-explores-cbdc-use-cases-four-key-areas-says-technology-some-years-away.htm">central bank digital currency (CBDC) research in Australia</a> and outlining a roadmap for future work.</p>

<p>The investigation into Tomya, a cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.wearehullcity.co.uk/news/2022/july/tomya-become-back-of-shorts-sponsor/">sponsored</a> by Hull City&#8217;s owner, Acun Ilıcalı, has led to several arrests, including the exchange&#8217;s owner, Yavuz Usta, and economist Ece Pulaş.</p>
<p>The Istanbul Büyükçekmece Public Prosecutor’s Office launched this investigation to uncover potential fraudulent activities. It was triggered by <a href="https://halktv.com.tr/gundem/acunun-takimina-sponsor-olmus-kripto-para-borsasinin-sahibi-10-kisi-ile-785531h">Musa Ekmekçioğlu&#8217;s complaint</a>, alleging he was defrauded of $211,500. The probe has resulted in the detention of 25 individuals, with 11 being referred for arrest.</p>
<p>Ece Pulaş&#8217;s lawyer stated that his client provides consultancy and training in capital markets and does not have any partnership or signing authority with the companies involved in the investigation or Tomya.</p>
<p>He emphasized that Pulaş only conducted training for a short period of about five weeks.</p>
<h2><b>Former Thodex CEO Faces Over 11,000 Years in Turkish Prison as the Country Prepares for Crypto Legislation</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Details on the investigation are emerging as the country prepares to introduce crypto legislation. Turkey recently handed out an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/turkish-crypto-exchange-thodex-ceo-receives-11196-year-jail-term-for-fraud-and-money-laundering.htm">11,196-year sentence to the individuals who ran Thodex</a>, a crypto exchange that suddenly collapsed in 2021.</p>
<p>Thodex was one of Turkey&#8217;s largest crypto exchanges before it suddenly went offline in April 2021, and Özer went missing. Over 400,000 members were left in the dark without access to deposits of $2 billion in cryptocurrencies. Özer had fled to Albania but was arrested in August 2022 after an Interpol red notice was issued against him.</p>
<p>By April 2023, Özer was deported to Turkey and detained by police upon arrival on seven charges, including establishing and managing an organization with the purpose of committing a crime, being a member of an organization, fraud by using information systems as a tool of banks or credit institutions, fraud of merchants or company executives and cooperative managers, and laundering the value of assets resulting from crime.</p>
<p>Despite the Thodex scandal, crypto adoption in the country has yet to show signs of slowing down. According to a research survey conducted by KuCoin, over the last year and a half, crypto adoption has increased from 40 percent to 52 percent of the Turkish population. 71 percent of investors said they own Bitcoin, while 45 percent own Ethereum and other stablecoins.</p>
<p>Also, the Turkish government has been exploring the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) called the Digital Lira, signaling the nation&#8217;s evolving stance on digital finance.</p>
<h2><strong>Turkey Aims to Regulate Crypto Market with a Focus on Licensing and Taxation</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a bid to address concerns raised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and move off the international financial crime watchdog&#8217;s &#8220;grey list,&#8221; Turkey is set to introduce <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/turkey-aims-to-leave-fatf-grey-list-with-proposed-crypto-asset-legislation.htm">new rules to regulate the crypto market</a>. Officials suggest that the regulations are likely to emphasize licensing and taxation, with the goal of preventing abuse of the system and ensuring compliance with FATF recommendations.</p>
<p>Turkey, currently the world&#8217;s fourth-largest crypto-trading country, has experienced a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/turkeys-economic-woes-push-investors-towards-stablecoin-tether-heres-latest.htm">surge in crypto trading</a> amid soaring inflation and a depreciating national currency, the lira, prompting the need for alternative assets. Turkey ranked fourth globally in raw crypto transaction volumes, with approximately $170 billion over the past year.</p>

<p>SoFi Technologies Inc., a financial services company, has decided to exit the cryptocurrency sector due to increased scrutiny by banking regulators.</p>
<p>On November 29, the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/sofi-is-exiting-crypto-with-banking-regulators-stepping-up-scrutiny#xj4y7vzkg">announced</a> that it would terminate its cryptocurrency trading services for users by December 19. The company informed its crypto customers that they would need to liquidate their accounts in the coming weeks or migrate to the crypto exchange and wallet provider Blockchain.com.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOFI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SOFI</a> announces they are exiting crypto. <a href="https://t.co/cz1HXPhg5K">pic.twitter.com/cz1HXPhg5K</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michael McQuaid (@michaelgmcquaid) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgmcquaid/status/1729866201730601208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>They will also be suspending new crypto account openings immediately as their existing SoFi crypto users migrate their accounts to Blockchain.com or close them.</p>
<p>Customers residing in certain states, including Hawaii, Louisiana, New Jersey, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, must liquidate unsupported altcoins through Blockchain.com before transferring accounts.</p>
<p>Additionally, SoFi crypto clients in New York are required to close their accounts by January 2024 due to the unavailability of Blockchain.com in the state. The decision to end crypto services at SoFi does not impact other SoFi Invest offerings, including brokerage accounts and Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).</p>
<p>SoFi, which began as a student-lending refinancing company in 2011, expanded its services over the years and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/why-has-sofi-added-crypto-trading-to-their-platform.htm">entered the crypto space in 2019</a>, allowing users to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin directly through its app.</p>
<p>In its latest earnings report, SoFi revealed that it held $139 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and other altcoins in clients&#8217; deposits, marking an increase from $107 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The decision to work with Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency financial services firm, was attributed to their long-standing work in the crypto industry. Blockchain.com reported tens of thousands of users migrating to its platform in the first hour following the announcement, expecting to welcome hundreds of thousands of customers and hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Joseph Otting, independent director at Blockchain.com and former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, commented that SoFi&#8217;s choice is a testament to Blockchain.com&#8217;s commitment to security and innovation in the financial commerce sector.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;This collaboration will open new doors and opportunities for SoFi members, providing access to a broad range of digital tokens and advanced trading features.&#8221;</p>
<h2><b>SoFi Faces Regulatory Challenges, Decides to Cease Crypto Operations Amidst Uncertainties</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SoFi&#8217;s announcement comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. cryptocurrency industry following actions taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<p>SoFi&#8217;s decision is attributed to regulatory guidance from the Federal Reserve Board, which granted SoFi a bank charter in January 2022. The Federal Reserve had determined that certain crypto-related activities conducted by SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, were not permissible for a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and Regulation Y.</p>
<p>Despite the determination, SoFi was allowed to continue its crypto operations for a limited period, with the possibility of extensions. However, the company has decided to cease its cryptocurrency services amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. cryptocurrency industry. This move follows regulatory guidance from the Federal Reserve, which introduced a &#8220;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/federal-reserve-establishes-program-monitor-crypto-activities-us-banks.htm">novel activities supervision program</a>&#8221; in August, imposing stringent requirements on how banks engage with emerging financial technologies, including cryptocurrencies. SoFi is seen as the first major financial institution to exit the cryptocurrency space due to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s heightened scrutiny.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve&#8217;s program, aimed at supervising relationships between banks and cryptocurrencies, appears to have influenced SoFi&#8217;s decision to discontinue its crypto services. The regulatory guidance became particularly relevant after SoFi received approval as a bank holding company earlier in the year. The company expressed concerns about the growing strictness of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s requirements for crypto-related activities over time, leading to the belief that full approval for their crypto business was becoming increasingly unlikely.</p>
<p>Additionally, SoFi highlighted concerns about the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) proposed adjustments to Regulation ATS and the Exchange Act Rule, which could impact the classification of crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>SoFi&#8217;s move to exit the crypto business echoes a broader trend, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metropolitan-commercial-bank-closes-crypto-vertical-emphasises-it-no-liabilities.htm">Metropolitan Commercial Bank</a> also deciding to exit its crypto business in January. Regulatory developments and changes in the environment regarding banks&#8217; involvement in crypto-asset-related businesses are cited as key reasons for these exits.</p>

<p>The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, John Lee, has responded to the recent investigation into the unlicensed virtual-asset trading platform Hounax.</p>
<p>On November 27, Chief Executive John Lee addressed the recent virtual platform supervision fraud and emphasized the importance of government supervision to protect investors and crack down on unlicensed platforms. According to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/11YmJQZV8ZzntJ72aJfPfw">local news blog</a>, he expressed a willingness to cooperate with regulators and grant additional powers if needed to crack down on unlicensed crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If it is necessary to provide power to regulatory agencies, the government will actively cooperate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>His comments highlight the need for government supervision to protect investors and combat unlicensed platforms in the crypto space, as the recent Hounax fraud case follows a similar incident involving JPEX, a crypto exchange. The JPEX exchange scandal received over 2,000 complaints and resulted in approximately $180 million in losses. A total of 66 individuals have been arrested in connection with the JPEX scandal. In response to these events, local regulators in Hong Kong are strengthening crypto regulations to prevent future industry catastrophes.</p>
<p>However, regulators have said the country&#8217;s one-year grace period for crypto exchanges won&#8217;t change. Lee urged investors to use <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-reveal-list-of-crypto-license-applicants-wake-of-jpex-scandal.htm">licensed trading platforms</a> for virtual asset transactions to safeguard their interests.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission specifically reminds investors that all entities on the list of applicants for virtual asset trading platforms have not been licensed by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and may not comply with the requirements of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Hounax Ponzi Scheme Hits Hong Kong Investors, Further Highlighting Challenges in Crypto Regulation</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On November 25, another unlicensed exchange, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-police-receive-145-complaints-of-hounax-crypto-scam-totaling-18-9m.htm">Hounax</a>, reportedly engaged in a Ponzi scheme, defrauding victims in Hong Kong of 148 million HKD ($18.9 million). The scammers pretended to be investment experts, luring users with promises of significant returns.</p>
<p>However, when users attempted to withdraw their funds, they discovered it was not possible.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Securities and Futures Commission listed Hounax as a suspicious crypto trading platform after it was found to have lied about its ties with a financial institution and a venture capital firm.</p>
<p>Before being added to the blacklist by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the cryptocurrency platform HOUNAX was actively recruiting customers in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>It claimed that it was co-founded by the original Coinbase technical team and had obtained a Canadian MSB license. It also threatened to obtain investment from well-known venture capital companies such as Sequoia Capital and IDG Capital.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-authorities-investigate-15-4-million-scam-on-hounax-report.htm">the police</a> have received 88 reports from 131 individuals, with alleged losses totaling $15.4 million. The age range of the victims was from 19 to 78, with the largest reported loss of $1.54 million belonging to a 69-year-old retired woman.</p>
<h2><b>Hong Kong Authorities Under Scrutiny as Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges Continue to Defraud Investors</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In response to the Hounax fraud case, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) released lists, including licensed virtual asset trading platforms, applicants, closed platforms, and those deemed licensed. The SFC emphasized the need for complete and compliant applications, including external evaluation reports, from platforms planning to apply for a license.</p>
<p>The website listed included nine suspicious virtual currency investment platforms. They are HOUNAX, JPEX, Hong Kong Digital Research Institute, BitCuped, FUBT, futubit/futu-pro, EFSPD, OSL trading, and arrano.network. However, the SFC has stated that it currently lacks the power to close unlicensed crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>However, some critics argue that authorities should take more decisive actions, such as blocking the platform from contacting the public, to prevent further harm to investors. Lawmaker Doreen Kong <a href="https://gbcode.rthk.hk/TuniS/news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1729571-20231127.htm?spTabChangeable=0">criticized</a> the reliance on an alert list and called for more proactive steps to protect the public from fraudulent platforms. She emphasized the importance of addressing the limitations in the regulatory framework to prevent further harm to investors.</p>
<p>Leung Fengyi, Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, also emphasized the importance of supervision in light of a virtual currency platform fraud case. Despite challenges, Leung stated that Hong Kong&#8217;s commitment to developing the Web3 ecosystem remains <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpex-scandal-wont-deter-hong-kongs-web3-market-development-says-treasury-secretary.htm">unchanged</a>.</p>

<p>Interactive Brokers, an automated global electronic broker, is expanding cryptocurrency trading to retail investors in Hong Kong. The broker is now the first SFC-licensed securities broker to be approved to allow retail clients to trade cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://osl.com/press-release/osl-interactive-brokers-retail-digital-asset-trading-hong-kong/">announcement</a> made on November 28, Interactive Brokers will be opening crypto trading for retail clients in Hong Kong in collaboration with OSL, a cryptocurrency exchange. This development allows Interactive Brokers&#8217; retail investors in Hong Kong to have immediate access to digital asset trading through a single unified platform powered by OSL.</p>
<p>Hong Kong clients of Interactive Brokers can now hold Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) in their accounts alongside traditional assets like stocks, derivatives, commodities, forex, and others. Each trade is subject to a commission ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% of the transaction value.</p>
<p>The clients receive the benefits of centralized cash management as they can now trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with stocks, options, futures, currencies, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), event contracts, cryptocurrency futures, and futures options, all from a single account and interface.</p>
<p>As the exclusive digital asset trading platform for Interactive Brokers, OSL aims to broaden investor access to digital finance, emphasizing its commitment to setting global standards for performance, security, and compliance.</p>
<p>Hugh Madden, CEO of OSL and BC Group, stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This expansion with Interactive Brokers is a testament to our enduring commitment to lead the regulated evolution of the digital asset market. Offering our cutting-edge services to retail investors aligns seamlessly with our strategy, bringing the benefits of such an asset class to a broader audience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The partnership signifies OSL&#8217;s dedication to collaborating with prominent names in traditional finance, demonstrating its role as a key player in bridging the gap between the traditional financial sector and the dynamic realm of digital assets. By providing extensive expertise, OSL aims to facilitate a smoother transition for financial institutions entering the digital asset space.</p>
<h2><b>Interactive Brokers Expands Global Presence with Hong Kong License and Equity Investment</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Interactive Brokers has continuously been undertaking measures to enhance its global presence. The company has recently received a license for retail virtual asset trading in Hong Kong, allowing the firm to broker trades in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The firm enables investors around the world to trade stocks through mobile applications.</p>
<p>In addition, Interactive Brokers was among the pioneers in introducing Overnight Trading for U.S. stocks and ETFs, allowing trading almost 24 hours a day, five days a week. The introduction of the Interactive Brokers app, IBKR Lite, has given investors the opportunity to trade commission-free, and this move is anticipated to enhance the company&#8217;s market share.</p>
<h2><b>Hong Kong Cryptocurrency Market Faces Challenges Amidst Scandals and Regulatory Updates</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite Hong Kong being among the first jurisdictions to issue licenses for cryptocurrency exchanges, its momentum has been hampered by a series of exchange scandals.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong crypto scene was faced with a scandal in September when unlicensed crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpex-scandal-undermines-trust-crypto-among-hong-kongers-survey-reveals.htm">JPEX allegedly scammed investors</a> out of nearly $165 million.</p>
<p>On November 25, Hounax, another unlicensed crypto exchange in Hong Kong, reportedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-authorities-investigate-15-4-million-scam-on-hounax-report.htm">scammed 145 residents out of 148 million HKD</a> ($18.9 million) through an alleged Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>Despite the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in Hong Kong <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/intermediaries/supervision/doc?refNo=23EC44">revising</a> its cryptocurrency policies in October, citing &#8220;the latest market developments and inquiries from the industry,&#8221; the updated policies specify that certain digital currency offerings will be restricted to professional investors.</p>
<p>Additionally, crypto intermediaries are required to evaluate whether clients possess sufficient knowledge of investing in virtual assets before facilitating transactions.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-retail-investors-more-interested-crypto-than-ever-before-reveals-sfc-survey.htm">survey</a> conducted by the Investor and Financial Education Council of Hong Kong revealed that only 47% of retail investors in the region are aware of the local regulations concerning virtual assets.</p>

<p>Standard Chartered, a British multinational bank, will initiate exchange services for China&#8217;s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan, as it is set to participate in its trials.</p>
<p>On November 27, Standard Chartered <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5DGXMboiUOlJlHJUBqTaqw">announced</a> that it is set to participate in trials of China&#8217;s digital yuan, the central bank&#8217;s digital currency (e-CNY CBDC). This makes Standard Chartered one of the first foreign banks to engage in trials of China&#8217;s digital currency.</p>
<p>The bank&#8217;s China division is collaborating with City Bank Clearing Services to provide customers with access to the digital yuan&#8217;s interconnection platform, allowing for recharge and redemption. This will enable its clients to purchase, exchange, and redeem e-CNY within their bank accounts. The bank will reportedly focus on areas such as cross-border merchant payments, trade financing, and supply chain financing as part of the pilot testing program, which is currently active in 26 cities and provinces across China.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s e-CNY (electronic Chinese Yuan) has gained notable adoption, and global banks are increasingly expressing interest in exploring the use cases and potential integration of digital currency. Standard Chartered&#8217;s move follows the broader trend of major economies worldwide initiating digital currency programs.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Visa also <a href="https://www.visa.com.hk/zh_HK/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases/nr-hk-231101.html">announced</a> that it had completed the Hong Kong Monetary Authority&#8217;s CBDC pilot program with leading financial institutions, HSBC and Hang Seng Bank. This pilot was part of the &#8220;Digital Hong Kong Dollar&#8221; program organized by the HKMA, which was initiated earlier this year in May and was the first use case globally to utilize tokenized deposits for interbank B2B self-transactions and cross-chain transactions.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered&#8217;s integration of the digital yuan reflects the commitment of global banks to embrace digital currencies. Virtually every major economy worldwide has initiated a digital currency program. Nevertheless, China&#8217;s e-CNY has stood out with notable adoption over the past year.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s digital yuan is considered the most advanced CBDC among those researched or developed by major economies. By the end of June this year, it had reached a <a href="https://finance.caixin.com/2023-10-12/102116216.html">transaction volume</a> of 1.8 trillion yuan ($250 billion), and the number of wallets had reached 120 million.</p>
<p>While few banks have enabled their customers to transact with China&#8217;s CBDC, Standard Chartered&#8217;s move signals an increasing acceptance of digital yuan services by global financial institutions.</p>
<p>The bank expressed optimism about the development prospects of the digital renminbi, emphasizing its deep roots in the Chinese market over the past 165 years.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s e-CNY currently stands as one of the most widely used digital currencies globally. Its implementation extends to various public services, including transportation in specific districts.</p>
<h2><b>Standard Chartered Continues Collaboration with China on Digital Yuan</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Standard Chartered&#8217;s participation in offering exchange services for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinese-banks-stepping-up-blockchain-cross-border-trade-fina-8016.htm">China&#8217;s digital yuan</a> builds upon its previous involvement in exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p>Last year, the bank took part in the &#8220;Multilateral Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge&#8221; proof-of-concept test project in Hong Kong, focusing on cross-border payment settlement services for both retail and enterprise clients.</p>
<p>Additionally, in May 2023, Standard Chartered, in collaboration with PricewaterhouseCoopers China, released a report titled &#8220;Central Bank Digital Currency to Create a Future Banking Ecosystem.&#8221; The report delved into the potential applications of CBDCs in retail, trade, and supply chain finance.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s central bank has been actively promoting the adoption of its digital yuan, also known as e-CNY. A recent <a href="http://zj.people.com.cn/n2/2023/1125/c186327-40654676.html">white paper</a> published by the People&#8217;s Bank of China titled &#8220;A cross-border e-commerce business-to-business digital renminbi application solution&#8221; emphasized the integration of e-CNY CBDC by commercial payment processors for consumer transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, a Chinese state-owned bank has announced plans to connect the digital yuan to the &#8220;world&#8217;s biggest small commodities market,&#8221; a move that could potentially boost the adoption of China&#8217;s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-aiming-for-international-digital-yuan-expansion-e-cny-going-global.htm">Standard Chartered&#8217;s engagement</a> in these initiatives showcases the ongoing collaboration between global financial institutions and China&#8217;s efforts to advance its digital currency ecosystem.</p>

<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is encountering difficulties in serving a lawsuit against Richard Schueler, also known as Richard Heart, the founder of Pulsechain, PulseX, and the controversial project Hex.</p>
<p>On July 31st, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-founder-of-hex-pulsechain-richard-heart-sued-by-sec-for-securities-fraud.htm">SEC filed a lawsuit against Heart</a> for allegedly selling unregistered securities and defrauding investors. The SEC&#8217;s lawsuit accused Heart, Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX of violating federal securities laws through the unregistered offer and sale of securities. The complaint focused on the fundraising activities that raised over $1 billion for these projects. The SEC alleged that Heart defrauded investors through misappropriation of funds, diverting at least $12 million for personal purchases, including a McLaren sports car, a Ferrari, and five watches, instead of developing the protocols.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also targeted Heart&#8217;s control of the project, his statements regarding potential increases in value, and the staking feature designed to encourage token holders to lock up their tokens in exchange for more tokens. The SEC pointed to Heart&#8217;s previous comments claiming that Hex was built to be &#8220;the highest appreciating asset&#8221; and notes the significant decline in the price of Hex and the perceived worthlessness of tokens for the other two projects.</p>
<p>The SEC noted that the price of Hex experienced a staggering 98.4% decline from its all-time high, and the tokens for the other two projects, PulseChain and PulseX, are described as &#8220;practically worthless.&#8221; These assertions form the basis of the SEC&#8217;s claims of securities law violations, emphasizing the purported misleading statements by Heart regarding the potential appreciation of Hex.</p>
<h2>SEC Faces Challenges Serving Lawsuit to Hex and PulseChain Founder Richard Heart</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The U.S. SEC is encountering difficulties serving a lawsuit against Richard Schueler, also known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex and PulseChain. The SEC alleges that Schueler sold unregistered securities, and despite requesting the Ministry of Justice of Finland to serve the lawsuit against Schueler in Helsinki, there has been no confirmation of successful service.</p>
<p>A teleconference initially planned for November 28 has been rescheduled to January 30, 2024, by Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo, who oversees the case in the Eastern District of New York. The SEC&#8217;s complaint argues for jurisdiction in the Eastern District based on the assertion that many of the crypto asset transactions related to the case occurred on Uniswap, a decentralized crypto asset trading platform with developers headquartered in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.501047/gov.uscourts.nyed.501047.10.0.pdf">filing</a> notes that the commission will update the court on the status of its service efforts under the Convention by December 15, 2023. If service has not been achieved by that time, the SEC plans to seek alternative service in accordance with Rule 4(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p>According to several industry experts, Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), pleading guilty to US anti-money laundering laws could pose challenges to the cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s ambitions in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On November 21, Changpeng Zhao <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">stepped down as CEO of Binance</a> and pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering laws, resulting in a $4.3 billion settlement to resolve a lengthy federal investigation. Binance, as a company, also pleaded guilty to similar charges, including the failure to report suspicious transactions with organizations labeled as terrorist groups and websites involved in child sexual abuse materials.</p>
<p>This settlement comes amid escalating regulatory challenges for Binance in the United States, including a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June that accused the company of commingling customer funds. The cryptocurrency exchange has been taking steps to address these challenges, including laying off over 1,000 workers, witnessing executive departures, exiting certain markets, and selling operations, for example, in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-to-halt-russian-ruble-deposits-as-part-of-exit-strategy-from-russia.htm">Russia</a>.</p>
<p>While several cryptocurrency firms are turning to Asian hubs, especially Hong Kong, for business opportunities amidst increased scrutiny in the US, Binance has not publicly expressed interest in establishing a presence in Hong Kong. Observers note the difficulties Binance might encounter in acquiring a license in Hong Kong, given its regulatory troubles elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Binance has set up a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-reportedly-behind-new-hong-kong-crypto-exchange-seeking-license.htm">separate crypto exchange in Hong Kong</a> named HKVAEX, signaling its intent to pursue a license in the city. However, the shared resources between Binance and HKVAEX might complicate the regulatory landscape for the latter, as the guilty pleas and settlements with US authorities could cast a shadow over the broader Binance ecosystem.</p>

HKVAEX, described as an &#8220;independent virtual asset exchange platform,&#8221; stated last month that it is preparing to apply for a license in Hong Kong. However, experts suggest that Binance&#8217;s legal troubles could complicate the regulatory approval process, especially given the robust requirements set by Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) for virtual asset trading platform applicants.</p>
<p>The SFC considers the compliance of substantial shareholders, ultimate owners, or other controllers with anti-money laundering laws and convictions related to money laundering or terrorist financing in Hong Kong or elsewhere. Binance would need to demonstrate to the regulators that it is not effectively controlled by individuals with serious criminal records.</p>
<p>As Binance undergoes a leadership change, with Richard Teng appointed as the new CEO after Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s resignation, regulatory scrutiny is expected to extend to the new leadership.</p>
<p>Even with the change in leadership, Binance would need to demonstrate to regulators, such as the SFC, that it is not effectively controlled by individuals with serious criminal records. The SFC has robust requirements for virtual asset trading platform applicants, and any significant ties to individuals with legal issues could impact the regulatory assessment of the license application.</p>
<p>The Director of Licensing and Head of the Fintech Unit at the SFC, Elizabeth Wong, mentioned in a podcast recording that it would depend on how Binance enters the market and its structure when asked about the possibility of Binance obtaining a license in Hong Kong. Wong also noted that Binance is not on <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3235679/hong-kongs-sfc-publish-names-cryptocurrency-platform-applicants-walking-back-reluctance-face-public?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article">the list of virtual asset trading platform operators</a> that have submitted license applications.</p>
<p>The outcome of Binance&#8217;s efforts to secure a license in Hong Kong remains uncertain, and the recent guilty plea may impact the regulatory landscape for both Binance and its affiliated entities seeking compliance in various jurisdictions.</p>

<p>According to Ambient Exchange founder Doug Colkitt, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">KyberSwap&#8217;s $46 million hack</a> was &#8220;the most complex and carefully engineered smart contract exploit&#8221; and confirmed that what happened was an infinite money glitch.</p>
<p>In a detailed thread on X dated November 23, Colkitt <a href="https://twitter.com/0xdoug/status/1727613541115429314">outlined</a> the intricacies of the attack, shedding light on the methods employed by the attacker.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Finished a preliminary deep dive into the Kyber exploit, and think I now have a pretty good understanding of what happened.</p>
<p>This is easily the most complex and carefully engineered smart contract exploit I&#39;ve ever seen&#8230;</p>
<p>&mdash; Doug Colkitt (@0xdoug) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xdoug/status/1727613541115429314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Colkitt explained that the attacker exploited a distinctive implementation of KyberSwap&#8217;s concentrated liquidity feature, manipulating the contract to believe it possessed more liquidity than it actually did. To explain the intricacies of the attack, and with the attacks following similar strategies employed by the attacker across other pools, Colkitt focused on the first attack, which targeted the ETH/wstETH pool.</p>
<p>The process began with a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x09a3a12d58b0bb80e33e3fb8e282728551dc430c65d1e520fe0009ec519d75e8/advanced">flash loan of 10,000 wstETH</a>, valued at $23 million at the time. Subsequently, 2,800 wstETH (equivalent to $6 million) was swapped into the pool to alter the price from 1.05 ETH to 0.0000152. Unlike typical flash loans, the goal here was not to manipulate an oracle but to move the pool price to an area on the concentrated liquidity curve with zero existing liquidity.</p>
<p>This precise manipulation of Kyber&#8217;s concentrated liquidity math created an opportunity for the attacker to exploit the system. The attacker generated 3.4 wstETH of liquidity in a specific price range and then inexplicably burned 0.56 wstETH of liquidity, possibly to align subsequent numerical calculations perfectly.</p>
<p>The exploit executed two swaps in this manipulated liquidity environment. In the first swap, the exploiter sold 1,056 wstETH for 0.0157 ETH, pushing the price down to 0.0000146. The second swap involved the exploiter buying 3,911 wstETH from the pool for 0.06 ETH, raising the price back up to 0.00001637.</p>
<p>According to Colkitt, the key revelation in the attack was the creation of an infinite money glitch. The second swap resulted in the exploiter receiving more money than paid in the first swap, even though the only liquidity present was the approximately 3 wstETH minted at the beginning of the exploit. This intricate manipulation allowed the attacker to drain the pool successfully.</p>
<h2>Doug Colkitt Unravels KyberSwap Attack, Reveals Exploitation of Concentrated Liquidity</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the unraveling of the complex KyberSwap attack, Doug Colkitt further raised questions about the unexpected additional funds generated during the attack and set out to investigate the anomalies. He discovered that the attacker, by carefully exploiting KyberSwap&#8217;s concentrated liquidity feature, tricked the platform into perceiving more liquidity than actually existed, resulting in overpayments for large swaps.</p>
<p>The key to this manipulation lies in a flaw related to KyberSwap&#8217;s handling of liquidity at tick boundaries. Colkitt highlighted two crucial clues that aided in understanding the exploit&#8217;s mechanics. Firstly, the resting state of the pool&#8217;s liquidity at the end of the second swap showed a non-zero value, even though the swap ended at a price outside the attacker&#8217;s liquidity range.</p>
<p>The second clue came from comparing the call trace stack for the first and second swaps. In KyberSwap, when tick boundaries are crossed, the `updateLiquidityAndCrossTick` function is invoked to adjust the curve&#8217;s liquidity value based on the LP range positions at that tick.</p>
<p>The exploit successfully manipulated this process during the first swap. Colkitt explained that the `updateLiquidityAndCrossTick` function was never called during the first swap, even though it should have been. This allowed the attacker to double-count liquidity when moving back in range, creating the illusion of more liquidity than there actually was.</p>
<p>The technical intricacies involved exploiting KyberSwap&#8217;s calculation of swaps as a series of steps, with each step determining whether the swap reaches a tick boundary or exhausts. The attacker skillfully manipulated these calculations, preventing the invocation of `updateLiquidityAndCrossTick` during the first swap while ensuring it occurred during the second swap, thereby tricking the pool into double-counting the liquidity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ First thing to note is this exploit is specific to Kyber&#39;s implementation of concentrated liquidity</p>
<p>There&#39;s no reason to believe that other reputable concentrated liquidity dexes, like Ambient or Uniswap, are at risk from this exploit. (Though Kyber forks obviously are)</p>
<p>&mdash; Doug Colkitt (@0xdoug) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xdoug/status/1727613542252024187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, Colkitt emphasized that the exploit discussed in the analysis is specific to KyberSwap&#8217;s implementation of concentrated liquidity. There is currently no indication or reason to believe that other reputable decentralized exchanges implementing concentrated liquidity, such as Ambient or Uniswap, are at risk from this particular exploit. He also noted that KyberSwap forks may be vulnerable, but platforms with distinct implementations are not necessarily exposed to the same risks.</p>

<p>Crypto exchange HTX, formerly known as Huobi Global, said it &#8220;has now properly handled this attack,&#8221; and it will resume deposits and withdrawals within 24 hours after suffering a $13.6 million exploit on Nov. 22.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.htx.com/support/zh-cn/detail/24955033595175">Nov. 23 announcement</a> on its official website, Huobi HTX responded to a recent security incident, pledging to fully compensate for the losses incurred and ensuring the complete safety of user funds. According to the statement, the funds lost in the attack constitute only a minimal portion of the platform&#8217;s total funds, and the normal operation of Huobi HTX remains unaffected, reassuring users.</p>
<p>In the statement, HTX said:</p>
<p class="ql-long-67570003"><span>&#8220;Huobi HTX has now properly handled this attack. Huobi HTX once again promises to fully compensate for the losses caused by this attack and 100% guarantee the safety of user funds. The amount of funds lost by Huobi HTX this time accounts for a very small amount of the total funds of the platform. The normal operation of Huobi HTX will not be affected by this. Users should rest assured.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Huobi HTX aims to mitigate the impact of the security breach by promising comprehensive compensation for any losses experienced by users. The platform emphasizes that the incident&#8217;s financial ramifications are limited, and users can have confidence in the ongoing operational integrity of Huobi HTX.</p>
<p>The announcement also conveys the platform&#8217;s commitment to swiftly restoring normal services, with Huobi HTX expected to resume deposit and withdrawal services within 24 hours. However, users are encouraged to stay informed by regularly checking the platform&#8217;s official announcements for updates on the specific timing of the service resumption.</p>
<h2>Security Woes Continue for HTX as $13.6 Million Loss Adds to a Series of Exploits</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a series of concerning developments, HTX encountered a significant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">security incident on Nov. 22</a>, suffering an estimated loss of $13.6 million. The incident unfolded as part of an $86.6 million exploit against the HECO Chain Bridge involving HTX, Tron, and BitTorrent, all of which are linked to or de facto controlled by Chinese blockchain entrepreneur Justin Sun.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Blockchain security firm Cyvers released findings on the exploit, revealing that the losses originated from three compromised hot wallets. In this sophisticated attack, users and exchange assets were converted into Ether (ETH), and the stolen funds were subsequently disbursed to various Ethereum addresses. The impact of the exploit extended to a variety of coins and tokens, with notable losses, including 1,240 ETH, 7.3 million USDT, 1.78 million USD Coin (USDC), and 62,200 LIN (LINK).</p>
<p>In response to the incident, HTX emphasized its commitment to user asset protection and information security, vowing to take all necessary measures to prevent future occurrences. However, this incident follows a troubling pattern, as HTX and Sun-linked entities have experienced four hacks in the past two months.</p>
<h2>Security Woes Persist as HTX and Sun-Linked Entities Endure Fourth Hack in Two Months</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a distressing trend, HTX and entities linked to Justin Sun have fallen victim to yet another security breach, marking the fourth hack in the past two months. The most substantial incident was the $100 million exploit targeting <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/poloniex-to-resume-deposits-and-withdrawal-services-after-100-million-exploit-heres-more.htm">Poloniex</a> on Nov. 10, which stemmed from an apparent compromise of private keys, as indicated by blockchain security firm CertiK.</p>
<p>In response to the suspicious outflows, the <a href="https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/19080588734743">Poloniex team</a> promptly disabled the affected wallet. Justin Sun, taking to X (formerly Twitter), assured users that the platform maintains a healthy financial position. He pledged full reimbursement to affected users and expressed intentions to collaborate with other exchanges to recover the lost funds.</p>
<p>This incident follows a concerning pattern of security breaches involving Sun-linked entities. In September, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/htx-hacker-makes-off-with-8-million.htm">HTX suffered an $8 million loss</a> due to another hot wallet exploit. Despite the reassurances at the time, claiming that &#8220;all user assets are SAFU and the platform is operating completely normally,&#8221; the recurrence of security incidents raises questions about the overall safety and resilience of these platforms.</p>

<p>In a significant move towards solidifying its position as Europe&#8217;s emerging crypto-capital, Lugano city in the southern Switzerland Ticino region has seamlessly integrated the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol into its crypto-friendly payment app, MyLugano.</p>
<p>Polygon, as revealed in a <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/city-of-lugano-upgrades-payment-app-to-add-polygon-pos">November 22 blog post</a>, announced the successful integration of its PoS protocol into the MyLugano payment app, enabling Lugano residents to conduct transactions seamlessly within the broader Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the updated version of MyLugano introduces a cutting-edge multichain digital wallet for personal custody. The press release indicates that several tokens have already been integrated into this app section, with plans in place to incorporate more in the future.</p>
<p>Lugano has emerged as a global leader in crypto adoption with MyLugano, developed in collaboration with crypto company <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/swiss-city-of-lugano-and-tethers-plan-summer-school-achieves-second-year-milestone.htm">Tether</a>, serving a substantial user base of 30,000 individuals, nearly half of the city&#8217;s population. This user-friendly app facilitates payments in digital currencies for local small- to medium-sized traders.</p>
<p>The MyLugano app, recognized with the prestigious IEEE Smart City Award, has enabled over 30,000 users to access a loyalty circuit through LVGA, the city&#8217;s proprietary stablecoin. The integration of Polygon PoS not only enhances MyLugano&#8217;s functionality as a local payment tool but also opens doors for users to explore a myriad of decentralized apps within the Polygon network.</p>
<h2>MyLugano Expands Digital Presence with NFT Collection and Green Art Initiative</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a bid to further enhance its digital footprint, MyLugano, the crypto-friendly payment app of Lugano City, is set to launch a new Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection dedicated to the artistic work of Yuri Catania, as per the latest statement.</p>
<p>According to Polygon’s blog, the NFT collection, titled LVGA/XY Flowers, is a tribute to the collaboration between MyLugano and Lugano Living Lab. This innovative collection is inspired by a 40-meter-long, 8-meter-high art installation on the wall of the Palazzo dei Congressi. Noteworthy is the fact that several hundred people actively participated in the creation of this colossal work.</p>
<p>Employing the paste-up technique, the physical art piece is intentionally designed to fade away gradually. Over 2,000 paper flowers, intricately attached to the wall, are destined to transform into real flowers as they are transplanted into a newly designated green area. However, the essence of this unique art project is not confined to the physical realm alone.</p>
<p>In a forward-thinking move, MyLugano is ensuring that the LVGA/XY Flowers project lives on in the digital space as well. The art piece will be tokenized as NFTs on the Polygon network, each signed by the artist, Yuri Catania. These NFTs will be distributed to all those who actively contributed to the creation of the original physical installation, providing a lasting digital representation of their involvement in this unique artistic endeavor.</p>
<h2>Lugano&#8217;s Ambitious Blockchain Transformation Gains Momentum with Polygon and Tether Support</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/swiss-city-of-lugano-makes-bitcoin-tether-de-facto-legal-tender.htm">city of Lugano</a> has ambitious plans to transform into Europe&#8217;s blockchain capital. As part of this vision, citizens and companies will be able to utilize Bitcoin, Tether, and LVGA to pay for various services, including annual taxes, parking tickets, public services, and student tuition fees. This move paves the way for cryptocurrencies to become legal tender in the city, with Polygon PoS facilitating key transactions.</p>
<p>Lugano has already made significant strides in the past few years to actualize its blockchain-centric vision. The city launched a digital wallet and a loyalty program based on LVGA points, offering residents a seamless and rewarding experience when using digital assets. Furthermore, Lugano introduced 3Achain, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible city blockchain utilizing a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism intricately linked to the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>As the network provider for tens of thousands of decentralized apps (DApps) with $5 billion in secured assets, Polygon has been a key partner for Lugano since at least 2022. Initially serving as an infrastructure partner for the city&#8217;s stablecoin, LVGA, Polygon continues to provide its cutting-edge rails solution to support Lugano&#8217;s crypto endeavors.</p>

<p>Decentralized crypto exchange Pancakeswap has launched a new voting system called &#8220;Gauges&#8221; and &#8220;veCAKE,&#8221; a new vote-escrowed system that allows users to vote on governance proposals and determine CAKE emissions allocations.</p>
<p>According to a Nov. 22 <a href="https://blog.pancakeswap.finance/articles/introducing-gauges-voting-and-ve-cake-your-ownership-of-cake-emissions">blog post</a>, PancakeSwap, the third-largest decentralized exchange by total value locked (TVL), has unveiled two new features, Gauges Voting and veCAKE, designed to enhance governance influence for CAKE holders. These features aim to stimulate liquidity across pools and increase rewards for CAKE staker.</p>
<p>PancakeSwap wrote in the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to introduce two transformative features: Gauges Voting and veCAKE, revolutionizing our governance system for CAKE Emissions. This strategic update is designed to empower CAKE holders with increased governance influence, boost liquidity across our pools, and supercharge rewards for CAKE stakers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>PancakeSwap&#8217;s governance token, CAKE, is distributed as rewards to liquidity providers and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization called CakeDAO, consisting of all CAKE holders. The platform currently boasts over $1.4 billion in TVL, making it a prominent player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p>Notably, PancakeSwap has phased out its &#8220;syrup pool&#8221; reward system, previously enabling CakeDAO members to stake CAKE for an additional share of the exchange&#8217;s fees. Instead, additional fees will now be distributed exclusively to users holding veCAKE. Participation in PancakeSwap&#8217;s DAO governance now relies on veCAKE, a new vote-escrowed system distinct from vCAKE. veCAKE tokens, obtained by staking CAKE, allow users to vote on governance proposals and determine CAKE emissions allocations through Gauges Voting.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The new Gauges Voting system allows veCAKE holders to influence the distribution of CAKE emissions in essential products like Farms on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum at launch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the newly introduced system, CAKE holders gain the ability to vote on additional rewards for specific pools every two weeks. However, to participate in voting, users must lock their CAKE tokens in a smart contract for a predefined period. The longer the lock-up period, the greater the voting power. It&#8217;s noteworthy that veCAKE is non-transferable, and users can only acquire it through CAKE staking. The maximum lock time for CAKE is set at four years, and the longer the lock, the higher the veCAKE rewards.</p>
<h2>PancakeSwap Introduces veCAKE for Enhanced Governance Power and Rewards</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
PancakeSwap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX), continues to push the boundaries of innovation with its latest feature, veCAKE. As veCAKE holders, users wield influence over the distribution of CAKE emissions within specific liquidity pools and projects. The process involves Gauges Voting, allowing for a more targeted and strategic approach to reward allocation.</p>
<p>The transition from vCAKE to veCAKE is a seamless experience through the platform&#8217;s interface, enabling users to transfer staked CAKE to the new contract effortlessly. The move to veCAKE comes with a myriad of benefits for CAKE stakers, including enhanced governance power, deeper liquidity, and enticing vote incentives.</p>
<p>One of the exclusive advantages for veCAKE holders is the ability to direct CAKE emissions to pools where they have stakes. This exclusivity potentially leads to a higher Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and increased liquidity in those pools. The system ensures that only veCAKE holders can wield this directing power, creating a dynamic environment for liquidity providers and traders alike.</p>
<p>Moreover, veCAKE holders can opt for additional vote incentives from projects through external bribing markets, introducing an extra layer of rewards for engaging in CAKE staking. This flexibility, combined with the power to vote through external markets or PancakeSwap Gauges Voting, offers a strategic advantage for veCAKE holders.</p>
<p>In the decentralized exchange landscape, PancakeSwap&#8217;s introduction of Gauges Voting and veCAKE aligns with its commitment to innovation and user empowerment. Notably, PancakeSwap recently expanded its offerings with the launch of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-pancakeswap-expands-into-gaming-with-new-marketplace-earn-cake-for-playing-games.htm">gaming marketplace</a>, inviting developers to build, publish, and update games directly on the platform.</p>
<p>As of the latest update, CAKE is trading at $2.44, reflecting a notable 6.49% increase in the last 24 hours. The market cap is also on the rise, marking a 7.84% increase.</p>

<p>Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee overseeing the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange&#8217;s estate, has initiated communication with rehabilitation creditors, indicating the imminent start of repayments. This development follows the notorious 2014 hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC.</p>
<p>As of November 21, Kobayashi began sending emails to rehabilitation creditors outlining the commencement of repayments, as per reports circulating on various social media platforms.</p>
<p>Kobayashi said in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/1811y1z/new_email_repayments_are_finally_happening_mtgox/">email</a>, </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Rehabilitation Trustee plans to commence repayment to creditors shortly. The Rehabilitation Trustee is making efforts to commence repayments in cash within the 2023 calendar year. However, due to the large number of rehabilitation creditors who will receive repayment, the varying types of repayments, and the different preparation and processing times required to make the repayment, repayments will continue into 2024.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to snippets shared from the alleged email, the trustee plans to initiate the first round of repayments in cash during the year 2023. The email did not specify the exact timing of repayments for individual rehabilitation creditors but mentioned the intention to continue the process into 2024.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Trustee <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mt-gox-trustee-moves-closer-to-pay-out-asks-creditors-for-payment-details.htm">Nobuaki Kobayashi</a> said in the email,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The specific timing of repayment to individual rehabilitation creditors is undetermined, and therefore, it will not be possible to provide advance notice to each rehabilitation creditor regarding the specific timing of their repayment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mt. Gox, once a prominent Bitcoin exchange, faced a devastating cyberattack in 2014, leading to the loss of a significant amount of Bitcoin. Since then, the legal and rehabilitation processes have been protracted, leaving creditors eagerly anticipating the recovery of their funds.</p>
<h2>Mt. Gox Rehabilitation Trustee Receives $47 Million for Creditor Repayments</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, according to an <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20231122_announcement_en.pdf">official document</a> sent to creditors on November 22, the rehabilitation trustee received a redemption of 7 billion Japanese yen ($47 million) aimed at funding the repayment of claims. The remaining trust assets following this redemption were reported to be 8.8 billion yen, or approximately $59 million.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We hereby announce that on November 17, 2023 (JST), the Rehabilitation Trustee received the redemption of JPY 7,073,684,082 from the Trust Assets as the amount necessary to fund the repayment of the Claims. The amount of the Trust Assets after such redemption is JPY 8,812,899,304.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the document, Kobayashi informed creditors that this redemption signals the commencement of repayments. The trustee mentioned that due to the large number of rehabilitation creditors, varying types of repayments, and the different preparation and processing times required, repayments will extend into 2024.</p>
<p>This recent move follows a September announcement in which <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-mt-gox-trustee-extends-repayment-deadlines-october-2024.htm">Mt. Gox extended the deadline</a> for rehabilitation creditor repayments from October 31, 2023, to October 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and creditors have expressed cautious optimism, interpreting this development as a promising step towards the long-awaited restitution of funds. Many view it as a significant move forward in the complex legal and rehabilitation processes surrounding Mt. Gox.</p>
<p>While many in the Mt. Gox community are cautiously optimistic about the development, some observers note that the recent communication only mentioned cash payments, while Wu Blockchain had reported that &#8220;Mt. Gox will distribute 142,000 BTC, 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen, among others.&#8221; Many victims of the Mt. Gox hack are expecting the return of substantial amounts of Bitcoin. The trustee currently holds 135,890 BTC on known addresses, valued at nearly $5 billion.</p>
<p>Community discussions indicate a mixture of hope and skepticism, with some acknowledging the progress represented by cash payments while others express concerns about the protracted history of delays in repayments. </p>

<p>Crypto lender Celsius has amended its reorganization plan, opting for a singular focus on bitcoin mining instead of the initially proposed combination of mining and staking.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174911212380000000054.pdf">court filing</a> on Monday, Celsius signaled its departure from the earlier Plan that combined both staking and mining and planned to transition to a new company that focuses only on mining bitcoin.</p>
<p>This move follows feedback from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/celsius-path-to-recovery-hindered-by-sec-challenges-report.htm">specific aspects of the initial reorganization plan</a>. The SEC&#8217;s request for additional information about the former crypto lender&#8217;s assets led to the revision of Celsius&#8217;s strategy.</p>
<p>Celsius said in the filing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Following confirmation, Celsius received feedback from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on certain aspects of the Plan, which has resulted in Celsius now intending to begin the process of applying to register the shares in a new publicly traded Bitcoin mining company that will be owned by Celsius customers (the &#8220;Mining NewCo&#8221;).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company now plans to initiate the registration process for shares in a new publicly traded Bitcoin mining company named &#8220;Mining NewCo,&#8221; to be owned by Celsius customers.</p>
<p>Initially, the court-approved reorganization plan designated implementation responsibilities to Fahrenheit Holdings, a consortium including Arrington Capital and crypto miner U.S. Bitcoin Corp. Approved in May 2023, the Plan outlined the creation of a new company registered in Delaware, temporarily referred to as NewCo. The original intention was for NewCo to engage in both mining and staking activities.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s feedback prompted Celsius to narrow its focus to bitcoin mining with Mining NewCo. The company anticipates commencing the registration process for shares in the new mining entity, representing a shift in its strategic direction.</p>
<h2>Bankrupt Crypto Lender Plans to Create Publicly Traded Bitcoin Mining Company After SEC Feedback</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Celsius intends to apply for the registration of shares in a new publicly traded bitcoin mining company, referred to as &#8220;Mining NewCo,&#8221; which will be owned by Celsius customers. The SEC&#8217;s feedback has prompted the retention of specific assets by Celsius&#8217;s estates for regulatory reasons, with plans to administer and monetize these assets for the benefit of creditors.</p>
<p>Negotiations are ongoing with parties involved in the future management of Mining NewCo, with further details expected to be disclosed as agreements are reached. Due to the reduced scope and scale of Mining NewCo compared to the initially proposed Fahrenheit NewCo, Celsius anticipates lower aggregate fees and economic incentives for operators. However, this adjustment is expected to result in a greater amount of liquid cryptocurrency available for direct distribution to customers.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, Celsius plans to file a motion with the bankruptcy court to seek approval for modifications to the reorganization plan, reflecting the shift to Mining NewCo. The company does not believe that these modifications will necessitate the solicitation of the Plan and still aims to commence distributions to creditors in January 2024.</p>
<h2>Celsius Emerges from Chapter 11 with Fahrenheit Investment</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Celsius, the crypto lending platform, is set to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy following its filing in July 2022. The SEC filed a lawsuit in July 2023 against Celsius and its former CEO, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/celsius-networks-alex-mashinsky-arrested-as-us-authorities-sue-bankrupt-crypto-lender.htm">Alex Mashinsky</a>, alleging false promises of a secure investment through the firm’s Earn Interest Program.</p>
<p>Despite the legal challenges, Celsius is working on a reorganization plan and is expected to exit Chapter 11 in early 2024, according to a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Founder of Arrington Capital, Michael Arrington, stated that Celsius&#8217; revival distinguishes itself from other crypto companies that collapsed in 2022 and were unable to reorganize.</p>
<p>As part of the reorganization, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fahrenheit-chose-as-winning-bid-celsius-bankruptcy.htm">Fahrenheit</a>, a blockchain infrastructure firm, will acquire a minority stake in the reorganized Celsius for $50 million. The new company&#8217;s stock is set to be publicly listed on Nasdaq, enabling Celsius customers to sell equity shares received as part of their bankruptcy recovery.</p>
