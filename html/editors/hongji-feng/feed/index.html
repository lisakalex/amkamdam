<p>BlackRock and Bitwise have recently updated their filings for spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-breaches-40000-level-for-the-first-time-in-18-months.htm">Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These frequent amendments may signal pivotal progress.</p>
<p>In its most recent updated submission, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">BlackRock</a>, the asset management giant, filed an amended S-1 filing with the SEC for its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF. This move reflects BlackRock&#8217;s ongoing commitment to launching a Bitcoin ETF, a monumental product that has seen heightened interest from investors and the broader financial community.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitwise-has-no-connection-with-now-defunct-bitwise-industries.htm">Bitwise</a>, another major player in the digital asset management space, has also filed an amended application for its Bitcoin ETF just before BlackRock did. This update aligns with Bitwise&#8217;s strategic efforts to introduce a bitcoin ETF to the market, catering to the growing demand among investors for listed crypto investment options.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Filings: “They&#8217;re Just Pouring In”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“They&#8217;re just pouring in,” said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1731804911350804573">James Seyffart</a>. “What does this mean? Without having read them &#8212; it just means that the wheel is still turning.”</p>
<p>Leading financial establishments like BlackRock and Grayscale have been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">meeting with the SEC</a> regarding their Bitcoin ETF filings. On Nov.28, the SEC officials met with BlackRock and the Nasdaq, as indicated by a memorandum. According to the memo’s note, BlackRock revised its In-Kind model design to address to the SEC’s concerns and “unresolved” questions regarding the model.</p>
<p>“Both the SEC and these issuers are working hard to iron things out,” said Seyffart. “These filings are likely the result of many conversations and a lot of man hours on/between both sides.”</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Hit $42,000</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin is currently trading at around $41,870, marking a 13% up from a week ago, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>. Bitcoin price broke the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-breaks-through-42000-up-6-6-in-24-hours.htm">$42,000 benchmark</a> on Dec. 4 and was up 6.6% within 24 hours. The surge represented a recovery to levels last achieved before the Terra crash back in May 2022. Bitcoin reached an all-time high price of $67,566.83 in Nov 2021, based on the data of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp">Statista</a>.</p>

<p>A critical Supreme Court case and its ruling could redefine the taxation of digital assets. Intersecting with the vexed IRS broker rule announced earlier, this case may potentially reshape crypto tax reporting and compliance on a fundamental level.</p>
<p>The case in question, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22-800.html">Moore v. U.S.</a>, revolves around a dispute concerning the tax treatment of certain investments. Charles and Kathleen Moore, the plaintiffs, are challenging a tax imposed on their investment in an India-based company. They argue that they had not realized income from this investment when the law was enacted, meaning they had not cashed in their profits or brought these profits back to the U.S. to make them subject to taxation under the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-16/">16th Amendment</a>. Ratified in 1913, the 16th Amendment grants Congress the power to levy income taxes without apportioning them among the states based on population.</p>
<h2>Defining &#8216;Income&#8217; in the Digital Age</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The argument focuses on the definition of “income” and “realized income”, questioning whether unrealized gains should be subject to tax. While this case primarily concerns overseas investments, its outcome could spark a broader debate about the taxation of various investment types, potentially influencing the tax code’s treatment of emerging asset classes, including digital assets like cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear the case on Dec. 5, and the outcome of Moore v. U.S. could carry significant consequences for cryptocurrency investors. If the Moores lose, it could enable the government to tax digital asset investments like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-soars-3-5-fed-cuts-stir-usd-zodia-joins-ripples-network.htm">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/get-ahead-of-the-ethereum-price-explosion-with-the-ethetf-token-before-blackrock-ethereum-etf-launches-price-pumps-400-in-early-action.htm">Ethereum</a>, or altcoins based on increased values, regardless of whether these gains have been cashed in or not. Conversely, a win for the Moores might establish that gains from such investments are not taxable until they are “realized” in a more traditional sense, such as being converted to cash.</p>
<p>The interpretation of “realization” in cryptocurrency, however, remains a contentious point. For example, some view the use of Bitcoin to purchase other altcoins as a realization of gains, essentially converting one investment form into another. This debate exemplifies the complexities and evolving landscape of tax regulations in the digital asset domain, highlighting the pressing need for clear, comprehensive guidelines.</p>
<h2>A Reddit User&#8217;s Crypto Tax Surprise</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Reddit user “Frosty_Huskers07” presents a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/189e3u6/owe_irs_over_50k_from_2021_looking_for_advice/">live example</a> of the complexities and challenges faced by cryptocurrency investors under the current tax laws. An early investor in Bitcoin and Ethereum, they faced unexpected tax implications during the 2021 crypto boom. “I was inexperienced and did not understand the concept every time I did this it created a taxable event,” they explained, referring to their trades from Bitcoin and Ethereum into various altcoins, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-solana-meme-coins.htm">Solana</a> (SOL), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-chainlink-going-to-zero-link-price-struggles-as-new-mining-protocol-bitcoin-minetrix-secures-4-6-million.htm">Chainlink</a> (LINK), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/litecoin-price-prediction-as-ltc-gains-2-16-in-24-hours-can-this-uptrend-continue.htm">Litecoin</a> (LTC).</p>
<figure id="attachment_138787" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138787" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138787" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701679191-reddit-irs.jpg" alt="Reddit" width="1200" height="686" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701679191-reddit-irs.jpg 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701679191-reddit-irs-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701679191-reddit-irs-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701679191-reddit-irs-768x439.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138787" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DALL·E</figcaption></figure>
<p>Believing that tax liabilities only arose when converting to USD, the user now finds themselves owing the IRS over $50k for 2021. Their portfolio, which had soared to around $330k, plummeted in value during the market crash, stabilizing at around $80k, diversified across several digital currencies. It remains unclear whether “Frosty_Huskers07” received this tax assessment directly from the IRS, derived it through their own calculations, or consulted with tax experts for this estimation.</p>
<h2>IRS&#8217;s Broker Rules and Crypto Oversight Future</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The IRS&#8217;s newly proposed digital asset broker reporting regulations, introduced in August 2023, have sparked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/irs-holds-hearing-on-digital-asset-reporting-regulations-following-pushback.htm">widespread debate</a> within the cryptocurrency sector. These regulations, which came under scrutiny during a public hearing following a deluge of nearly 125,000 comments, propose to expand the definition of &#8220;broker&#8221; for tax reporting purposes in a decentralized environment.</p>
<p>Coinbase, in a strongly worded <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-raises-concerns-over-proposed-irs-tax-regulations-crypto.htm">comment letter</a>, raised alarms about potential &#8220;unprecedented, unchecked, and unlimited tracking into the daily lives of American citizens.&#8221; This stance reflects a broader industry concern that the IRS&#8217;s approach, while aiming for transparency and fairness in treating cryptocurrencies like traditional assets, could lead to overcomplex and invasive regulations. As the implications of the Moore v. U.S. case collide with the IRS&#8217;s new broker regulations, the landscape of cryptocurrency reporting and taxation faces a potential overhaul.</p>

<p>Reddit has officially <a href="https://nova.arbiscan.io/tx/0x48fece81ba5ee6feef5b4d4caf8b832e6ba0cae7ea007fc3106d4aa82c2764db#eventlog">renounced the contract</a> of its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-30-iota-radix-theta-network.htm">cryptocurrency</a> Moons, setting a milestone completing the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm#:~:text=MDEX%20is%20not%20shy%20to,%241%20billion%20in%20market%20cap.">decentralization</a> of the token.</p>
<p>The Reddit administrators <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/187tg7a/moons_update_reddit_has_officially_renounced_the/">published a post</a> in the “r/CryptoCurrency” community, confirming that the renouncement of the Moons contract has been finalized. This action not only caps the supply but also ensures that no further modifications can be made to the contract, thereby establishing Moons as a fully decentralized entity within the crypto community.</p>
<p>With Reddit’s remaining 98,000 MOON tokens <a href="https://nova.arbiscan.io/tx/0x48fece81ba5ee6feef5b4d4caf8b832e6ba0cae7ea007fc3106d4aa82c2764db">burnt</a>, the total supply has been lowered from around 125,969,899 to 83,205,951, according to Reddit’s estimation. Moons now are effectively deflationary.</p>
<h2>Reddit Announced to Renounce Contract in October</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In October, Reddit administrators <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/17un84c/update_regarding_moons_contract_community_tanks/?share_id=vKdg9CkrZJJeXT8w03avX&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">announced</a> their intention to renounce the contract, a process which has now been finalized. “The contract will forever remain unchanged, rendering Moons completely decentralized,” highlighted the post from the “r/CryptoCurrency” community. This move ensures that no further alterations can be made to the contract, solidifying its status as a fully decentralized digital asset.</p>
<p>With the renouncement now complete, Reddit has set a new precedent in the community-driven governance of blockchain projects. The post outlined, “No new Moons can be created, and Moons can continue to be listed and traded by exchanges and wallets as before.” This maintains the token&#8217;s accessibility and liquidity in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>The forum’s sector remains the biggest crypto community, and advertisers still need to buy MOON for their space. Many users were celebrating the renouncement, cheering, “Over 40 million moons being burned and nobody owning the contract ever again is the best thing that could have happened.”</p>
<p>This decisive action by Reddit underscores a significant shift towards community empowerment in the digital currency space, reflecting a growing trend of decentralization and user-driven governance in blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the mod team will “continue to work on bringing back and improving features such as memberships, governance and tipping” and explore “restarting distribution, though exactly how that will work remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently held meetings with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-evaporating-and-traders-back-new-bitcoin-etf-token-with-more-than-2m-as-sellout-looms-and-sec-approval-bets-mount.htm">Grayscale</a> and BlackRock to discuss their filed applications regarding spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs).</p>
<h2>SEC Meets with Grayscale to Discuss its Bitcoin ETF Filing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-305159-785022.pdf">memorandum</a> published by the SEC indicates that officials from the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets met with Grayscale Investments on Nov. 29 to consider the proposed conversion of Grayscale&#8217;s listed Bitcoin Trust into a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-hits-38000-amid-microstrategy-buy-sec-etf-buzz.htm">Bitcoin</a> ETF.</p>
<p>According to the memo, the discussion “concerned NYSE Arca, Inc.’s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.”</p>
<p>The participants of the meeting included David Shillman, the Associate Director in the SEC&#8217;s Division of Trading and Markets, who oversees the U.S. equity, options and fixed income markets, and Michael Sonnenshein, the CEO at Grayscale Investments. Grayscale’s external representatives from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP also attended the meeting.</p>
<h2>BlackRock Revises its In-Kind Model Design</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Nov.28, the SEC officials also met with BlackRock and the Nasdaq, as indicated by <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nasdaq-2023-016/srnasdaq2023016-303319-781202.pdf">another memo</a>. While the SEC’s side was led by Eric Juzenas, the Associate Director in the SEC&#8217;s Division of Trading and Markets, BlackRock’s Digital Assets Head Robert Mitchnick and Nasdaq’s Principal Associate General Counsel Jonathan Cayne participated in the discussion, specifically about <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">revising BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF model</a>.</p>
<p>According to the published memo’s note, BlackRock revised its In-Kind model design to address to the SEC’s concerns and “unresolved” questions regarding the model.</p>
<p>BlackRock’s proposed “In-Kind” redemption model involves market makers adjusting ETF shares supply and directly redeeming them for Bitcoin. This aims to closely link the share price with Bitcoin’s value.</p>
<p>However, the SEC has concerns with this model, mainly because it requires U.S. broker-dealers to directly handle Bitcoin, posing potential risks to their investments. In response, the SEC suggested a “Cash” model, which, though safer for broker-dealers, could make the fund’s operation more complex and involve more steps for BlackRock.</p>
<p>“This [revised] model appears to address the Staff’s concern with In-kind, addressing the critical dimension on which the In-kind model would otherwise be not preferred to the Cash model,” said the note.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is currently trading at $38,223, almost 1% up from yesterday and 11% up from 30 days ago, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>. The SEC’s pending approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs could potentially drive the Bitcoin price to skyrocket.</p>

<p>Forbes has released its latest <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2024/finance">“30 Under 30” list in Finance</a>, featuring a significant number of leaders from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-29-stacks-thorchain-celestia.htm">cryptocurrency</a> and blockchain industries, highlighting their growing influence in the financial sector.</p>
<p>The list includes innovators like the co-founders of Injective Labs, the co-founder of Fractal, the co-founders of Toku, and leaders from financial establishments including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/apple-ends-partnership-with-goldman-sachs-as-tech-giant-expands-into-lending.htm">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-highlights-resurgence-in-defi-and-nft-sectors.htm">JPMorgan</a>. This representation of young crypto pioneers on Forbes&#8217; list demonstrates the vital role digital assets and blockchain technology are playing in shaping modern financial services and solutions.</p>
<h2>Young Visionaries Transforming Crypto &amp; Blockchain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Eric Chen and Albert Chon, cofounders of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/eric-chen-ceo-of-injective-labs-building-finance-specific-blockchains-current-state-of-defi-ep-263.htm">Injective Labs</a>, lead a blockchain platform that&#8217;s made significant strides in the decentralized finance space. Their Injective blockchain has processed over 300 million transactions, totaling nearly $13 billion, at an average cost below 1 cent. Supported by investors like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-in-philippines-binance-is-operating-without-a-license-heres-the-latest.htm">Binance</a> Labs and Mark Cuban, they raised $57 million. This January, they launched a $150 million fund, backed by crypto giants like Pantera Capital, to further propel decentralized finance.</p>
<p>Kenneth O’Friel and Dominika Stobiecka co-founded Toku, specializing in helping crypto startups manage token-based employee compensation and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-supreme-court-case-and-irs-broker-rule-together-could-redefine-crypto-taxation.htm">tax regulations</a> across over 100 countries. Their clients include notable firms like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/derivatives-trading-protocol-dydx-chain-commences-rewards-distribution-after-greenlight-from-community.htm">dYdX</a> and Protocol Labs. In March, Toku raised $20 million in a round led by Blockchain Capital.</p>
<p>Sei Labs, co-founded by Jeff Feng and Jayendra Jog, focuses on enhancing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">crypto</a> trading on its specialized blockchain. Developed in response to the 2021 GameStop frenzy, Sei offers faster transaction times than Ethereum and has quickly grown since its August launch, backed by $35 million from investors. The platform already boasts an estimated 7 million active wallets.</p>
<h2>The 2023 List</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Forbes&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2023/finance">2023 list</a> also featured numerous crypto and blockchain leaders.</p>
<p>Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap Labs, transformed an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum</a>-based concept into one of the most popular crypto applications. After working as an analyst at Siemens, Adams contributed to the development of Uniswap exchange in 2018, pioneering the use of automated market makers for decentralized cryptocurrency trading. Uniswap has amassed millions of users and earlier this year achieved a significant milestone, surpassing $1 trillion in lifetime trading volume.</p>
<p>Starting as an equity research analyst at Credit Suisse, Ria Bhutoria later joined the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-market-dominance-hits-18-month-low.htm">stablecoin</a> issuer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-signs-mou-with-sbi-holdings-to-expand-usdc-in-japan.htm">Circle</a> to develop their research platform. By 26, she rose to the position of Director of Research at Fidelity Digital Assets, managing $4.5 trillion in assets. Committed to diversity in the crypto space, Bhutoria invests in female and nonbinary founders through the decentralized collective Komorebi, alongside her work at Castle Island.</p>
<h2>&#8217;30 Under 30&#8242; On Chain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This year’s “30 Under 30” list was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/forbes-latest-under-30-list-data-will-be-listed-on-ethereum.htm">live</a> on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Ethereum blockchain</a>, marking a new milestone as the publication marched onto web3.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forbes is at the forefront of marrying traditional media with cutting-edge technology. By launching the Under 30 list on the Ethereum blockchain, we&#8217;re not just recognizing the influential young leaders; we&#8217;re also demonstrating the vast, untapped potential of blockchain technology in the realm of data storage and security,&#8221; said Vadim Supitskiy, Forbes’ Chief Digital and Information Officer.</p>

<p>Celo’s developer has proposed a <a href="https://forum.celo.org/t/framework-for-selecting-an-l2-stack/6992">comprehensive plan</a> to guide the selection of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Layer-2</a> technology provider, with a plan to finalize their decision in January 2024.</p>
<p>cLabs, the primary developer behind Celo, published a “framework for selecting an L2 stack” on their discussion forum, seeking feedback from the users. The framework outlines the criteria for selecting a Layer-2 technology provider, a key part of Celo&#8217;s plan to integrate with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-breaches-2000-resistance-time-to-buy.htm">Ethereum</a>&#8216;s network. cLabs&#8217; initiative aims for community involvement in the decision, with the final choice expected by mid-January.</p>
<h2>Key Features of Celo&#8217;s Proposed Layer-2 Framework</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The framework detailed some of its core criteria and values, including Ethereum compatibility and increased security for technical considerations, simple migration with minimal downtime for migration feasibility, and independence within Ethereum for governance alignment.</p>
<p>“We would love your input, suggestions and feedback, to make this framework more reflective of all the priorities and concerns of Celo stakeholders,” said the post. “Right now, ‘we’ reflects cLabs’ views, but we hope as this doc evolves we can incorporate the general consensus of the whole community.”</p>
<p>cLabs also aim to adjust to the users’ suggestions if the team sees fit. “We’re running a little behind our own stated timeline for figuring this out, but hope we can get general consensus on the framework by mid Dec. Once we feel we’ve reached general consensus on this framework, cLabs will begin work on evaluating each L2 stack against this framework.”</p>
<p>On 13 Dec. 4pm (GMT), cLabs will hold an L2 discussion call regarding the framework. The announced framework was an extension from cLabs’ <a href="https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109">original proposal</a> published in July. The L1 to L2 upgrade was initially brought out to “foster a financially inclusive community and build openly in the spirit of Web3, bringing real-world use cases to the Ethereum ecosystem.” In August, Celo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/google-cloud-partners-with-celo-network-as-validator-facilitating-ethereum-layer-2-migration.htm">announced</a> that they are partnering with Google Cloud for the Ethereum L2 migration.</p>

<p>Zipmex has put forward a new proposal to repay creditors, initially offering 3.35 cents for each dollar of their claims as part of its restructuring efforts, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/ailing-crypto-firm-zipmex-makes-another-attempt-at-restructuring?leadSource=uverify%20wall#xj4y7vzkg">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>This initial payout is part of a broader plan to address the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-28-celestia-uniswap-toncoin.htm">crypto</a> exchange&#8217;s $97.1 million debt and is contingent on the future recovery of assets, according to “people familiar with the matter.” The proposal could potentially increase the repayment to as much as 29.35 cents per dollar, depending on the success of these recovery efforts.</p>
<p>The sources also addressed that major creditors have expressed reservations about Zipmex&#8217;s latest plan. They are advocating for an independent review to closely examine the recent changes in the company&#8217;s assets and liabilities as reported in the October 4 court document. This scrutiny is seen as crucial for ensuring transparency and fairness in the restructuring process.</p>
<p>Zipmex&#8217;s Group Chief Executive Officer Marcus Lim commented on the situation, stating, &#8220;I am unable to comment on the on-going scheme of arrangement as this is confidential.&#8221; He acknowledged the presence of inaccuracies in the information obtained from the sources but chose not to elaborate on them.</p>
<h2>Zipmex Faces Regulatory Scrutiny Amid Restructuring</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The proposal comes in the wake of a challenging period for the crypto exchange, which has been grappling with the fallout from last year&#8217;s rout in crypto prices. Zipmex, operating across Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Singapore, is currently undergoing restructuring supervised by a court in Singapore.</p>
<p>A prior attempt to sell Zipmex to V Ventures, a subsidiary of Thoresen Thai Agencies, did not materialize. Additionally, last week, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-and-gulf-energy-to-launch-crypto-exchange-in-thailand.htm">Thailand</a>&#8216;s securities regulator instructed Zipmex to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zipmex-thailand-suspends-crypto-trading-citing-compliance-with-the-countrys-sec-rules.htm">suspend its operations</a> in the country due to insufficient net capital.</p>
<p>“Dear customers, Zipmex Limited would like to ensure the proper and compliant conduct of the company’s business operations in accordance with the criteria set by Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),” the exchange said following the suspension. “Therefore, it is necessary for the company to temporarily suspend digital asset trading and deposit of all types.”</p>

<p>The KyberSwap hacker has indicated plans to propose a deal, with a statement expected on November 30.</p>
<p>Following last week&#8217;s $47 million <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/4-common-cybersecurity-risks-to-your-crypto-wallet.htm">exploit</a> of KyberSwap, the hacker has <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5c27d8e9248608f36b028a945f3d6ff31244ab45eb89e1d1a631f608a36454a1">left a message</a> on the network reinstating the inclination to negotiate, with plans to release a detailed statement on a potential agreement tomorrow.</p>
<p>“I said I was willing to negotiate. In return, I have received (mostly) threats, deadlines, and general unfriendliness from the executive team. That&#8217;s ok, I don&#8217;t mind,” said the hacker in an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum</a> transaction. “I have prepared a statement concerning our (potential) treaty. I plan to release it on Nov. 30 at Noon UTC, sharp.”</p>
<p>The hacker also left an on-chain message when they first <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">exploited</a> the decentralized <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-28-celestia-uniswap-toncoin.htm">crypto</a> exchange on Nov. 23, stating, “Negotiations will start in a few hours when I am fully rested. Thank you.”</p>
<h2>KyberSwap Recovered $4.67 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Recently the company engaged with the operators of frontrunning bots that withdrew approximately $5.7 million from KyberSwap&#8217;s pools on Polygon and Avalanche amid the security breach. Following discussions, these operators consented to return 90% of the extracted user funds, resulting in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-retrieves-4-7-million-after-security-attack.htm">a recovery of $4.67 million</a> by KyberSwap.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The KyberSwap team has been in contact with the owners of the frontrun bots that extracted about $5.7M* worth of funds from KyberSwap pools on Polygon and Avalanche during the exploit.<br />We have negotiated with the owners of the frontrun bots to return 90% of the users’ funds taken…</p>
<p>&mdash; Kyber Network (@KyberNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1728800315955437743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Following this recovery of users’ funds from the frontrun bots, we will continue to support law enforcement and cybersecurity on track down and recovery of users’ funds from the perpetrator of the exploit attack,” KyberSwap said.</p>
<p>KyberSwap suggested its users to withdraw funds after the hack last week, while stating that its aggregator was “not impacted” and “operating fully as normal.”</p>
<p>According to Ambient Exchange founder Doug Colkitt, the hacker <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-exploited-in-46-million-attack-due-to-infinite-money-glitch.htm">targeted a specific aspect</a> of KyberSwap&#8217;s concentrated liquidity feature, tricking the contract into recognizing more liquidity than was actually present. This exploit essentially allowed for what amounted to an &#8220;infinite money glitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>HTX (formerly known as Huobi Global) <a href="https://www.htx.com.nr/support/en-us/detail/94955073779429">announced</a> that deposit services for major chains will be gradually resumed on their platform, beginning today, complemented by an airdrop event as a gesture of gratitude to its users.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, HTX has completed the necessary preparations for resuming deposit services. After thorough security checks, the exchange will start allowing deposits for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-now-september-1-maker-toncoin-tron.htm">TRON</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-many-bitcoins-are-there.htm">BTC</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">ETH</a> chains.</p>
<p>“Currently, a thorough review is underway through collaboration between the team and a third-party security company. To ensure the security of user assets, HTX is set to gradually resume deposits for TRON, BTC, and ETH chains on the platform, starting from November 24, 2023, at 08:00 (UTC),” said HTX.</p>
<p>Besides the mentioned chains, other services will resume, too. “Following this, the resumption of withdrawal services will be conducted in an orderly manner. Please stay tuned for our further announcements,” said HTX.</p>
<p>The resumption should begin at the time of writing.</p>
<h2>HTX Announces Airdrop to Thank Users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In addition, HTX is celebrating the restoration of its services with an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pyth-airdrop-ethereum-solana-and-aptos-set-to-benefit-from-new-platform-launch-heres-how-to-check-eligibility.htm">airdrop</a> event for all users, as a gesture of appreciation for their support. The event details will be shared in early December, with rewards drawn from a premium asset soon to be listed on the platform.</p>
<p>“To express our gratitude for your ongoing support and trust, we have specially planned an extraordinary token airdrop event to reward all our users,” wrote the announcement. “We will unveil the specific details of this event in early December. Please keep an eye on our updates.”</p>
<p>On Nov. 22, HTX was <a href="https://www.htx.com.nr/support/en-us/detail/24955033595175">attacked by hackers</a> and suffered a $13.6 million exploit. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/htx-huobi-global-to-resume-deposits-and-withdrawals-after-13-6-million-exploit.htm">exchange promised</a> to “fully compensate for the losses caused by this attack and 100% guarantee the safety of user funds” in a statement following the attack.</p>

<p>JPMorgan analysts have reported that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-updates-bitcoin-etf-prospectus-after-discussing-with-sec.htm">Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</a> (GBTC) could experience outflows of at least $2.7 billion if it is converted into a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-rises-above-37000-amid-market-optimism-is-the-bull-market-back.htm">Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-etfs.htm">exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/264543/jpmorgan-gbtc-outflows-estimates-etf-conversion">report from JPMorgan</a> suggests that traders have been buying GBTC shares at a discount, likely aiming to profit by cashing out the holdings if the trust converts to an ETF and the share price rises to match its Bitcoin assets.</p>
<h2>JPMorgan&#8217;s Report on GBTC&#8217;s Potential Outflow</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After the calculation of the GBTC inflows since 2023, the analysts came to the conclusion that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to ETF conversion could result in outflows upwards of $2.7 billion as investors sell off shares.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan analysts team, led by Global Market Strategy Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, explained their methodology, stating, “To proxy the buying flow into [the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust] since the beginning of the year, we cumulate the daily signed dollar volume, i.e., the daily volume in thousands of shares times the price times the sign of the price change, positive if the price had increased over that day and negative if the price had decreased.”</p>
<p>&#8220;This methodology produces an estimate of around $2.5 billion for the net cumulative flow into [the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust] since the beginning of the year. This number increases to close to $2.7 billion if one also adds the covering of the short interest since the beginning of the year,&#8221; said the analysts.</p>
<p>In addition, the analysts’ estimated $2.7 billion is the bare minimum outflow, and it could be “significantly more” unless GBTC’s current fee of 200 basis points is lowered to around 50 basis points.</p>
<p>“Once the SEC approves spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., we envisage a more intense competition with the average fee for bitcoin ETFs converging towards that of Gold ETFs, which currently stands at around 50 basis points,&#8221; said the JPMorgan analysts.</p>

<p>GBTC is currently trading at $30.45, up by 27% from a month ago, according to Yahoo Finance.</p>
<h2>Incoming Competition of Management Fees</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To give some context, Cathie Wood’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-and-21shares-amend-bitcoin-spot-etf-application.htm">ARK Investment Management</a> and 21Shares recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/cathie-wood-s-ark-21shares-unveil-0-8-fee-on-pending-spot-bitcoin-etf">filed an update</a> for their spot Bitcoin ETF application (ARKB), adjusting the management fee from 70 basis points to 80.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brief-approval-window-opens-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-90-chance-of-approval-by-january.htm">James Seyffart</a> initially assumed that the fee of ARKB would be lower and “closer to 50 basis points,” which would be around the average of 54 basis points (0.54%) across US-listed ETFs.</p>
<p>“Also the fact that Ark and 21Shares have updated their filing from a 70 basis point fee to 80 basis points might mean that running these products is going to cost even more than some sponsors and issuers thought it would,” said Seyffart.</p>

<p>On-chain data indicates that the hack on KyberSwap resulted in significant losses of $48 million across several blockchain networks, including 20 million from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-arbitrum-network-tokens.htm">Arbitrum</a>, $15 million from Optimism and $7 million from Ethereum.</p>
<p>The stolen funds were primarily deposited in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, Wrapped Ethereum (wETH), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-launches-bridging-standard-for-stablecoin-deployment-on-new-networks.htm">USD Coin (USDC)</a>. The analysis of the incident indicates a direct attack on the exchange&#8217;s liquidity pools instead of a vulnerability in the platform&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>Kyber Network has sent out notifications to advise users to withdraw their funds. “We regret to inform you that KyberSwap Elastic has experienced a security incident,” said Kyber Network. “As a precautionary measure, we strongly advise all users to promptly withdraw their funds. Our team is diligently investigating the situation, and we commit to keeping you informed with regular updates.”</p>

<p>The company stated that KyberSwap’s aggregator is “not impacted” and is “operating fully as normal.” In the meantime, Kyber Network reminds the investors of potential scams and not to click any phishing links or respond to direct messages.</p>
<p>In addition to being a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">decentralized exchange (DEX)</a>, KyberSwap is also an automated market maker (AMM) with liquidity protocols and concentrated liquidity. Instead of using traditional order books like a conventional exchange, an AMM like KyberSwap uses liquidity pools that allow assets to be traded automatically.</p>
<h2>Rampant Hacker Activities</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The hackers have recently been rampantly exploiting exchanges for profits. On Nov. 22, the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">HTX and blockchain protocol Heco Chain</a> were hacked for $97 million worth of digital tokens. Earlier on Nov. 19, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/taiwanese-crypto-trading-firm-suspends-operations-following-26-million-hack.htm">Kronos Research</a> was also breached with $26 million stolen.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-crypto-regulation-plan-draws-criticism-from-former-fca-head.htm">UK</a> government has announced a new legislative proposal for a Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), aiming to create a supportive testing environment for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-22-dydx-thorchain-fetch-ai.htm">crypto</a> technologies and services.</p>
<p>In the recently released <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/655e107697196d000d985d6b/E02982473_Autumn_Statement_Nov_23_Accessible_v3.pdf">Autumn Statement</a>, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt detailed 110 measures to bolster economic growth, including the introduction of the Digital Securities Sandbox as a key step towards enhancing the country&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-asset-funds-record-176-million-inflows-as-market-rebounds-heres-more.htm">digital asset</a> legislation.</p>
<p>According to the Statement, the UK government will proceed with the legislation to implement the DSS, which will “facilitate the adoption of digital assets across financial markets.” The government will also “lay an SI to implement the DSS, delivering on the Edinburgh Reform announcement to implement a Financial Market Infrastructure Sandbox in 2023.”</p>
<p>The SI, also known as the statutory instrument, will be introduced by the government before the Parliament can officially and permanently implement the DSS. The DSS initiative will presumably begin in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>UK&#8217;s Attempt to Focus on Innovation and Regulation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In July, the UK government <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/launch-permanent-digital-sandbox">published a consultation</a> on its proposal for implementing a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/digital-sandbox">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>, an initiative run by the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority. It was the first Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) Sandbox set up under the powers given to the Government in the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) 2023.</p>
<p>Following its launch, the DSS has received feedback from the industry on the consultation. The government has also published a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/655c893ed03a8d001207fda1/M8298_Draft_response_to_DSS_consultation_final.pdf">response to the consultation</a>, summarizing the feedback received. According to the response, “feedback praised the emphasis on facilitating innovation, without compromising on regulatory outcomes.”</p>
<p>However, the DSS still have some gaps to fill. “On unbacked cryptoassets, the government will maintain the policy of exclusion for the DSS,” said the Response, “given there is currently no established regime for cryptoassets that could be amended in the Sandbox.”</p>
<p>It is also possible to include non-GBP digital assets in the DSS. But for now, “the early activity in the DSS is likely to be focused on GBP-only assets.” The Bank of England will eventually decide if to include non-GBP assets.</p>

<p>In South Korea, the cryptocurrency community is calling for stronger reporting standards and a more rigorous regulatory framework as multiple virtual assets encounter delistings and circulation discrepancies, <a href="https://www.digitaltoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=495199">according to Digital Today</a>.</p>
<p>The push for enhanced oversight follows a series of delistings and reported inconsistencies in the circulation volumes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/phantom-wallet-guide-how-to-set-up-get-started.htm">altcoins</a> such as Galaxia (GXA) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/enjin-coin/">Enjin (ENJ)</a>, sparking controversy and undermining investor confidence in the market.</p>
<h2>ENJ and GXA Circulation Issues Trigger Regulatory Call in South Korea</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Enjin Coin was delisted from the Upbit fiat market in September due to a significant increase in tokens released. The Enjin Coin mainnet integrated the original <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">Ethereum</a>-based tokens with a new Polkadot-based chain, resulting in the issuance of up to 2 billion new tokens.</p>
<p>Last September, 350 million ENJ tokens were released and distributed, leading to a substantial 35% of total existing tokens being released into the market within two months of the mainnet&#8217;s launch, potentially driving up the token&#8217;s inflation rate to about 75%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_134929" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134929" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-134929" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia.png" alt="Galaxia" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia.png 1600w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700648249-galaxia-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-134929" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Galaxia</figcaption></figure>
<p>Galaxia (GXA), another virtual asset, also fell into controversy when it was discovered that the actual number of tokens in circulation exceeded the amount initially announced by the foundation.</p>
<p>On October 17, a hack on the platform compounded the issue with 380 million GXA tokens stolen. Following the hack, Galaxia was found to have exceeded the announced distribution volume in the market. As of October 31, the distribution announced by the Galaxia Foundation was 2.5 billion units, but the actual distribution amount reached 3 billion units.</p>
<p>Galaxia Foundation responded to the incident, claiming, “The quantity known to have been exceeded, approximately 500 million units, is the quantity paid by the Galaxia Foundation to Galaxia Metaverse as operating agency fees, etc. in 2022. The reason the Foundation did not collect (the quantity) was unnecessary due to coin movement.”</p>
<p>“This was to eliminate any potential misunderstandings. We decided to deduct this amount as operating agency expenses in 2023,” said the Foundation.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency data service company Xangle demonstrated the importance of strengthened scrutiny, saying, “In order to prevent similar distribution volume incidents from recurring, it is necessary to introduce clear standards for calculating distribution volume and a proven disclosure system that can monitor them.”</p>
<h2>Bithumb CEO&#8217;s Trial Begins as Crypto Scrutiny Escalates</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trial-of-bithumb-operators-ceo-begins.htm">The trial of Lee Sang-jun</a>, CEO of Bithumb Holdings, began in Seoul on Nov. 21, adding to the urgency for greater scrutiny in South Korea&#8217;s cryptocurrency sphere. Lee faces charges for allegedly “soliciting the listings” of unnamed altcoins on the Bithumb exchange.</p>
<p>This case adds to the existing concerns over transparency and regulation in the industry, as exemplified by the recent delistings and circulation discrepancies of several altcoins, stressing the need for stricter oversight within the crypto community.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently held discussions with Grayscale about converting the Grayscale <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-minetrix-presale-enters-stage-9-last-chance-to-buy-before-price-hike.htm">Bitcoin</a> Trust (GBTC) into its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-301179-767742.pdf">A memorandum</a> published by the SEC indicates that officials from the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets met with Grayscale Investments on Nov. 20 to consider the listing matters for turning its Bitcoin Trust into a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-rocky-token-surges-270x-in-24-hours-investors-are-turning-their-attention-to-this-other-bitcoin-etf-project-how-does-it-work.htm">bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>
<p>According to the memo, the discussion “concerned NYSE Arca, Inc.’s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.”</p>
<p>The participants of the meeting included David Shillman, the Associate Director in the SEC&#8217;s Division of Trading and Markets, who oversees the U.S. equity, options and fixed income markets, and Michael Sonnenshein, the CEO at Grayscale Investments. Grayscale’s external representatives from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP also attended the meeting.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1727105945120194617">Another filing</a> revealed that Grayscale has agreed with the Bank of New York Mellon for it to act as the transfer agent for the trust’s shares.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Investments&#8217; Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In October, Grayscale filed an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-blackrock-file-updated-applications-for-bitcoin-spot-etfs-with-sec.htm">updated application</a> for its spot Bitcoin ETF. The updated application came after the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-crypto-asset-management-firm-wins-lawsuit-against-sec.htm">court ruling</a> favor Grayscale’s previous application. More specifically, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of Grayscale ordering the SEC to set aside its earlier rejection of Grayscale’s application and reopen the review process.</p>
<p>In the meantime, other major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Fidelity are also seeking opportunities to list their spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the SEC has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-to-decide-on-two-spot-bitcoin-etfs-by-nov-17.htm">constantly postponing</a> applications filed by different entities.</p>

<p>Amid leadership changes at OpenAI, Anthropic, backed by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-granted-post-trial-extension-in-new-signed-order.htm">FTX</a>, has turned down an offer to merge and take on a leading role, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-approached-anthropic-about-merger?irclickid=Vj0Rby3-CxyPUIKRAjXfYUPvUkFXRqRmtRJUXc0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&amp;utm_term=coindesk.com">The Information</a>.</p>
<p>The Information reports that after OpenAI’s board fired the former CEO Sam Altman, the company approached its rival company Anthropic and to the CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei to take over as its CEO and discussed the possibility of merging the two AI entities, as revealed by “person with direct knowledge.” Amodei turned down the offer. “It’s not clear whether the merger proposal led to any serious discussion,” said the report.</p>
<p>Later on, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-board-approached-anthropic-ceo-about-top-job-merger-sources-2023-11-21/">Reuters also confirmed</a> OpenAI’s proposal of the merger and the attempt to recruit Amodei, according to “two people briefed on the matter.”</p>
<p>Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees including Dario Amodei. Amodei worked as Vice President of Research at OpenAI until 2020, leading “the efforts to build GPT-2 and GPT-3.” He was also “one of two people who sets overall research direction at OpenAI and writes its annual research roadmap,” according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-amodei-3934934/">LinkedIn page</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-237.pdf">legal proceedings</a> against the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, claiming it has been operating an unregistered securities trading platform.</p>
<p>The SEC filed the lawsuit in North District of California against the parent firms of Kraken, Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading Ltd. According to the SEC’s complaint, Kraken has provided unregistered crypto trading and transaction services to the public and allegedly created risks for its investors.</p>
<h2>SEC Against Unregistered Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“Without registering with the SEC in any capacity, Kraken has simultaneously acted as a broker, dealer, exchange, and clearing agency with respect to these crypto asset securities.” The SEC wrote in the filing, “In doing so, Kraken has created risk for investors and taken in billions of dollars in fees and trading revenue from investors without adhering to or even recognizing the requirements of the U.S. securities laws that are designed to protect investors.”</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC also stated that the company posed “significant risks” by mixing the users’ and investors’ crypto assets with its own corporate assets. “For example, Kraken has at times held customer crypto assets valued at more than $33 billion, but it has commingled these crypto assets with its own,” said the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC proceeded with specific instances to specify Kraken’s alleged wrongdoing. “In fact, Kraken has at times paid operational expenses directly from bank accounts that hold customer cash,” said the SEC. The agency also believed that according to the independent auditor, issues “related to Kraken’s recordkeeping of customer custodial assets” have resulted in “material errors to Kraken’s financial statements for 2020 and 2021.”</p>
<p>The accused Kraken’s operation of acting as an unregistered broker, dealer, exchange, and clearing agency mirrors the SEC’s ongoing lawsuits filed earlier this year against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm">Binance</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-coinbase-sued-by-sec-just-day-after-binance-lawsuit-which-firm-next.htm">Coinbase</a>. The SEC also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-identifies-algorand-five-other-tokens-as-securities-bittrex-case-heres-latest.htm">sued the crypto exchange Bittrex</a> for offering unregistered securities in April. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-crypto-exchange-bittrex-receives-bankruptcy-nod-to-cease-its-operations.htm">Bittrex</a> received its bankruptcy approval in October to cease its operations in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Kraken Responds to the Accusation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Kraken has responded to the lawsuit filing with a <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/news/kraken-continues-to-fight-for-its-mission-and-crypto-innovation-in-the-united-states">blog post</a>, claiming that the SEC’s complaint “alleges no fraud, no market manipulation, no customer losses due to hacking or compromised security, and no breaches of fiduciary duty.”</p>
<p>“Instead, the complaint makes a technical argument: that Kraken’s business requires special securities licenses to operate because the digital assets we support are really ‘investment contracts,’” said the exchange.</p>
<p>Regarding the accusation of commingling its own funds with the clients’, the company said that it is a “allegation already made of other crypto trading platforms” and hyperlinked the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-102.pdf">SEC’s filing against Coinbase</a>.</p>
<p>“The SEC cannot and does not allege that any customer funds are missing, or any loss has occurred. Nor does it allege that any loss will occur,” said the blog post. “The complaint itself concedes that this so-called ‘commingling’ is no more than Kraken spending fees it has already earned.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We strongly disagree with the SEC claims, stand firm in our view that we do not list securities, and plan to vigorously defend our position.</p>
<p>As we have seen before, the SEC argues that <a href="https://twitter.com/krakenfx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@krakenfx</a>  should “come in and register” with the agency, when there is no clear path to…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Kraken CEO Dave Ripley also voiced his disagreement with the SEC’s accusation, demonstrating the support for the Congressional action to resolve the “lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S.”</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is set to initiate the second phase of its digital Hong Kong Dollar project next year, focusing on the exploration of innovative applications and reinforcing collaborations across the financial industry.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.hk01.com/tag/50745">Fintech Foresight Seminar</a> held by Hong Kong 01, HKMA Chief Fintech Officer <a href="https://www.hk01.com/%E8%B2%A1%E7%B6%93%E5%BF%AB%E8%A8%8A/962938/%E6%95%B8%E7%A2%BC%E6%B8%AF%E5%85%83-%E9%87%91%E7%AE%A1%E5%B1%80%E5%91%A8%E6%83%A0%E5%BC%B7-%E4%B8%8D%E6%9C%83%E9%96%89%E9%96%80%E9%80%A0%E8%BB%8A-%E5%86%80%E8%88%87%E6%A5%AD%E7%95%8C%E7%99%BC%E6%8E%98%E6%96%B0%E7%94%A8%E4%BE%8B">Nelson Chow stated</a> that Hong Kong’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cbdcs-not-yet-ready-for-mainstream-says-mastercard-expert.htm">central bank digital currency (CBDC)</a> has <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2023/20231030e3a1.pdf?utm_source=coinspaidmedia&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hong-kongs-e-hkd-pilot-starts-second-phase">completed its first phase</a> and will proceed to the next phase in 2024.</p>
<h2>Digital Hong Kong Dollar&#8217;s Second Phase</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Building on the groundwork laid in the e-HKD Pilot Program’s initial phase, the HKMA’s forthcoming step will delve into real-world applications of the digital Hong Kong Dollar, seeking to integrate it within the broader economic framework.</p>
<p>Like the United Kingdom or other developed countries and regions, Hong Kong is still in the phase of testing CBDC. Chow said, “Hong Kong is definitely not falling behind; it is among the leading group conducting research. The e-HKD Pilot Program is of research value to other central banks as well.”</p>
<p>This announced second phase will prioritize the assessment of the digital currency’s potential impact on everyday transactions, while also leveraging partnerships with banking institutions and fintech companies to expand its practical use and acceptance.</p>
<p>According to Chow, e-HKD can add significant value to the retail payment ecosystem, including programmability, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapores-central-bank-expands-asset-tokenization-initiatives-under-project-guardian.htm">tokenization</a>, and instant settlement, to facilitate faster, more cost-effective, and inclusive transactions, which is beneficial for new economic and financial activities, such as web3 transactions.</p>
<h2>HKMA&#8217;s Cautious Path to e-HKD</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chow added that the pilot program consists of predefined small-scale tests. Before a large-scale implementation can take place, further research is required to determine whether the associated benefits exist.</p>
<p>It was also reiterated by Chow that even the second phase is planned, there is currently no final decision on when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-uncertain-on-e-hkd-issuance-says-retail-cbdc-needs-more-study.htm">e-HKD</a> will be launched. The outcome of the test phases and the development needs of both local and international markets will be considered for the ultimate decision.</p>

<p>Worldcoin’s valuation has shown a robust recovery from a recent slump, with the price rallying as Sam Altman continues in his role as chairman of Tools for Humanity, the developer behind the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Worldcoin (WLD) has made a significant comeback, seeing its trading price reaching $2.42, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/worldcoin-org/">CoinMarketCap</a>. This represents a notable increase of 16.66% over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Sam Altman, the former CEO of ChatGPT’s developer OpenAI, was <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition">announced to depart</a> the company on Nov. 17. Following the initial announcement, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altmans-departure-from-openai-triggers-a-sharp-decline-in-worldcoins-value-whats-going-on.htm">WLD experienced a dip in price</a>, trading at as low as $1.83, marking a 45% from WLD’s all-time high of $3.30, which was reached when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-world-app-hits-1m-mau-six-months-after-launch.htm">Worldcoin</a> emerged from beta in July.</p>
<p>Altman was abruptly removed from his position at OpenAI due to his alleged lack of candid communication. “Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” said the company.</p>
<p>Altman co-founded Worldcoin with Max Novendstern and Alex Blania in 2019. According to <a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/">Tools for Humanity’s website</a>, Altman remains as Chairman.</p>
<h2>Sam Altman to Return to OpenAI?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There have been speculations of various sources suggesting a potential comeback of Altman. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo">The Verge</a>, a source close to Altman said that “the board had agreed in principle to resign and to allow Altman and Brockman to return.” Followed by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-optimistic-it-can-bring-back-sam-altman-greg-brockman">The Information’s report</a> of OpenAI Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon telling employees that “the company is ‘optimistic’ about Altman returning.”</p>
<p>As a result, Altman’s the secured position at Tools for Humanity and the rumors of him returning as OpenAI CEO stabilized the price of WLD.</p>
<p>However, its valuation yet has seen another fluctuation, as OpenAI co-founder and board director Ilya Sutskever <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/breaking-sam-altman-will-not-return-as-ceo-of-openai">told The Information</a> that “Sam Altman won’t return as CEO of OpenAI, despite efforts by the company’s executives to bring him back.”</p>
<p>In addition, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear will take over as interim CEO, according to Sutskever.</p>

<p>Following the latest news, WLD took another downturn, trading at $2.33 at the time of writing, down by 0.84% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Mastercard’s expert Ashok Venkateswaran has expressed skepticism about the current viability of widespread central bank digital currencies (CBDC), claiming that the broad adoption of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapores-monetary-authority-to-expand-wholesale-cbdc-pilots.htm">CBDC</a> could be “difficult,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/17/mastercard-says-wide-adoption-of-cbdcs-is-difficult.html">according to CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>Venkateswaran, Mastercard’s Blockchain and Digital Assets Lead for Asia-Pacific, discussed the complexities surrounding the implementation of CBDCs during the <a href="https://www.fintechfestival.sg/">Singapore FinTech Festival</a>. He pointed out that for CBDC to be successful, they must be as accessible and spendable as traditional cash.</p>
<p>“The difficult part is adoption. So if you have CBDCs in your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-cold-wallets.htm">wallet</a>, you should have the ability for you to spend it anywhere you want – very similar to cash today,” said Venkateswaran.</p>
<p>However, implementing CBDCs would require substantial infrastructure development, a process that would involve considerable time and investment.</p>
<p>“[Building infrastructure to facilitate that] takes a lot of time and effort on a part of the country to do that. But a lot of the central banks nowadays have gotten very innovative because they are working very closely with private companies like ours, to create that ecosystem,” said Venkateswaran.</p>
<h2>Global CBDC Reality: Progress and Challenges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although the International Monetary Fund Managing Director <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/11/15/sp-111423-the-digital-finance-voyage-a-case-for-public-sector-involvement">Kristalina Georgieva</a> stated that CBDCs are “a safe and low-cost alternative” to cash and can “replace cash which is costly to distribute in island economies,” the complete implementation rate is relatively low.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">Atlantic Council</a>, 130 countries representing 98 percent of global economy are exploring central bank digital currencies. Yet only 11 of them have fully launched a digital currency. And even if a CBDC were introduced, consumers would still be “so comfortable using today’s type of money” that “there isn’t enough justification to have a CBDC,” Venkateswaran claimed.</p>
<p>On Nov.7, <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2023/mastercard-demonstrates-how-existing-commercial-bank-rails-could-drive-adoption-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs-in-the-future/">Mastercard announced</a> that it has completed the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) e-HKD <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kNwwURAAl4">Pilot Program</a>, showcasing its capability to power or assist in launching digital currencies like e-HKD.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-6-neo-kucoin-aave.htm">Aave</a> has announced its rebranding to Avara and the acquisition of Los Feliz Engineering, a Los Angeles-based <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">web3</a> startup.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Los Feliz Engineering, the acquired startup, is recognized for its development of the self-custody Ethereum wallet Family and the developer library ConnectKit. This acquisition brings Family and ConnectKit under Avara, now the parent entity of Aave Labs, Sonar, and Family.</p>
<p><a href="https://family.co/blog/avara">Benji Taylor</a>, the founder of Family, will also join Avara as the Senior Vice President of Product and Design, along with the entire engineering team from Los Feliz Engineering.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m incredibly excited to collaborate with Avara and look forward to contributing our expertise to their already talented team,” said Taylor.</p>
<h2>Expansion of Avara&#8217;s Ecosystem</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With the rebranding to Avara and the acquisition of Los Feliz Engineering, the company is broadening its scope in the web3 sector. This step signifies Avara’s commitment to expanding its offerings and integrating new technologies into its web3 portfolio.</p>
<p>Avara founder <a href="https://avara.xyz/blog/introducing-avara-and-announcing-acquisition-of-family">Stani Kulechov said</a>, “We believe this transformation will foster new businesses and offer a fair playing field, creating a vibrant web3 ecosystem that benefits all participants &#8211; users, creatives, applications, networks, algorithms, protocols, and DAOs alike.”</p>
<p>“These are significant strides toward our ultimate mission: an open, decentralized internet that’s equitable, inspires participation and fosters innovation,” said Kulechov.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you&#8217;re a startup looking to build from the ground up in web3 or an existing business keen to add decentralized features,&#8221; said Kulechov, &#8220;Avara aims to serve as the go-to brand for state-of-the-art web3 features and services that can seamlessly integrate into any application.&#8221;</p>
<p>This move follows Avara’s previous acquisition of Sonar in December 2022. Sonar, a web3 social gaming app that supports <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-com-partners-with-psg-soccer-team-for-early-access-to-blvck-paris-fashion-collab-nfts.htm">NFT</a>-based avatars, was the first “social metaverse” powered by Avara’s Lens Protocol. Sonar co-founders Ben South Lee and Randolph Lee also joined Avara upon acquisition.</p>
