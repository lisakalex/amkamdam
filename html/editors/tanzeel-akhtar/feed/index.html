&#8220;Overall, we feel that the SEC is truly invested in finding a way to enable blockchain tech to flourish in the U.S.&#8221;</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5d5/eb04028c85.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5d5/eb04028c85.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5d5/eb04028c85.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5d5/eb04028c85.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5d5/eb04028c85.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5d5/eb04028c85.jpg 1024w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. Source: Twitter, @SEC_News</figcaption></figure><p><b>Blockstack</b> and <b>Props</b> are the two first representatives of the crypto industry that managed to get an approval for their token sales from the <b>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</b> (SEC). Both journeys were a lengthy, challenging and costly process that ended successfully this past July.</p><p>Talking to <i>Cryptonews.com</i>, both companies shed a bit more light on the whole process and what it means to be a pioneer in this nascent industry. Of course, they couldn&#8217;t disclose all the details, but what we&rsquo;ve got might still help those knocking at the SEC&rsquo;s door.</p><p>Same as Props, Blockstack, a developer of a decentralized computing network, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/a-new-kind-of-token-sale-puts-you-next-to-harvard-endowment-4215.htm">got its permission</a> to conduct a token sale under the SEC&rsquo;s regulation A+. This regulation is &ldquo;an exemption from registration for public offerings,&rdquo; allowing companies to raise up to USD 50 million in a 12-month period without a need to &ldquo;register or qualify their offerings with state securities regulators.&rdquo;</p><p>Muneeb Ali, Co-founder and CEO of Blockstack, said that they began talking with the SEC over a year ago, while the whole process cost them USD 1.8 million in legal, accounting and other fees.  </p><p>&ldquo;We had an initial conversation with the [SEC] staff in the summer of 2018, and filed the initial draft of our circular in September of 2018.  From then onward, the SEC would provide feedback mainly via comment letters to which we would reply and iterate on the offering circular,&rdquo; Ali told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><p>This dialogue with the SEC was extremely important, the CEO stressed. </p><p>&ldquo;We spoke frequently with the staff of the SEC regarding our offering and open questions. It was an iterative process in which we proposed how to address issues for which there were no established answers, and the staff would provide their feedback,&rdquo; he said. </p><h2 data-param="1" id="speak-early-and-often">&lsquo;Speak early and often&rsquo;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p> </p><p>What were the obstacles?</p><p>&ldquo;There was little precedent on which we could rely, and we had to spend considerable time analyzing both legal and accounting questions for which there were no quick or easy answers,&rdquo; according to Ali. </p><p>However, the SEC was performing similar analyses of their own, as they weren&rsquo;t going to rely only on what Blockstack was offering.</p><p>What is Blockstack&rsquo;s advice to other firms looking to gain regulatory approval?   </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Speak early and often with the staff of the SEC. There&rsquo;s inevitably an education on both the staff&rsquo;s side and the company&rsquo;s side. Due to the nature of a digital token, no two look exactly the same, and so there&rsquo;s a learning curve on the part of the SEC in understanding the nature of the token and the related project,&rdquo; the CEO said. </p></blockquote><p> </p><p>He also stressed that those who are looking to get an approval from the SEC need to think about the myriad questions that the Commission might have and prepare answers, so the market regulator would understand the nature of their project. </p><h2 data-param="1" id="writing-a-playbook">Writing a playbook</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Meanwhile, Props, an open-source project intended to tokenize the digital economy, started by <b>YouNow</b>, a live streaming app with 46 million users, had a similar experience. </p><p>The company deliberated for a very long time, wondering what would be the best path for bringing the Props Token to life in a compliant way, according to Yonatan Sela, Co-founder of Props.</p><p>&ldquo;On the one hand, the SEC began saying that nearly all tokens are securities, but on the other hand there was no clarity that another path is possible &#8211; we knew that no crypto token had been qualified under Reg A+ before, and many told us that this is a dead-end,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Yet, after consulting with several law firms and industry experts for months, the team decided to go down the Reg A+ route. </p><p>&ldquo;We prepared for quite some time together with our legal advisors and put together an Offering Circular that we submitted to the SEC. So in practice &#8211; we simply followed the SEC&rsquo;s protocol and gave the SEC a lot of information to work with to kick things off,&rdquo; said Sela. </p><p>According to him, it has been both rewarding and very challenging &#8211; founders basically had to write the playbook for how a utility token can fit into the Reg A+ framework. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;This was a first for everybody involved &#8211; including the SEC. Overall, we feel that the SEC is truly invested in finding a way to enable blockchain tech to flourish in the U.S. At the same time, they are committed to following the U.S.&rsquo;s rules and regulations, which were designed long before crypto tokens and networks came into existence,&rdquo; Sela told Cryptonews.com. </p></blockquote><p>Props recognized that the SEC was interested in working with the company to find reasonable solutions that will enable their token to fulfill its intended purpose.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but as an entrepreneur living and working in the U.S., ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations is a necessity. There are smart, knowledgeable and reasonable professionals working at the SEC. Talk to them, and try to find solutions to your specific case,&rdquo; added Sela, reminding other firms dealing with the SEC to &ldquo;stay optimistic.&rdquo;</p><p>The SEC did not respond to our request for comment.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It will take another 12-24 months for the cryptocurrency ecosystem to be ready for institutional money to enter the space, according to Charles Hoskinson, CEO of blockchain consultancy and research firm <b>IOHK</b> that is developing the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> platform.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5cd/18b6045102.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5cd/18b6045102.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5cd/18b6045102.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5cd/18b6045102.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5cd/18b6045102.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5cd/18b6045102.jpg 1368w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Charles Hoskinson. Source: a video screenshot, Bloomberg/Youtube</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;The really smart money is aware that the market is not yet stable and that it is just not at the level of maturity [yet] to support institutional surge,&rdquo; Hoskinson told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><p>He stressed that should institutional investors, such as <b>BlackRock</b>, an American global investment management corporation, allocate 0,5% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies it would bring billions of dollars into the crypto market.</p><p>BlackRock ended 2018 with USD 5.98 trillion in assets under management. At the time of writing, crypto market capitalization stands at USD 190 billion.</p><p>According to Hoskinson, despite regulatory challenges, traditional investors are becoming more comfortable with the crypto ecosystem, while custodial solutions are being figured out, which is necessary for institutional money to enter the space.</p><p>As reported in May, a survey of more than 400 institutional investors in the U.S. showed that four in ten respondents say they are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/another-sign-institutional-investors-preparing-for-crypto-3792.htm">open to future investments in digital assets</a> over the next five years. Moreover, 22% already have some exposure to these assets.</p><p>Previously, Hoskinson estimated that it could take 10 years to regain the highs we have witnessed in the crypto market in 2017.  However, he stressed that if he would be good at predicting market movements, he &ldquo;would be a trader instead of an engineer.&rdquo;</p><p>In either case, according to his observations, the crypto market tends to move in spurts. </p><p>&ldquo;It [crypto prices] kind of spikes up, dies down and stays flat for a long period of time and then there&rsquo;s another spike. Regardless of when you come in, there is always going to be spikes. So, the dawn of tokens and Ethereum pushed Bitcoin to USD 1,200, the dawn of initial coin offerings pushed Bitcoin to USD 20,000 and created a huge interest. The next spurt will come from institutional money and the dawn of security token offerings (STOs),&rdquo; Hoskinson said.</p><p>As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/exclusive-securitize-ceo-on-when-sto-explosion-will-happen-3262.htm">reported</a>, the STO market is estimated to grow this year, but at a steady rate &#8211; and the explosion might come some time until 2021, according to Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of security token platform <b>Securitize</b>. </p><h2 data-param="1" id="cardanos-move-towards-decentralization">Cardano&rsquo;s move towards decentralization</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As for the main project of IOHK, the Cardano platform recently completed an upgrade dubbed &lsquo;Shelley&rsquo; which is pushing the platform towards its goal of full decentralization. </p><p>&ldquo;With the Shelley release, we will move from a federated setting, where all the block producing nodes are run by IOHK, <b>the Cardano Foundation</b>, and <b>Emurgo</b> [a venture fund controlled by IOHK], to a decentralized system where blocks are produced by stake pools. This will be permissionless, in the sense that anyone is free to run a stake pool, and every holder of ADA [the native token of Cardano] can delegate their stake to a stake pool of their choosing,&rdquo; Philipp Kant PhD, director of formal methods at IOHK, told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><p>According to Hoskinson the core goal of Shelley is decentralization. He explains that &rsquo;Byron&rsquo;, the previous product release, was all about community and introducing the concept of Cardano to the world. </p><p>&ldquo;Building support, getting listed on exchanges, getting APIs [application programming interface] right and being able to build a help desk process and getting a community management right. That&rsquo;s very hard to do. Now we have regular releases, an ecosystem and great infrastructure. Now, that we have that, we start moving from a top down model to a more of a decentralized ecosystem,&rdquo; said Hoskinson. </p><p>Separately, IOHK has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ethiopian government to train and hire junior software developers and use Cardano in its agriculture industry. Another initiative launched in Africa involved women from Ethiopia and Uganda have also being taught to code and get to grips with Haskell which is the most important programming language used by IOHK. </p><p><b>ADA price chart:</b></p><figure><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5cd/1878e57b6c.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5cd/1878e57b6c.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5cd/1878e57b6c.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5cd/1878e57b6c.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5cd/1878e57b6c.png 900w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>May 7, 13:27 UTC</figcaption></figure>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The promise of an open financial system, cross-border transactions for all, that was sparked by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, is still as alive as ever,&rdquo; Kavita Gupta, who runs a USD 50 million investment fund as Founding Managing Partner at <b>ConsenSys Ventures</b>, told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/1562fcdce8.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5c0/1562fcdce8.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5c0/1562fcdce8.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5c0/1562fcdce8.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5c0/1562fcdce8.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5c0/1562fcdce8.jpg 1200w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Kavita Gupta. Source: ConsenSys</figcaption></figure><p>The company is an external investment arm of <b>ConsenSys</b>, a major blockchain software technology firm. It invests in pre-seed and seed stage <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> projects across the Web 3.0 stack.</p><p>Over the years, Gupta has held several senior investment roles and in this exclusive interview she shares her thoughts on the evolution of cryptocurrencies, how the funding landscape is changing &mdash;  and the importance of creating a healthy environment for women to flourish in the tech sector.</p><p><b>Cryptonews.com: As the crypto landscape evolves what is your view on digital currencies?  </b></p><p><b>Kavita Gupta:</b> I think that the promise of an open financial system, cross-border transactions for all, that was sparked by Bitcoin, is still as alive as ever. Digital currencies and the promise of anyone being able to access their assets from anywhere in the world are as tantalizing today as it was in 2008, perhaps even more so. You can point to crises in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/venezuela-crisis-is-a-great-chance-for-crypto-adoption-2492.htm">Venezuela</a>, Cuba, the friction of cross-border <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/paypal-s-remittance-crown-is-safe-from-crypto-for-now-1711.htm">remittance</a> or constant hacks (such as the one <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/09/pf/equifax-hack-senate-disclosure/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced by</a> <b>Equifax</b>) as a proof of this. Now, do I think that tokenizing fiat in the way <b>Circle</b>, <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a></b>, and <b>Gemini</b> have done recently is super revolutionary? <i>(Here, Kavita Gupta is referencing to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usd-coin-circles-tether-2677.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stablecoins</a> launched by the mentioned companies &#8211; Cryptonews.com)</i> Not really. Although, I do think these will serve as a massive user experience upgrade to the decentralized web and these fiat backed tokens is definitely innovative for institutions. </p><p><b>How is the venture capital (VC), funding landscape changing? </b></p><p>I think VC investors are getting comfortable with this new paradigm of investing. Crypto investing looks a lot different: liquidity, duration, risk profile, volatility etc. are very different than the long-term traditional investment fund. The landscape is also changing for blockchain investors and the profile of entrepreneurs is changing. We see a shift from majority of young technologists serving as CEOs to a lot of  seasoned engineers and serial entrepreneurs entering the space. Product&#8217;s vision, roadmap and especially the thought of adoption and user friendly interface have become a big part of the conversation. Some of the big VC&#8217;s are setting up crypto dedicated funds bringing Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 worlds closer and validating lots of early tech in the space, which just a year ago would have looked fake. </p><p><b>What type of projects have you recently invested in?</b> </p><p>Our two newest publicly announced investments are both incredibly exciting. The first, <b>Unlock</b>, is a protocol that allows content publishers to set up paywalls for their content without a middleman. It will eventually lead to people being able to micro-monetize their content, charge a few cents for an article or even a fraction of that for a tweet, etc. With only a few lines of code, anyone on the web can integrate Unlock&#8217;s paywall-as-a-service, and they&#8217;ll pivot into other areas of digital monetization, too.</p><p>Another in <b>Starkware</b>, an innovative cryptography project out of Israel that&#8217;s making major waves in the crypto industry. Without getting too technical, Starkware&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a> have drastically improved on the Snark technology (used by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zcash/">Zcash</a> and others), allowing for private and highly scalable transactions. Once they reach full industrial grade, Starks will be a part of every blockchain, and can eventually even serve as the base layer for a new protocol.</p><p>We started with the investment thesis of investing across the whole Ethereum stack, but the space is becoming very exciting for infrastructure, scalability and security products right now. </p><p><b>What advice can you share with aspiring women in tech? What challenges have you faced as a female in tech?  </b></p><p>Tech is like any other field in this world. It may look male dominated right now but doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t change it. As individuals, our first responsibility is to pursue what you really love and excel in it. </p><p>Be strong and speak up if someone or something is making you uncomfortable.  Have a non defensive and honest conversation with your colleagues or seniors over coffee the first time you notice a pattern which makes you uncomfortable. If that doesn&#8217;t solve the problem then speak up in [public] if the pattern continues. Find other women in the space and create a safe environment to have a support system and open conversation. The more you support each other and stand up &#8211; the more you would contribute in creating a healthy space for more women to follow. </p><p>I have been blessed with some of the most supporting mentors and bosses in my life, but irrespective, I have never stayed quiet if I saw a pattern of rejection based on sex or color. I did question myself on my abilities at first, but having a confidence in my work and support system at work has always helped me to see through situations and gave me confidence to stand up as needed.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Long term, the biggest adoption challenges remain psychological,&rdquo; Meltem Demirors, a cryptocurrency investor, Chief Strategy Officer at <b>CoinShares</b>, a crypto focused investment company, told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b9/8e308460b3.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b9/8e308460b3.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b9/8e308460b3.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b9/8e308460b3.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b9/8e308460b3.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b9/8e308460b3.jpg 4075w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Meltem Demirors</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;People will tell you it&#8217;s infrastructure, custody, trading venues, indexation, and a number of other market design problems. I fundamentally disagree,&rdquo; she added. </p><p>In this exclusive interview, Demirors who has a unique blend of experience in both legacy &amp; blockchain-based finance and cryptocurrencies shares her thoughts on why venture capital (VC) is dead, market liquidity and what challenges security tokens and initial coin offerings (ICOs) face. </p><p>Read the whole interview below.</p><p><b>Will we see a widespread shift toward digital currencies? </b></p><p>Digital currencies, or the innovation of how sound money is created, is an innovation whose significance most of the world still hasn&rsquo;t fully grasped. I continue to believe digital currencies will speed the evolution from physical economies defined by nation-states towards digital and virtual economies defined by shared sets of principles and beliefs. <br>
The vision of digital assets native to systems &amp; networks, i.e., tokens is an appealing one, but one that&rsquo;s been implemented poorly in most cases through, appallingly bad incentive design via ICOs. </p><p><b>Do you have any concerns? </b></p><p>I wish more projects would question the design of digital assets instead of blindly repeating the same copy-paste token formula. I don&rsquo;t see a world where users or developers will adopt a new system when VCs and wealthy investors own 80% or more of the resources in that system.  </p><p><b>What do you expect to happen in the security tokens field in 2019?</b></p><p>Security tokens, in the form the market is currently talking about, present only marginal, incremental innovation in my opinion. There is this (pervasive) erroneous belief in the crypto ecosystem that creating supply will lead to a rise in demand. Tokenizing a bunch of assets via securitization isn&rsquo;t going to suddenly create a steep function increase in demand for these assets. We will see many security tokens launch to great acclaim, but few will achieve the liquidity and transferability hoped for. Financial markets are some of the most regulated markets in the world, and no amount of tokens will change regulation overnight. </p><figure class="left"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b9/8e3370c751.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5b9/8e3370c751.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5b9/8e3370c751.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5b9/8e3370c751.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5b9/8e3370c751.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5b9/8e3370c751.png 394w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Meltem Demirors served as Vice President of Development at Digital Currency Group (DCG), she also managed DCG&rsquo;s network of corporate partners and investors, including some of the world&rsquo;s largest financial institutions. Prior to DCG, she held roles at ExxonMobil and Deloitte. Demirors holds a BA in Mathematical Economics from Rice University and an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management. She serves on the World Economic Forum Blockchain Council, and lectures at the MIT Media Lab and the Oxford Sa&iuml;d School of Business.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Liquidity remains one of the biggest roadblocks to widespread adoption of security tokens &#8211; how can this be tackled? </b></p><p>Liquidity is a poorly understood concept. Most people think liquidity means something is readily salable or marketable. According to Investopedia, liquidity is defined as the degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset&rsquo;s price. Liquidity is therefore a function of supply and demand for security tokens, as well as a function of investor confidence, market concentration, and market psychology. Untangling that &#8211; I think security tokens will continue to struggle with liquidity just as ICOs have. When a dozen investors own 20%-30% of the supply and share similar market psychologies, the market will continue to be volatile and liquidity will continue to be elusive. </p><p>This is the problem of coupling technology with finance &#8211; an investor&rsquo;s mentality or psychology is notoriously irrational. You can engineer the most logical asset or market or system &#8211; but it all breaks down when human psychology gets involved, leaving engineers baffled when technical design breaks down at a core level. Right now, the &#8216;shitcoin waterfall,&#8217; i.e. traders and funds moving to dump coins the fastest once there&rsquo;s tradability, is symptomatic of the lack of long term conviction in most of these assets &#8211; regardless of whether they&rsquo;re digital currencies, tokens, or securities. </p><p>Long term, the biggest adoption challenges remain psychological. People will tell you its infrastructure, custody, trading venues, indexation, and a number of other market design problems. I fundamentally disagree. We need confident investors who have long term conviction and a market sufficiently robust and diversified to endure lapses of conviction or faith. Until then, any sort of movement in the market will inevitably move price &#8211; and therefore, limit liquidity.</p><p><b>You&rsquo;ve previously said venture capital is dead. How is the funding landscape changing?  </b></p><p>In my view, there are really only a small handful of VCs, say 5%, that are actually &ldquo;good&rdquo; at what they do. Objectively, it&rsquo;s difficult to measure performance because of the timing mismatch between when an investor writes a check and when a company has a material liquidity event. The fundamental challenge with VC is a challenge similar to that faced by ICOs &#8211; incentives. The power dynamic between investors and entrepreneurs has long been a strange one &#8211; as evidenced by recent events including rampant sexual harassment, fraud, and abuse revealed over the last year and continuing to come to light. ICOs are likely not the best funding mechanism, but they have helped founders understand that there is now an alternative option. Venture as a mechanism hasn&rsquo;t seen much innovation since its beginnings in Silicon Valley. The world is now asking &#8211; what if we changed the model for capital formation?</p><p><b>Can you compare how the crowdfunding model differs from ICOs? </b></p><p>Crowdfunding didn&rsquo;t work, aggregation and curation through platforms like AngelList was marginally successful &#8211; but ICOs opened up a whole new frontier. Founders now have choice. Founders have found a new medium for experimentation. You can now fundraise from a larger group of investors who are more ideologically aligned with you. Can you start to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; bad investors? I&rsquo;m working with one of my portfolio companies on this concept &#8211; a clawback / buyback of equity from certain investors. Re-balancing the power dynamic between those with capital (VCs) and those with ideas (entrepreneurs) and everyone in between is much needed &#8211; and while there&rsquo;s still much work to do, blockchain technology as a fundraising medium is presenting a compelling and cogent alternative. </p><p>I spent three years building the investment of &ldquo;post-investment portfolio management&rdquo; at <b>Digital Currency Group</b>, and the hundreds of crypto founders I worked with there and now at my own firm will (hopefully) can attest to the importance of having a post-investment strategy. I am excited to see the rise of more investment firms that incorporate this practice &ndash; what happens once a check gets written &ndash; because arguably that&rsquo;s the hardest part of being an investor and where projects and companies need the most help. For too long, too many investors have gotten a free ride off other investors who are willing to do the hard work to help companies grow. No more!</p><p><b>As the crypto landscape evolves, what is your vision for CoinShares? </b></p><p>CoinShares has been a leader in bringing digital assets to market through new and unique structures. Our history is one of working through challenges to bring professional products to market. While CoinShares&rsquo; core business has historically been asset management, I am excited to play a pivotal role in shaping our future to play a more material role in networks and markets &#8211; not just as an asset manager but as an advisor, partner, and category creator when it comes to financial products and services for retail and institutional investors as well as crypto firms.</p>

What attracted you to the technology and what&rsquo;s your view on the future of crypto?</b></p><p>I think that the blockchain technology is the natural evolution of the technology cycle we&#8217;ve been in since the 1950s. There&#8217;s a fourteen year cycle that occurs around significant innovations related to computing power. So, in 1954 we had the mainframe and in 1968 we had the microchip, in 1982 we had the personal computer, in 1996 we had the internet, in 2010 we had the mobile net, and in 2024, I think, we&#8217;ll have the internet of value. The internet of value is really going to be driven by blockchain technology. So blockchain technology is again the evolution of directing computing power toward these related technologies that have cryptography, distributed ledger, trust, etc. And blockchain allows us for the first time to treat ownership and value things like money and property and business ownership in a digital format.</p><p><b>In March, Morgan Creek Capital Management acquired investment startup Full Tilt Capital [In January, North Carolina-based firm focusing on seed-round investments, announced that it was dedicating its next fund entirely to cryptocurrency businesses]. Why?</b></p><p>Yes, about eighteen months ago I came across Pomp [Anthony Pompliano, the managing partner of Full Tilt Capital] on Twitter. Anthony was involved in a couple of start-ups, went to work at <b>Facebook</b>, got recruited to <b>Snap</b> [an American tech giant] and then he came back home to North Carolina. </p><p>Pomp was really insightful in what was coming down the pipe, particularly in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/security-token/">security tokens</a>. Make a long story short, I said, &ldquo;hey, we should figure out a way to work together&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you just acquire us.&rdquo; He and his partner had run seed stage venture capital fund and they&rsquo;d done a second stage of investing.  So we were a little way down the road of launching a Blockchain opportunity fund and I realised the importance of having a team.</p><p><b>What&rsquo;s your view on the attempts to launch a bitcoin ETF in the U.S.? </b></p><p>When it comes to approving or not approving a bitcoin ETF, their [The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC] concerns on custody, the potential for hacking have still not been addressed. So I understand they&#8217;re concerned about that. </p><p>If you look at the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/investment-opportunity-blockchain-etfs-1336.htm">Blockchain ETFs</a>, they&#8217;re basically just index fund and that is a silly idea. A Bitcoin ETF is actually an interesting idea because it will democratize access to this asset. I give a standing ovation to the SEC over the past couple of years, as they&#8217;ve approached regulating and investigating this nascent industry and I think they&#8217;ve done everything right. I think they have been prudent, disciplined and consistent.</p><p>My own personal opinion is that the SEC is unlikely to approve something on August 10th.</p><p>I think we get a little disappointment break after that. And prices will fall again. And we&#8217;ll have one last dip before the fourth quarter big rally. Who knows where we end up, but that is how I see things going.</p><p><b>What do you predict for the bitcoin / cryptocurrencies for the next months? </b></p><p>I tweeted back in April that USD 25,000 [per bitcoin] is the number for the end of this year and we [together with Pomp] both come to our numbers in a similar fashion. So we both use at the underlying an estimate of what the network value is worth. </p><oembed url="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1021949915835101184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></oembed><p>If you look at the history of Bitcoin price, this is how it moves &#8211; it has a parabolic move and then a crash, then a parabolic move and a crash, and that&#8217;s the way technology is adopted. </p><p>There were five of these parabolic moves, and we&#8217;ll have a 6th, 7th, and 8th, and 9th, and it is just the way it works. So I don&#8217;t think you need a big event, and you&#8217;ve seen it in the past couple of weeks, right? As soon as the price starts to run, those people that have been waiting on the sidelines to make sure that the bear market is over are ready to jump in. And once it actually starts moving, then it starts moving fast and that&#8217;s when you get those parabolic moves.</p>

Once all procedures are completed, the two chains emerge independently. For example, Bitcoin Cash cryptocurrency was born after a hard fork from the Bitcoin Core network in August 2017. </p><p>What is the team behind the Monero hard fork trying to achieve? This fork on April 30 is backed by promises to deal with a scalability issue. In addition, Monero V, the forked coin, will be in limited supply. The team behind the fork has also promised to release a simple Monero V full node GUI (graphical user interface) wallet and a web wallet.</p><p><b>So, are hard forks really necessary? </b></p><p>Galia Benartzi, co-founder and head of business development at Bancor, a Swiss-based non-profit focused on solving the liquidity challenge in asset exchange, has seen a number of hard forks and explains that those are one of the many features of blockchain, allowing communities to vote with their feet.  </p><p>&ldquo;You can propose any governance structure you want, but membership in any decentralized ecosystem is voluntary, and the cost of switching is low. We&rsquo;re entering a technological era in which value is created not by locking users in, but by setting users free,&rdquo; Benartzi said.</p><p>According to her, these forks are an example of users taking a codebase they believe to be valuable and optimizing it to their specifications.</p><p><b>Understanding the hard forks in the pipeline</b></p><p>Noam Copel, CEO of the DAV Foundation, a blockchain-based transportation platform, explains that there are some heuristics he uses to analyze pending hard forks. </p><p>&ldquo;I always ask myself: 1) Does the fork solve a real problem? 2) Is the team behind the fork credible and competent? 3) Is there a healthy community and open discussion surrounding the fork? If the answer to any of these three questions is a &#8220;no&#8221;, it raises a red flag for me. I also realize that the pressures created by hype and &#8220;fear of missing out&#8221; could drive a given coin&#8217;s price up despite the lack of solid fundamentals,&rdquo; Copel explained.</p><p>Sergey Shenderov, co-founder and CEO of Mom.life, an app with a focus on new technology and human behavior, added that the fundamental success of any hard fork is mainly defined by the prospects of the lead developer team and the new currency value &ndash; growth in both is evidence of community and market support. </p><p>Shenderov says: &ldquo;Arguably, everything else &ndash; including transactional activity and miners getting on board &ndash; are consequences driven by demonstrated product quality and ensuing market forces. Bitcoin forks also offer the prospect of solving the base chain&#8217;s specific technical &#8220;shortcomings&#8221; at the expense of greater centralization, as any fork is led by specific individual teams.&rdquo;</p><p>Also, when a hard fork happens, cryptocurrency owners might expect to receive some free newly created coins. However, Graeme Moore, vice president for marketing and communications at Polymath, a developer of the securities token platform, warns that users should be extra careful when attempting to claim forked coins and always ensure that there is replay protection and no malicious code. Replay protection makes sure that transactions on one chain are invalid on the other chain.</p><p>Moore says: &ldquo;The cost of creating a hard fork is essentially zero, so we will continue to see more and more hard forks that attempt to create a user base via forking coins to an already established community.&rdquo;</p>

Picture by Token2049 organisers.</figcaption></figure><p>This year we have seen discussion on cryptocurrency regulation increase around the world. From global regulatory agencies to governments and central banks there is rising interest in regulating crypto.  </p><p>&ldquo;If you look at history, if industries that don&rsquo;t self-regulate in the sense that the business leaders don&rsquo;t come together and argue for a code of conduct and a code of practices that becomes uniform across the industry, regulators get involved,&rdquo; said Lingham, speaking on  stage at the largest digital asset event in Asia.  </p><p>He explains that what we are seeing right now is that people are waking up to what he says is the current reality, and that the crypto community cannot survive unless they make a decision &#8211; are they going to sit back and watch the regulators regulate them? Or are they to self-regulate without having external governance? </p><p>Referencing the recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitconnect-disconnects-lending-and-exchange-platform-1035.htm">BitConnect</a> case which is described as a ponzi scheme Lingham warned that people are at risk of putting money into scams and phony schemes. </p><p>&ldquo;These people don&rsquo;t know better so now regulators are stepping up and saying we must protect people. This industry as it is emerging has got a lot of bad actors in it,&rdquo; said Lingham.  </p><p>However, there is a fine line between enforcing regulation and then stifling innovation. Lingham believes that self-regulating is important and that is something which is beginning to happen.  </p><p>He also estimates that the regulation will be under the microscope this year and regulators will come in any case.  </p><p>&ldquo;There are things we can do around that as well in order to prevent too much regulation,&rdquo; the CEO of Civic stressed. </p><p><b>Self-regulation initiatives</b> </p><p>From the UK to India, Croatia, and Japan, crypto-exchanges have recently begun banding together with the aim of not only forming industry-wide associations, but also of drawing up codes of conduct for each other to follow, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/crypto-industry-self-regulating-to-avoid-government-regulati-1250.htm">reported by Cryptonews.com</a> in February. </p><p>However, while it&#8217;s only a good thing that they&#8217;ve begun openly committing to upholding more robust standards, it&#8217;s clear that much of this commitment is being made as a result of threats of stricter government regulation. As such, it&#8217;s not entirely certain whether the associations now being formed will be about actual regulation and enforcement, or more about public relations and government lobbying. </p><p>In addition, last week, Bitcoin billionaires, investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss also proposed a cryptocurrency self-regulatory organization (SRO). </p><p>In a blog post, the Winklevoss brothers write it would &#8220;not provide regulatory programs for security tokens or security token platforms.&rdquo; The brothers believe a thoughtful SRO framework that provides a regulatory program for the virtual commodity industry is the next logical step in the maturation of this market. The Winklevoss&rsquo; are in favor of engaging with industry leaders, participants, regulators, and legislators on this proposal. </p><p>There are a number of crypto market commentators who have been encouraging crypto regulation. Dr. Jeppe Stokholm a partner and general counsel at Black Swan, a VC firm based in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland, told investing.com: &ldquo;The time has come to hold the crypto ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system. I do not fear financial regulation of cryptocurrencies. Instead, I hope it will be implemented as soon as possible in order to get fair competition and a safe marketplace.&rdquo;  </p><p>Meanwhile, G20 countries are unlikely to seek to regulate cryptocurrency trading, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/morning-news-no-regulations-from-g20-japan-faces-crypto-tax-1426.htm">as reported today</a>. Media reports quote anonymous sources at the summit of finance ministers and central bank governors being held in Buenos Aires as saying the participants cannot come to an agreement on the matter &ndash; and will likely postpone any further action until at least November, when finance ministers and leaders of the countries meet again. Many governments, including those of Japan and France, were hoping to come to a mutual agreement on regulations, but other participants appear to prefer a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency investors are well aware that regulation is inevitable. Will 2018 be the year we see regulation enforced? Is it possible to implement a one-size-fits-all approach with global regulators working together to regulate the sector? </p><p>&ldquo;Fact is, that even though blockchain technology does not by-pass existing laws and regulations, the blockchain (r)evolution is still in its Wild West phase,&rdquo; wrote Dr. Jeppe R. Stokholm, partner and general counsel at Black Swan, a Swiss venture capital firm. </p><p>He asks the &ldquo;multi-billion-dollar question&rdquo;: If no international standards exists, how can we then define and solve the legal impact of the Blockchain technology related to crypto currencies, crypto securities and smart contracts, assets and things?</p><p>While the question remains unanswered, <i>Cryptonews.com</i> spoke to some of the industry experts to find out their opinion about the &lsquo;Wild West&rsquo; in the blockchain world and its regulation.</p><p>As there are more signs of attempts to regulate the crypto space, industry players warn not to hamper innovation and doubt that global regulation is possible.  </p><p>&ldquo;Regulation that still allows innovation is a great thing because it means the space is maturing, and regulators want to ensure fair and orderly business operations. There is no turning back. These technologies are here to stay and will provide a better, more decentralized future,&rdquo; said Graeme Moore, vice president for marketing and communications at Polymath, a developer of the securities token platform. </p><p>Ted O&#8217;Neill, founder and chairman of the blockchain-based content platform Narrative agrees that more regulation is probably inevitable as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, but this could be counterproductive for the sector.  </p><p>&ldquo;If it becomes too regulated, its value diminishes, which is perhaps a goal of many governments and institutions. I&rsquo;d prefer to see governments take the stance that Japan has, legitimizing cryptocurrency and encouraging its adoption,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill.</p><p><b>Different agendas </b></p><p>The chairman of Narrative added that he &ldquo;would be shocked&rdquo; if there were any kind of global rules regarding crypto as too many governments have vastly different agendas. Nawid Habib founder of ICO HeadStart, an ICO (initial coin offering) fundraising platform, shares the same opinion: &#8220;The international cooperation in regard to this matter is quite hard to realize. States within certain unions have different opinions, let alone if you take all countries around the world into consideration.&rdquo; </p><p>While O&rsquo;Neill added that most governments cannot even decide if crypto should be classified as a currency or as an asset/property.  </p><p>&ldquo;The beauty of crypto is that it empowers people in a way that is antithetical to most government agendas. The freedom and accessibility we associate with crypto are truly endangered if we over-regulate,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill stressed.</p><p>Oscar Hartmann, co-founder of the VLB (Vehicle Lifecycle Blockchain) project believes that we are moving towards a &ldquo;more definitive stance&rdquo; and that various state regulators around the world are talking in relation to the crypto asset space. </p><p>&ldquo;Some of the regulators prefer a more welcoming and amicable approach &ndash; recognizing both the great potential of the emergence of such assets and the underlying technology, as well as the inevitability of the social and economic progress they represent,&rdquo; Hartmann told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><p>Others place emphasis on their determination to protect consumers from the &#8220;wild western&#8221; nature of this rapidly growing space. According to Hartmann, this is not necessarily a bad thing, as it gives the honest players a set of rules they could follow without any uncertainty.</p><p>&ldquo;[The uncertainty], by the way, is way more unhealthy for the space,&rdquo; co-founder of VLB added.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two students at ESMT Berlin have already paid their tuition fees in cryptocurrency since the business school began accepting it as a payment method in December 2016, Georg Garlichs, Chief Financial Officer of ESMT told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;There was one student from Vietnam who used Bitcoin due to the difficulty in sending a wire transfer, and there was another lady who wanted to join us from Brazil,&rdquo; Garlichs added. </p><p>The decision to accept cryptocurrency was a very practical one. Approximately 85% of ESMT students come from abroad and this includes non-EU countries such as Brazil, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. Therefore when it comes to making a payment there is often a lengthy and expensive process. </p><p>&ldquo;I became aware of the Bitcoin concept at a Blockchain contest award ceremony we held here [in May 2016]. I tried it and played with it with small amounts and sent portions of bitcoins back and forth. Then, I sent them to an exchange and sold them and it all worked very well,&rdquo; Garlichs explained. </p><p>The private institution has not just limited itself to accepting Bitcoin, with tuition fees also payable in Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash.  </p><p>However, it was not all smooth sailing for ESMT and there has been some rejection along the way. The largest German crypto exchange Bitcoin.de would not accept ESMT as a client when approached, because they did not accept institutions as customers at the time.  </p><p>&ldquo;After they said no, we went to Kraken. It is too bad that [Bitcoin.de] would not accept us. As a private individual there is not a problem but as an institution they would not accept us,&rdquo; said Garlichs. </p><p>He added that ESMT is keen to ride the crypto wave further &#8211; in 2018 there are a number of courses available to those students who want to learn more about trends such as the blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Initial Coin Offerings.</p>
