Even if it only goes up only half as much as in 2017, it&rsquo;s still going to top USD 325,000! Either way, it&rsquo;s shaping up to be d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu all over again &hellip;</p><p>Although bitcoin&rsquo;s fevered advance seems to have temporarily stalled just shy of USD 40,000, its epic rally over the last three months has taken out one resistance level after another.</p><p>For example, it was only mid-December when Bitcoin finally broke above major overhead resistance coinciding with its 2017 high (near USD 20,000).</p><p>After that, it shot up more than 100% in just three weeks, climbing as high as USD 41,000 (and change) on an intra-day basis.</p><p>Along the way, bitcoin also made more money for investors in 2020 than any other major asset class. It outperformed US stocks and long-term government bonds, roughly 16-to-1.</p><p>Bitcoin outpaced gold by 12-to-1 last year, and US Treasuries, by a remarkable 99-to-1.</p><p>A performance like this commands attention. This is why we&rsquo;re starting to see sentiment in favor of crypto pretty much across the board.</p><p>Tech companies, hedge funds, and other big investors who once eschewed all things crypto are now tip-toeing gingerly in. For example &hellip;</p><ul><li>Asked why he was scooping up bitcoin for his hedge fund, billionaire investor <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sovereigns-will-for-sure-fight-against-private-crypto-paul-t-8521.htm">Paul Tudor Jones</a> said Bitcoin was the &#8220;fastest horse&#8221; in the race to beat inflation &mdash; ignited by flagrant money-printing.</li><li>The <b>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</b> recently took advantage of bitcoin&rsquo;s pullback to scoop up BTC 10,000, boosting total assets under management above USD 22bn.</li><li>Business intelligence firm <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/microstrategy/">MicroStrategy</a></b> recently invested over USD 400 million in BTC. And then <b>Morgan Stanley</b> purchased 9% of MicroStrategy &mdash; precisely to boost its exposure (albeit indirectly) to bitcoin.</li><li>Wyoming just awarded US crypto exchange <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kraken</a></b> a license to create a crypto bank. Tentatively named <b>Kraken Financial</b>, it will operate blockchain payment systems and issue crypto debit cards. Customers will be soon able to open crypto savings accounts, as well as pay bills and receive salaries in crypto.</li><li>Wyoming also awarded <b>Avanti Financial Group</b> a charter to open a second crypto bank. And not to be outdone, the US Comptroller of the Currency has given the <b>Anchorage Digital Bank National Association</b> the green light to establish and operate America&rsquo;s first federally chartered digital bank.</li><li><b>New York Stock Exchange</b> (NYSE) sister company <b>Bakkt Holdings</b>, which runs a Bitcoin futures market, just got <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bakkt-predicting-sky-high-growth-for-usd-3-trillion-crypto-s-8874.htm">clearance to go public</a> in a deal worth an estimated USD 2.1bn. And few companies are more symbolic of middle-of-the-road investing than the NYSE.</li></ul><p>So, you see, not only is sentiment shifting broadly in favor of crypto, it&rsquo;s positively going mainstream. This is massively bullish for bitcoin.</p><p>But in case you still think lightning can&rsquo;t strike twice &hellip; that another 2017-like season cannot possibly lie ahead for bitcoin in 2021 &hellip; consider this: By their very nature, certain crypto assets have &hellip;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="an-intrinsic-affinity-for-&lt;i&gt;parabolic&lt;/i&gt;-breakouts">An intrinsic affinity for <i>parabolic</i> breakouts</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The reason is simple. In virtually every conventional financial asset class, sharply rising prices lead to expanding supplies &mdash; which then act to dampen further price gains.</p><p>When stock prices rise sharply, for example, investment bankers bring to market a flood of new listings.</p><p>When gold prices shoot up, miners take advantage of them to develop lower-grade deposits that were previously uneconomic to produce.</p><p>When property prices go through the roof, real estate developers sometimes even expand into flood plains, or drain swamps in order to obtain more square footage to sell.</p><p>Bitcoin simply doesn&rsquo;t work that way. That&rsquo;s because it has a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/attempts-to-increase-bitcoin-s-supply-would-end-up-with-anot-6030.htm">hard ceiling</a> on how many coins can <i>ever</i> be produced (21 million) &mdash; no matter what happens to prices.</p><p>So, what happens when surging demand for crypto &mdash; like we&rsquo;re starting to see now &mdash; collides with inelastic supply?</p><p>Prices have nowhere to go but up. That&rsquo;s just Economics 101.</p><p>This is why crypto markets routinely go into exponential parabolic uptrends &hellip; only to crash back down, recover and then shoot for the stars again.</p><p>On top of that, every time a crypto bubble pops, valuations never actually come back down to where they were before.</p><p>That&rsquo;s because each successive bubble brings in new people, many of which never leave.</p><p>In fact, this is how the crypto universe grows: By sucking new people in during bull runs. Then, by consolidating and expanding infrastructure during the bear markets that inevitably ensue.</p><p>And all this, of course, merely lays the groundwork for the next parabolic upsurge. When even more folks jump into the bandwagon.</p><p>How long will these dynamics play out?  Hard to say for sure. But even this bull market likely still has close to another year or so to run.  <br>

That would indeed be a scary-drastic price movement in other, old-school financial markets. But &mdash; and you have to be prepared for this &mdash; this is perfectly normal behavior for cryptocurrencies.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1349451161309507584"></oembed></div><p>Meanwhile, altcoins have been making moves while bitcoin is stalling.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dot-polkadot/">Polkadot (DOT)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/chainlink/">chainlink (LINK)</a> have led a group of altcoins to new all-time highs this week.

Bitcoin and, on a smaller scale, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a> tend to lead the market on the way up during bull runs.</p><p>Once bitcoin starts to trade sideways or investors take some profits, some of that money flows into altcoins.

Often, these altcoins can see much larger returns than bitcoin due to their smaller market capitalizations.</p><p>We could be seeing the early signs of a new market phase, evidenced by new highs for these altcoins. </p><p>One of the altcoin segments that might see even more investor attention &mdash; and therefore even more outsized returns &mdash; is &ldquo;decentralized finance,&rdquo; or DeFi, the 2020 crypto industry darling.</p><p>After the 2020 DeFi summer, more people now know about these coins, and they might turn their attention that way once this altcoin season begins. We&rsquo;re keeping a close eye on what we consider to be DeFi blue chips.</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1350113326123122688"></oembed></div><p>Altcoin seasons tend to be some of the most fun times in the cryptocurrency markets.

We&rsquo;re going to go with the latter.</p><p>BTC slid from about USD 41,000 on Sunday morning to the USD 33,000 neighborhood by Monday morning. That&rsquo;s a decline of approximately 20%. After weeks and weeks of nothing but new all-time highs, a lot of analysts had been calling for a pullback, and it seems they&rsquo;ve had their prognostications fulfilled.</p><p>Good for them. But good for us too &mdash; especially those of you who haven&rsquo;t yet begun to participate in crypto markets. This &mdash; as they say &mdash; might be the opportunity you&rsquo;ve been looking for &hellip;</p><p>As we <a href="https://weisscrypto.com/en/article/bitcoin-soars-past-20-000-to-all-time-highs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> on Dec. 18, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised if we see a small correction soon, as our timing model suggests we may see a brief pullback before the long-term crypto bull-market resumes.&rdquo;</p><p>Our timing could have been better. But this is a move that we saw coming.</p><p>On that note, let&rsquo;s put this price pullback into context:</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1348474705553063941"></oembed></div><p>As <b>Messari</b> so eloquently put it, even though bitcoin has dropped around USD 8,000 from its all-time high, we were trading at these levels just six days ago. Bitcoin&rsquo;s been gaining so quickly lately that it&rsquo;s easy to lose perspective.</p><p>That happens during these types of bull runs &mdash; the old school would say &ldquo;irrational exuberance.&rdquo;</p><p>And with huge price gains come sharp pullbacks. That&rsquo;s the story with crypto; big moves come with exploration of all new territory.</p><p>At the same time, the cryptocurrency market is maturing. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re calm today. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some fundamental metrics for Bitcoin &hellip;</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/LinaSeiche/status/1348564435812626434"></oembed></div><p>Higher hash rate and difficulty means higher processing power of the Bitcoin network, as well as even greater network security.</p><p>That means that, even though we&rsquo;re seeing a small correction in the market, the strength and security of the Bitcoin network are at all-time highs.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t forget that this entire Bitcoin bull action is built on top of massive value in a network that continues to grow stronger and more sound over time.</p><p>Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t the only network advancing in strength and functionality, either, as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-2-0-s-phase-0-goes-live-successfully-8481.htm">Ethereum 2.0 launch has started</a> and will only continue to grow and add functionality over time.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s close out on an interesting piece of investment news that means we might have an easier time filing crypto taxes in the near future &hellip;</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1347546114673823747"></oembed></div><p>Folks, markets correct. Right now, crypto markets correct dramatically. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to get swept up in the emotion. Signs of maturity abound. And market capitalization for bitcoin &mdash; and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a> &mdash; will rise with maturity.</p><p>Focus on the increasingly data-driven fundamental case that points to a much higher BTC from here over the long term.<br>

Since then &hellip;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="central-banks-have-become-primary-shapers-of-economic-policy-across-the-western-world">Central Banks Have Become Primary Shapers of Economic Policy Across the Western World</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Central bankers are broadly insulated from the politicking that customarily takes place in parliaments, congresses or even the courts.</p><p>They are also largely unconstrained by the comings and goings of elected officials.</p><p>That basically leaves them free to pursue almost any policy they deem appropriate. And here, their policy response to the 2008 global financial crisis looms large:</p><figure style="max-width: 389px"><a href="https://finance.weissratings.com/media/images/newsletters/2020/WCA120920_1.png" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5fd/8f650d5745.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 389px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5fd/8f650d5745.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5fd/8f650d5745.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5fd/8f650d5745.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5fd/8f650d5745.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5fd/8f650d5745.png 389w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>Figure 1. Monthly assets on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</figcaption></figure><p>Massive monetary interventions in the form of near-zero interest rates and wholesale money-printing.</p><p>Of course, it could be argued that, without these monetary excesses, the global financial system would have collapsed in 2008.</p><p>It could also be argued that the mid-2010s European debt crisis would have destroyed the Eurozone and the euro. Or that the world economy would have been by crushed by COVID lockdowns in 2020.</p><p>Be that as it may, these excesses also caused tremendous collateral damage. Unprecedented asset price inflation. And a society-crippling surge in inequality.</p><p>Folks wealthy enough to hold assets saw their net worth explode post-2008. While people living paycheck-to-paycheck watched the real value of their income shrink to a tiny fraction of what it once was.</p><p>We take no pleasure in saying this, but these trends are going to continue, no matter what finally emerges from the revolving door of Presidential elections.</p><p>A gridlocked, dysfunctional government practically guarantees central banks will once again step in to fill in the void. This is the world we live in.</p><p>Permanent asset price inflation is now the official policy of those holding the levers of monetary power. And these high priests of money and finance are going to keep their collective foot on the gas to prop up a hopelessly hyper-indebted system.</p><p>And, thus, kick the can down the road just a little further. Because of this, investors&rsquo; demand for safe-haven assets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and gold has nowhere to go but up in the months ahead. However &hellip;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoin-has-a-little-recognized-but-key-advantage-over-gold">Bitcoin Has A Little-Recognized, But Key Advantage Over Gold</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>With gold, higher prices soon lead to expanding supply. For example, higher gold prices mean miners can profitably mine lower-grade ore that was previously uneconomic to produce. And such supply increases naturally work <i>against</i> sharply rising gold prices.</p><p>Bitcoin, however, doesn&rsquo;t work that way. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/attempts-to-increase-bitcoin-s-supply-would-end-up-with-anot-6030.htm">hard ceiling on supply</a>, defined and fixed by the blockchain. No more than 21 million BTC can (or ever will) be created &mdash; no matter what prices or market conditions may be.</p><p>So, what happens when surging investment demand collides with fixed supply? Prices go ballistic. That&rsquo;s Economics 101.</p><p>This also explains why crypto markets are prone to go into exponential parabolic uptrends &hellip; only to crash back down, recover, then shoot for the stars again.</p><p>On top of that, every time a crypto bubble pops, valuations never actually come all the way back down to where they were before. That&rsquo;s because each successive bubble brings new people into the crypto universe &mdash; many of whom <i>never</i> leave.</p><p>This is how the crypto industry grows. By sucking people in during bull runs. Then, by consolidating and expanding infrastructure during the bear markets that inevitably ensue.</p><p>Which, of course, lays the groundwork for the next parabolic upsurge &#8230; when even more folks jump into the bandwagon.</p><p>How long will these dynamics play out? As long as global central banks remain hell-bent on their present policies.<br>

</figcaption></figure><p>As global markets rushed to price in a speedy post-pandemic recovery, fears about what the future might hold naturally dissipated.</p><p>That jerked the rug out from under safe-haven investments &mdash; like gold and government bonds. So, as you can see, they both rolled off the edge of a table together.</p><p>Bitcoin, on the other hand &mdash; despite being a key safe-haven investment in its own right &mdash; stood strong. Moreover, this remarkable divergence of direction still continues.</p><p>Gold prices have basically been dead-in-the water ever since. Bonds managed to claw back only about two-thirds of their post-Pfizer plunge.</p><p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, blasted through USD 17,000, USD 18,000, and USD 19,000 &mdash; in short order.</p><p>More and more, this reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is much more than just a safe-haven when it comes to store-of-value assets.</p><p>The investment world is becoming more and more bullish on it by the day. You can also see this in how virtually every major dip in bitcoin prices this year has evoked a flurry of bargain-hunting buying.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s not all: Anticipation of a post-COVID world has also roused a previously sleepy sector of the crypto markets: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a> and the altcoins.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="bitcoin-vs.-altcoins">Bitcoin vs. Altcoins</h3><figure><a href="https://finance.weissratings.com/media/images/newsletters/2020/WCA112520_Fig2.png" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5fc/34aa9825a0.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5fc/34aa9825a0.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5fc/34aa9825a0.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5fc/34aa9825a0.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5fc/34aa9825a0.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5fc/34aa9825a0.png 1430w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>Percentage change in Bitcoin (in blue) vs. the altcoins (in yellow) the day Pfizer announced a working COVID-19 vaccine.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, when the Pfizer news broke, both bitcoin and the altcoins initially went down together &mdash; in sympathy with the safe-haven sell-off. But only for a few minutes. Then, they both reversed course and made a spirited move to the upside.</p><p>This is a big deal, because ever since bitcoin began to rebound from the September crypto correction, the altcoins have been pretty much stuck-in-the-mud.</p><p>That&rsquo;s absolutely not the case anymore. Bitcoin and the altcoins are now both powering higher. Together.</p><p>This is happening while traditional safe havens are struggling, making this even more impressive. It all confirms something we&rsquo;ve been saying for a long time:</p><ul><li>Crypto assets stand alone at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and sound money.</li><li>That makes them the only sure defense against the coming digitization of fiat monies and the reckless monetary policies they will accelerate.</li></ul><p>We are fast approaching a post-COVID world where the only viable safe haven will be crypto. Think about it.</p><ul><li>The value of government bonds can be inflated away at will by un-elected central bank bureaucrats. And once fiat currencies become digital, they will have the technology to inflate at light speed.</li><li>Gold may indeed be beyond the government&rsquo;s ability to corrupt. But it&rsquo;s so heavy and hard to store that confiscation-proof ownership is difficult to achieve.</li><li>Only cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin) stored on decentralized blockchains allow you to keep complete, direct control of your own assets. No matter how out-of-favor &mdash; or targeted &mdash; you may be by powerful government or gangland figures.</li></ul><p>As the world slowly but surely wakes up to this reality, crypto assets are going to enter their most explosive bull market run ever. And it may not be very far away.<br>

It was a huge success.</p><p>More than 2 million people queued up for a chance to become one of just 50,000 trial users.</p><p>This is the first major central bank digital currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDC</a>) released in the real world. But it will not be the last. The <b>Bank of France</b> and the <b>European Central Bank</b> are both <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-sends-another-confirmation-of-a-global-currency-war-7889.htm">racing</a> to create a digital euro.</p><p>The <b>International Monetary Fund</b> (IMF) recently held a conference on how CBDCs could speed up and lower the cost of cross-border payments.</p><p>The <b>US Federal Reserve</b> has also been mulling a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/digital-dollar/">digital dollar</a>. In fact, legislation to establish and implement it has already been proposed in Congress.</p><p>So, in the words of the prophet Daniel: The writing is on the wall.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="why-digital-versions-of-fiat-money-will-be-the-enemies-of-democracy">Why digital versions of fiat money will be the enemies of democracy</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>CBDCs are being sold to the public as a tech upgrade to make payments and transfers faster and free of transaction costs.</p><p>For example, citizens would each have their own digital accounts at the central bank. To pay a bill, you would just use your smartphone to transfer CBDCs from your account to the account of whoever you owe.</p><p>Indeed, this is very much how online access to <i>existing</i> bank accounts already works. Which explains why Shenzhen residents so readily embraced the digital yuan.</p><p>But once CBDCs roll out nationwide, privately-owned commercial banks are going to face a not-so-distant future in which they could be effectively out of business. Because most transactions would take place between accounts at the central bank, making them unnecessary.</p><p>However, this is only part of a more ominous story. Some countries will be tempted to use CBDCs to create a system like this:</p><ul><li>Tax policy is automated. The central bank&rsquo;s computer decides you owe taxes, and those funds instantly vanish from your account. With or <i>without</i> your consent!</li><li>Money is fully controlled by unelected bureaucrats. Not just monetary policy, but money itself &mdash; who has access to it and how much &mdash; is determined not by politicians answerable to voters, but by unelected central bank officials.</li></ul><p>Consider this: Under a CBDC regime, debates like the one in Washington over whether to provide more post-election pandemic relief could become irrelevant.</p><p>Why? Because having direct access to the accounts of every citizen would effectively put the Federal Reserve &mdash; not Congress &mdash; in charge of US fiscal policy.</p><p>And mark our words, a lot of politicians would be OK with this. Because they would much rather have voters get mad at the Fed (instead of them) when onerous and unwelcomed taxes inevitably come due.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="cbdcs-are-more-efficient---much-like-monarchies-are-more-efficient-than-democracies">CBDCs are more &lsquo;efficient&rsquo; &mdash; much like monarchies are more &lsquo;efficient&rsquo; than democracies</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Under a monarchy, you can go from being a prince to a peasant merely by incurring the wrath of the king. In a CBDC world, similar patterns could emerge.</p><p>Offend the wrong person, and you find yourself destitute by decree &mdash; that is, denied all access to money &mdash; at the flick of a switch.</p><p>The choice could not be clearer. Do you want autocratic rule and top-down decision-making? Or freedom, democracy, and accountability on the part of the ruling class?</p><p>Little by little, abuse by abuse, people today are going to have to relearn an age-old lesson: Bad things happen when too few people have too much power.</p><p>If America&rsquo;s Founding Fathers were alive today, they would <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/us-founding-fathers-would-make-bitcoin-primary-legal-tender-7027.htm">undoubtedly champion Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/">other cryptoassets</a> &mdash; as a way to challenge the all-encompassing power of an unelected technocratic bureaucracy.</p><p>If you value your financial freedom going forward, cryptocurrencies might soon be your only choices.</p><p>But no matter what happens, the message is clear. BEWARE OF CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCIES.<br>

The American <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/knife-edge-biden-trump-showdown-has-crypto-backers-on-both-s-8213.htm">election</a> is over, if not yet finally decided. But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> barely seemed to notice. It finished Election Day pretty much where it began &mdash; with within a few percent of USD 13,500.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5fa/58b21c8d56.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5fa/58b21c8d56.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5fa/58b21c8d56.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5fa/58b21c8d56.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5fa/58b21c8d56.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5fa/58b21c8d56.jpg 1209w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Adobe/noskaphoto</figcaption></figure><p>That&rsquo;s because basic economic reality remains unchanged.</p><p>Flagrant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fiat-money-printer-goes-brrr-is-it-a-time-to-sell-cash-for-b-6063.htm">money-printing</a>, once begun, is a tough habit to break. And debt has become so astronomical in size, the merest whiff of higher interest expense threatens to push vast swaths of the economy into bankruptcy.</p><p>That virtually guarantees near-zero interest rates will continue indefinitely.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="this-reality-is-causing-a-broad-shift-in-sentiment-toward-crypto-assets">This reality is causing a broad shift in sentiment toward crypto assets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Just a couple years ago, for example, investment market sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish. Talking heads on Bloomberg and CNBC routinely labelled crypto &ldquo;the biggest bubble of all time.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/warren-buffett/">Warren Buffett</a> famously said bitcoin was &ldquo;rat poison squared.&rdquo;</li><li><b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/jpmorgan/">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</a></b> CEO Jamie Dimon declared bitcoin a &ldquo;fraud,&rdquo; saying: &#8220;If you&#8217;re stupid enough to buy it, you&#8217;ll pay the price for it one day.&#8221;</li></ul><p>Fast forward to the present, and how dramatically things have changed. Now, JPMorgan analysts <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/interest-in-bitcoin-spikes-as-paypal-jpmorgan-and-kanye-west-8113.htm">say</a> BTC has &ldquo;significant upside,&rdquo; as it competes with gold as an alternative reserve asset &mdash; especially among millennials. </p><p>Their conclusion: </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from here.&rdquo; </p></blockquote><p>Even more dramatically, payment services giant <b>PayPal</b> suddenly announced it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/paypal-ceo-financial-system-not-working-clients-very-eager-f-8188.htm">will offer bitcoin</a> (and other crypto assets) to its 346 million customers worldwide.</p><p>This move was likely accelerated by PayPal&rsquo;s much smaller rival, <b>Square</b>. Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s Square said its <b>Cash App</b> business raked in USD 1.63bn &ldquo;of bitcoin revenue,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;USD 32m of bitcoin gross profit&rdquo; in the third quarter of FY2020.</p><p>PayPal&rsquo;s move is a giant step toward mainstream adoption of BTC by ordinary people. Because now, for the first time, they will be able to directly pay for retail purchases using BTC in their PayPal wallet.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="more-than-a-safe-haven">More than a safe haven</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Beyond being a safe haven, BTC also has two other key qualities of paramount interest to investors.</p><ul><li><b>First</b>, it represents cutting-edge 21st century technology. </li><li><b>Second</b>, it&rsquo;s wildly undervalued. (The total value of all the bitcoin in the world is only a fraction of the market capitalization of gold. Or even a single big tech stock.)</li></ul><p>Cutting-edge tech at hugely under-valued prices &hellip; is one of the roadmaps to fortune in today&rsquo;s investment markets.</p><p>Imagine how rich you&rsquo;d be if you bought <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></b> when it was still run out of the Gates family garage. Or <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/facebook/">Facebook</a></b> when Mark Zuckerberg was still a college student.</p><p>Bitcoin represents a similarly epic investment opportunity.</p><p>On top of that, as investment market sentiment becomes more crypto-friendly, you&rsquo;re going to see a tsunami of money pouring out of government bonds and fiat currencies.</p><p>Where&rsquo;s it going to go? Into crypto assets like bitcoin and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, because they&rsquo;re beyond the ability of governments to corrupt.</p><p>This tsunami is going to hit the legacy financial system like a Category 5 hurricane, and catapult crypto prices to many multiples of where they trade today.<br>

Or the Senate. Or the US House of Representatives.</p><p>Why? Because both sides have sworn to print and spend trillions more in yet ANOTHER attempt to jump-start a sickly economy.</p><p>There comes a time in the life cycle of every empire &hellip; where common sense and reason give way to laziness and hubris. It&rsquo;s not as if we haven&rsquo;t seen reckless money printing before.</p><p>The Romans tried it a couple millennia ago, for instance. And all it did was accelerate the collapse.</p><p>Looking beyond the election, it&rsquo;s abundantly clear the unprecedented mismanagement of the US economy is <i>not</i> going to change. For example, all we hear out of Washington is &hellip;</p><ul><li>Deficits don&rsquo;t matter.</li><li>Spending money doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li><li>And printing reckless amounts of dollars doesn&rsquo;t bring about inflation.</li></ul><p>Gosh, if you believe this &hellip; I may have some swampland in Florida you&rsquo;d like to buy!</p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-eve-of-destruction">The eve of destruction</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Look, I&rsquo;m not saying flagrant money-printing is the single cause of all the world&rsquo;s ills. But it is undeniably a symptom of a financial system on the edge of collapse.</p><p>Innovation, investment and honest hard work, all fundamental American values, have given way to corruption, cronyism &mdash; and the printing press is being run to pay for it all.</p><p>That brings me to recent action taken by the US <b>Department of Justice</b> and <b>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</b>. They <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-arthur-hayes-steps-down-as-ceo-of-bitmex-7931.htm">charged <b>BitMEX</b></a> with illegally operating an unlicensed derivatives exchange and Violating the Bank Secrecy Act.</p><p>BitMEX founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/arthur-hayes/">Arthur Hayes</a> was born and raised in America. He practically invented the derivatives contracts that are now used to trade hundreds of billions of dollars every month.</p><p>This is American ingenuity at its finest.</p><p>How is he rewarded? By being labelled a criminal. And for what? Violating a law that&rsquo;s mostly used to protect big, politically well-connected banks from uncomfortable competition.</p><p>Why do I say this?</p><p>Because just as the U.S. government is trying to ruin BitMEX, we learn banking behemoth <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/jpmorgan/">JPMorgan</a></b> is quietly settling a lawsuit for knowingly manipulating precious metals markets, causing investors to lose USD 300m. No criminal charges whatsoever.</p><p>Gimme a break!</p><h2 data-param="1" id="deja-vu---all-over-again!">D&eacute;j&agrave; vu &mdash; all over again!</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Sounds like 2008, doesn&rsquo;t it? Tens of millions of Americans lost their homes. Dozens of banks knowingly and willingly defrauded investors. And yet no one was charged. Or went to jail.</p><p>No matter how bitterly contested, it&rsquo;s going to take a lot more than a Presidential election to truly solve any of this. And the crypto markets understand this. Perversely perhaps &hellip;</p><ul><li>The more chaotic the legacy legal and political systems of America become, the more crypto assets thrive.</li><li>The more US government officials crack down on crypto trading, the more they push innovation offshore &mdash; and make global competitors like China or Russia look good by comparison.</li><li>And the more they corrupt the currency, the more people all over the world pull funds out of the legacy fiat money system and into cryptocurrencies, driving them higher and higher.</li></ul><p>So, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going to be any kind of return to &ldquo;normal life&rdquo; after the election. Regardless of who wins, quiet times do <i>not</i> lie ahead. The revolution is about to erupt. And no power on earth can stop it.<br>

And they&rsquo;re voting with their money.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="big-foot-investors-warming-up-to-bitcoin">Big-foot investors warming up to Bitcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Here are some highlights:</p><ul><li>Physically-settled <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC</a> tech/Adoption Grade &ldquo;A-&rdquo;) futures &mdash; which permit institutional investors to take physical delivery of actual BTC &mdash; are surging in popularity. In January, physically-settled contracts accounted for less than half the bitcoin futures trading on the <b>Intercontinental Exchange</b>. Now, it&rsquo;s 72% and climbing.</li><li>Legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/paul-tudor-jones-confirms-his-fund-allocated-hundreds-of-mil-6519.htm">said</a> his flagship fund will buy bitcoin.</li><li><b>Grayscale Investments</b>, sponsor of America&rsquo;s first bitcoin stock fund, Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC), scooped up 17,100 more BTC the week ending Sept. 29. That brings total holdings to a whopping 449,800 BTC. That&rsquo;s 2.4% of bitcoin&rsquo;s total circulating supply!</li><li>Enterprise software house <b>MicroStrategy</b> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategy-ceo-on-buying-bitcoin-while-trillions-melting-7738.htm">announced</a> it would move the bulk of its cash position (some USD 500 million) to bitcoin. In doing so, CEO Michael Saylor put forth two compelling reasons to load up on Bitcoin:</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>Forget consumer-price inflation, it&rsquo;s asset price inflation you should worry about &mdash; which is running 6% to 15% a year. That&rsquo;s also about how fast real estate, college costs and stock prices are going up. Put money in a bank? You may as well set it on fire!</li><li>Of all safe-haven assets, bitcoin is the best by far. Gold is already near all-time highs. Buy it here, and maybe you double your money (over many years). But bitcoin&rsquo;s market cap is only about 1/50th the size of precious metals as an asset class. That&rsquo;s enough room for several thousand percent gains as it catches up with gold.</li></ol><p>And as professional money-managers warm up to crypto, beware of an impending avalanche effect. As bitcoin attracts more and more institutional money, other fund managers are going to be forced to buy it. Because none of them can afford to underperform their peers by not having bitcoin in their portfolios.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="money-like-a-melting-ice-cube">Money like a melting ice cube</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>We live in world where the purchasing power of money is being drained away by central banks at breakneck speed. This naturally lifts the prices of everything, including investment assets, and especially safe havens like bitcoin.</p><p>But beyond its safe-haven <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-is-the-strongest-validation-of-the-bitcoin-safe-haven-t-5529.htm">appeal</a>, bitcoin also represents an emerging technology &mdash; that most investors around the world don&rsquo;t understand and are therefore still skeptical about.</p><p>But as cryptocurrencies go mainstream over the next decade, they&rsquo;re going to make millions of otherwise ordinary investors who buy crypto now vastly rich. You and I may as well be among them!</p><p>Money melting like an ice cube has changed the nature of investing. With the prices of all assets going up, winning investing boils down to zeroing in on those that go up fastest.</p><p>And in this respect, no other asset class can hold a candle to cryptocurrencies going forward. Top-rated Weiss cryptos are the cream of the crop. They can multiply your money 5-fold, 15-fold, even 100-fold in less than a decade.</p><p>The choice, as they say, is yours.</p>

Not only are reckless money-printing schemes ineffective at creating economic prosperity, the only thing they do cause in the long run is widespread asset-price inflation, increasing economic inequality along the way.</p><p>This is as true now as it&rsquo;s been throughout history.</p><p>The political tensions caused by the reckless mismanagement of the economy can be felt the world over, and neither of the men vying for the White House, or the political parties they represent, have any hope &mdash; or intention &mdash; of stopping these long-term trends.</p><p>Crypto is a shelter &mdash; perhaps the only viable one &mdash; against the monetary insanity that&rsquo;s taken over the world&rsquo;s most developed economies.</p><p>At the same time, the CFTC and the Department of Justice going after BitMEX &mdash; the oldest crypto derivatives exchange &mdash; is also a non-event. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cftc-investigation-targets-bitmex-4277.htm">It&rsquo;s been known</a> among market participants that BitMEX has been in the crosshairs of US regulators since at least 2019.</p><p>Most derivatives exchanges know better than to serve US customers. And virtually all of them have strict &ldquo;know your customer&rdquo; requirements to enforce these policies.</p><p>From a big-picture perspective, this is damaging for the US-based crypto industry only.</p><p>And all it accomplishes is to reinforce yet another trend that has also long been in motion: The crypto industry is unable to thrive in the US and most developers and talent are moving offshore to build their products.</p><p>It&rsquo;s precisely because these two developments only reinforce what we already know to be true: Crypto assets have remained unfazed in the face of what, on the surface, seem like &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; events.</p>

Indeed, he&rsquo;s the co-founder and former CEO of <b>AngelList</b>.</p><p>And he&rsquo;s provided early-stage capital for more than 200 companies, including <b>Uber Technologies, Inc.</b> (NYSE: UBER, Rated &ldquo;D&rdquo;) and, yes, <b>Twitter, Inc.</b> (NYSE: TWTR, Rated &ldquo;D+&rdquo;). The latter are just two of the 10 &ldquo;unicorns&rdquo; he&rsquo;s helped launch.</p><p>So, it&rsquo;s significant when he tweets stuff like this:</p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1304963641100259328"></oembed></div><p>We wrote about DeFi &ndash; that&rsquo;s short for &ldquo;decentralized finance&rdquo; &ndash; in the August issue of Weiss Crypto Investor:</p><p><i>DeFi is essentially borrowing, lending and trading financial assets on the blockchain. The key difference is there&rsquo;s no traditional intermediary &mdash; bank, broker or stock exchange &mdash; standing in the middle and taking a slice of every transaction.</i></p><p><i>DeFi is growing like crazy because such services cost far less and require far less time than the same services from legacy providers &#8230; like brick-and-mortar banks and human brokers.</i></p><p><i>DeFi usage is going ballistic.</i></p><figure style="max-width: 524px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5f6/39ada0195e.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 524px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5f6/39ada0195e.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5f6/39ada0195e.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5f6/39ada0195e.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5f6/39ada0195e.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5f6/39ada0195e.png 524w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><i>This chart tracks the total dollar value of the assets (TVL) locked up inside various DeFi platforms to collateralize loans and leveraged trading.</i></p><p><i>Over just the last three months, TVL has surged from about USD 900 million to USD 4.4 billion.</i></p><div class="tweet tweetContainer"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1303363748120465408"></oembed></div><p>We&rsquo;d gone a little deeper about what happened two years ago in the August WCI:</p><p><i>This reminds us of a key antecedent to the epic bull market of 2017 &mdash; which took Bitcoin from USD 1,000 to USD 20,000. Back then, one of the big things investors first got excited about &mdash; and later, manic &mdash; was an unprecedented flood of initial coin offerings (ICOs).</i></p><p><i>All these projects were full of promises, but most never amounted to a hill of beans. A few delivered on their promises &#8230; only to discover they had built a super-highway no one wanted to drive on &mdash; to a destination no one wanted to visit.</i></p><p><i>In other words, they were projects with near zero real-world appeal, adoption and usage.</i></p><p><b><i>Could today&#8217;s DeFi boom ignite <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>&#8216;s next epic surge &mdash; like ICOs helped fuel the first?</i></b></p><p><i>Yes, it could. In fact, this is far from a crazy idea. For one thing, there&#8217;s a lot more substance to DeFi today than there ever was in the ICO bubble. No crypto ghost towns here, or highways to nowhere.</i></p><p><i>And, thanks to near-zero interest rates, investors are finding positive &mdash; sometimes even double-digit &mdash; yields offered by DeFi on crypto are practically impossible to pass up.</i></p><p><i>As a consequence, DeFi adoption and usage are surging. And these are two of the most important indicators of long-term success in the crypto world.</i></p><p><i>Beyond that, there&rsquo;s also a good chance the DeFi boom will open wide the floodgates for venture capital and hedge-fund money to pour into crypto.</i></p><p><i>If that happens, Bitcoin&#8217;s next epic bull run is going to make 2017 look like small potatoes, by comparison.</i></p><p>DeFi is coming for Wall Street &mdash; and all such old-school &ldquo;middlemen,&rdquo; for that matter.<br>

Apparently, it wasn&#8217;t enough for the <b>Federal Reserve</b> merely to skirt the law by pouring freshly printed money into junk bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>Now they intend to just scoop &#8217;em up by the wheel-barrow load &mdash; <i>directly</i>.</p><p>We are fast becoming a world where a fake USD 20 bill can get you killed. (Remember, the chain of events that led to the murder of George Floyd &mdash; and nation-wide riots &mdash; began when a convenience store clerk refused a suspicious USD 20 banknote he tried to buy cigarettes with.)</p><p>Yet, when 20 people meet behind closed doors in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s marble-columned building (in Foggy Bottom, Wash.) and dole out trillions of freshly printed dollars to politically well-connected companies &#8230; we call that &#8220;monetary policy.&#8221;</p><p><b>Words cannot describe how morally depraved this is.</b></p><p>As chaos and riots sweep across the nation, the Fed is pumping more and more freshly printed money into big, badly managed corporations. (It reminds us of Emperor Nero singing and playing his lyre while Rome burned to the ground around him!)</p><p>At last count, nearly 46 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in just three months. Tens of thousands of businesses closed their doors, many of them forever.</p><p>But if you&rsquo;re a giant corporation &#8230; with an army of lobbyists &#8230; you get all kinds of money thrown your way. The Fed says this must be done, because of a &ldquo;liquidity&rdquo; crisis.</p><p>Give me a break! Do words no longer have <i>any</i> meaning? What deadbeat company cannot claim to have a &ldquo;temporary liquidity crisis.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Not only is this monetary policy ridiculous &#8230; It&rsquo;s fundamentally UNFAIR.</b></p><p>In a truly free market, collective buying and selling decisions of the masses dictate which businesses thrive and which go under &mdash; not a bunch of unelected central bank bureaucrats.</p><p>Buying the debt of big, politically-connected companies (that would be insolvent if not for endless bailouts) does <i>not</i> create new jobs. Nor does it generate the billions in earnings lost to pandemic lockdowns.</p><p>All this does is create zombie companies and a permanent underclass &mdash; of folks the political bosses in Washington consider unworthy to feast at Fed&#8217;s trough of trillions.</p><p><b>Some say only gold can restore honest money. They&rsquo;re wrong!</b></p><p>We&#8217;ve been down this road before. A century ago, every paper dollar issued in the United States was redeemable on demand for gold (or silver). But the politicians eventually found a way to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoiners-ask-wtf-happened-in-1971-the-answer-might-shape-t-6827.htm">scrap the gold standard</a>.</p><p>And if they did it once, they can surely do it again. That leaves cryptocurrencies as the only honest alternative to the morally bankrupt monetary system we have today.</p><p>And that&#8217;s because cryptoassets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> aren&rsquo;t centrally controlled.</p><p>You may have heard it said that &ldquo;miners&rdquo; mint new supplies of Bitcoin. But miners are by and large just regular people like you and me. </p><p>Bitcoin miners <i>don&#8217;t set</i> monetary policy. That&#8217;s up to the ENTIRE community of people who use Bitcoin.</p><p>This is why it&#8217;s so <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/attempts-to-increase-bitcoin-s-supply-would-end-up-with-anot-6030.htm">damn hard to change</a> even the tiniest detail of how Bitcoin operates. The overwhelming majority of users <i>must</i> agree. Or nothing happens.</p><p>Compare that to how we set monetary policy. Would an overwhelming majority of US dollar users have agreed to the Fed bailing out failing companies in 2008 &mdash; while letting millions of homeowners get foreclosed on?</p><p>Would they have voted to pour trillions into big, badly run companies &mdash; while 47 million ordinary Americans, who lost their jobs to pandemic panic, got left holding the bag?</p><p>Hell no!</p><p><b>Sadly, nothing about our monetary system reflects the will of the majority. Or even benefits the majority, in the long run.</b></p><p>This is exactly the problem that true cryptocurrencies like BTC, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">cardano (ADA)</a> resolve. Because they bring democracy to money.</p><p>This is key, because it&#8217;s the utter <i>absence</i> of democracy in the monetary system that ultimately does the most damage to Western economies.</p><p>The Framers of the American Constitution wrote:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;No state shall &#8230; coin money, emit bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts &#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>They did not write this because they were gold bugs. Or lovers of precious metals. It&#8217;s just that they had no rose-colored illusions about human nature.</p><p>They understood giving any person or group central control over money would eventually doom the Republic. And back then, gold and silver were the only non-centrally controlled money available.</p><p>But what if America&#8217;s constitutional convention were held today? It&rsquo;s very likely that the Founding Fathers would also make bitcoin &mdash; and perhaps a few other cryptos &mdash; primary legal tender.</p><p>This is why bitcoin (and other cryptoassets) are going to be the future of money. Central banks are now destroying the world&#8217;s major paper currencies &mdash; and no power on earth can stop them.</p><p>And to make big money as an investor, you absolutely have to be on the right side of history.</p>

__________</p><p>As pandemic panic crushes the life out of the global economy, central banks are pouring trillions of dollars into the global money supply.</p><p>And America&#8217;s <b>Federal Reserve</b> is leading the way.</p><p>It&#8217;s printing money at such a furious pace, it makes the huge rescue following the failure of <b>Lehman Brothers</b> in 2008 look like pale, stale, ale by comparison.</p><p>Naturally, wholesale debasement of fiat currencies worldwide is starting to fuel near-insatiable demand for assets beyond the reach of bureaucrats, politicians and governments to corrupt.</p><p>For centuries, gold has been investors&#8217; first choice in this regard. But thanks to the blockchain revolution, we now have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC, Tech/Adoption Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo;) &mdash; which is giving gold a run for its money.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5eb/573c4b6834.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5eb/573c4b6834.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5eb/573c4b6834.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5eb/573c4b6834.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5eb/573c4b6834.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5eb/573c4b6834.jpg 837w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><b>Bitcoin offers as tough a defense as gold against government manipulation and control.</b></p><p>But in other key respects, it has advantages gold cannot possibly match. For example:</p><p><b>Confiscation Resistant</b>. Government bureaucrats cannot inflate away the purchasing power of your gold like they can with fiat currency. But they <i>can</i> send their storm-troopers stomping in to seize it.</p><ul><li>In 1933, a US President famously confiscated all the gold in America.</li><li>Australia&#8217;s 1959 Banking Act empowered the government to force private citizens to turn in their gold for paper currency.</li><li>In 1966, Britain&#8217;s Labor government made it illegal for any person to own more than four precious metal coins.</li></ul><p>Don&#8217;t think stuff like this can&#8217;t still happen.

And now &#8230;</p><p><b>As the full extent economic devastation wrought by pandemic lockdowns becomes undeniable &#8230; a lot of chickens are going to come home to roost.</b></p><p>Already, Argentina is on the brink of its ninth sovereign default. The ruling mullahs in Teheran are about to knock four zeros off their nearly worthless paper currency (USD 1=42,105 Iranian rials) and re-issue it.</p><p>As a result, the possibility your gold may be stolen or confiscated is hardly abating. Quite the opposite. It&#8217;s fast approaching the danger zone. But <i>not</i> so with Bitcoin.</p><p>The <i>only</i> physical manifestations of your Bitcoin ownership are the character strings that comprise your wallet address and private key.</p><p>Never has a financial asset been more easily concealable &mdash; and therefore less confiscatable &mdash; than this.</p><p><b>Transport.</b> Gold is 70% heavier than lead. Plus, it requires guards with guns to protect it in transit. That costs money.</p><p>Also, bank vault services, armed guards, and armored transport services are usually heavily regulated businesses. That means you need at least <i>tacit</i> permission from the government to make any kind of a move.</p><p>What if you don&#8217;t have special permission from the government?</p><p>Just look at what happened to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-25/u-k-said-to-deny-maduro-s-bid-to-pull-1-2-billion-of-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuela</a> when it tried to access [USD] 1.2 billion of its own gold reserves from the Bank of England &mdash; where it was supposed to be held in safe custody!</p><p>By contrast, Bitcoin is weightless and travels over the Internet without anyone&#8217;s permission. <i>And</i> at near zero cost.</p><p><b>Holding Costs.</b> Gold requires a secure location. If you don&#8217;t have your own vault, you will have to rent one at a bank or other trusted institution. By contrast, Bitcoin costs <i>nothing</i> to store.</p><p>For all these reasons, we think it&#8217;s pretty clear &#8230;</p><h3 data-param="2" id="bitcoins-post-pandemic-upside-is-going-to-be-bigger-than-gold.">Bitcoin&#8217;s post-pandemic upside is going to be bigger than gold.</h3><p>Indeed, recent history bears this out. After world central banks went on their money-printing rampage in 2008 &hellip;</p><ul><li>Gold shot up roughly 200%, eventually topping out near [USD] 1,900 &mdash; which ain&#8217;t bad!</li><li>But Bitcoin blasted up about 1,000,000%, topping out near [USD] 20,000.</li></ul><p>To be clear, we&#8217;re <i>not</i> saying Bitcoin is going to go up <i>another</i> million percent from here (almost USD 10,000 today). But 3- or 4-fold gains are well within the realm of possibility. Already, since the mid-March flash-crash in the investment markets, Bitcoin has been outperforming gold 5-to-1.<br>

Flexible Governance</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Without good governance, decision-making goes into limbo. The community of participants, developers and sponsors can rupture and split. Two or more competing blockchains can emerge.</p><p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s exactly what once plagued Bitcoin, prompting <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash</a> to split off from the original Bitcoin. It&rsquo;s also what caused <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic</a> to break away from the original <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH</a>, Rated &ldquo;B+&rdquo;). It was tantamount to civil war.</p><p>But such as an outcome is extremely unlikely at Tezos, thanks to a governance structure that is both flexible and democratic at its core. Any token holder can propose an upgrade, which is then voted upon by other token holders. If enough vote in favor, or &ldquo;Yea&rdquo;, then the upgrade is implemented across the network.</p><p>Tezos has already done this twice, and token holders are voting on a third upgrade even as I write.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="2.-5%-crypto-dividends-paid-to-tezos-token-holders">2. 5% Crypto &lsquo;Dividends&rsquo; Paid to Tezos Token Holders</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Unlike first- or second-generation cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which use Proof of Work, Tezos, like most third-generation cryptocurrencies, uses Proof of Stake.</p><p>In both cases, participants validate transactions on the network and get rewarded with new tokens for doing so.</p><p>The difference is that with Proof of Work, they have to solve cryptographic puzzles, which can consume a tremendous amount of energy and require large warehouses full of expensive computer hardware to operate. With Proof of Stake, all they have to do is vote their tokens. The more tokens they hold, the more voting power they have.</p><p>And if you hold Tezos tokens, you have a choice:</p><ul><li>A. You can either participate directly and validate the transactions yourself. Or&#8230;</li><li>B. You can delegate your tokens to someone else who will validate the ledger and share the reward.</li></ul><p>The reason a token holder would delegate would be to pool resources with others. After all, to validate a transaction, you need to &ldquo;purchase a ticket&rdquo;. And as with any lottery, the more tickets you have, the greater your chances of winning.</p><p>So, unless you&rsquo;re a big player, it makes sense to pool resources. And you can do that by delegating your tokens.</p><p>This kind of token delegation is fast becoming a big business: Crypto exchange giants, such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Coinbase</b></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Binance</b></a>, run their own Tezos validators. They use tokens delegated to them by their customers. Then they share the rewards, like a dividend.</p><p>As I write, delegating your XTZ tokens to Coinbase nets you a 5% annual return.</p><p>That&#8217;s about five times more than what you can get on an average U.S. money market account or money market fund.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="3.-decentralization">3. Decentralization</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Generally speaking, the broader the participation in the validation process, the more decentralized and secure a crypto network is going to be.</p><p>With a Proof-of-Stake crypto, one of the keys to success is to get at least two-thirds of the tokens actively engaged in validating the blockchain.</p><p>So, in this respect, the 80% participation that Tezos has achieved is stellar. Heck, even <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/eos/">EOS (EOS</a>, Rated &ldquo;C&rdquo;), which has done pretty well in this regard, barely makes it to 50%.</p><p>Not only is the participation high, the number of validators on the Tezos network (which Tezos calls &#8220;bakers&#8221;) is well-distributed: The biggest Tezos &ldquo;baker&rdquo; controls only 6.57% of the token supply, and the second biggest controls just 4.30%.</p><p>Compare that to Bitcoin, where the largest miner controls 18.2% of mining capacity&hellip; or to EOS, where top validators control about <i>one third</i> of all the EOS tokens.</p><p>This means that Tezos stands alone as the most decentralized Proof-of-Stake crypto on the planet. By far. It is one of the key factors why Tezos has become so successful as a smart-contract platform in less than two years of operation.</p><p>These strengths all add up to give Tezos a Weiss Crypto Rating of &ldquo;B-&rdquo;. It still has a few shortcomings, like its slow processing speed. But last week, these strengths helped push Tezos ahead of the altcoin pack and lead the run to new bull-market highs.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on its progress.</p>

It&rsquo;s a platform for running an infinite variety of applications, called &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; or &ldquo;distributed applications&rdquo; (dapps).  </p><p>In fact, Ethereum aspires to be a worldwide computer capable of doing anything that a single, standalone computer can do, with two key differences:  It&rsquo;s everywhere, distributed all across the internet.  And nobody owns it.</p><p>That was the Ethereum dream. But then began the Ethereum nightmare &mdash; a traffic jam of epic dimensions.</p><p>You see, due to Ethereum&rsquo;s low capacity and slow speed &mdash; plus huge demand &mdash; the door was flung wide open to a host of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/wannabe-killers-keep-coming-for-ethereum-how-might-it-end-4922.htm">wannabe Ethereum killers</a>, all aspiring to replace it and become the new smart contract queen.  </p><p>And now the big news&hellip;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-king-of-crypto-itself-could-become-a-smart-contract-platform">The king of crypto itself could become a smart contract platform</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>I&rsquo;m talking about Bitcoin.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m referring to a new generation of Bitcoin developers that have appeared on the scene.</p><p>They&rsquo;re hell-bent on harnessing Bitcoin&#8217;s first-mover advantage to muscle in on Ethereum&#8217;s smart contract turf.</p><p>Their project is RSK <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/rootstock/">(RBTC)</a>, and it has all the earmarks of becoming one of the toughest combatants in the smart contract war.</p><p>To be clear, RSK isn&rsquo;t a run-of-the-mill upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>It&#8217;s a whole <i>new</i> blockchain, designed as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-are-sidechains-2658.htm">sidechain</a> that&rsquo;s entirely dedicated to running smart contracts.</p><p>Think of a major highway strictly for moving (or storing) money. That&rsquo;s Bitcoin.</p><p>Then think of a parallel superhighway for doing everything else. That&rsquo;s RSK.</p><p>What about the miners? They&rsquo;re the same as the Bitcoin miners. Plus, of course, it&rsquo;s open to anyone with Internet access and a regular computer.</p><p>The major difference:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin miners earn block rewards paid in newly-created Bitcoin (BTC).</li><li>RSK miners earn block rewards from fees earned from by RSK smart contract users. And they&rsquo;re paid in RSK Bitcoins (RBTC).</li><li>A key reason it works: The RBTC and BTC are freely exchangeable one-to-one, anytime. In effect, RBTC is simply a form of Bitcoin used for running smart contracts.</li></ul><p>Now, with this revolutionary change&hellip;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoin-owners-can-run-dapps">Bitcoin owners can run dapps</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re among the millions who own Bitcoin.</p><p>Until now, all you could do is transfer it, spend it or hoard it.</p><p>But with the advent of RSK, all that changes. For the first time since Bitcoin was born, you can run Distributed Applications.</p><p>Or, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a Bitcoin developer. Without RSK, the things you could do were very narrowly confined. Now, you can use Bitcoin to build a myriad of applications.</p><p>Given the sheer size and volume of the Bitcoin network, we have little doubt RSK is going to be a hit.</p><p>And Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>) developers could be among the first to switch.</p><p>Why switch?</p><p><b>First</b>, because RSK and Ethereum code have a lot in common. Some might say they&rsquo;re virtually the same. So with RSK, anything currently running on Ethereum should run equally well on Bitcoin. It&rsquo;s a relatively easy move.</p><p><b>Second</b>, because of the collateral. Right now, DeFi apps that run on Ethereum use ETH for collateral. If they switch to Bitcoin, they will use BTC. Given the security, stability and size of Bitcoin, that&rsquo;s a big advantage.</p><p>Right now, for example, a major Ethereum-project is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dai/">DAI</a>, a stablecoin with the potential to disrupt the way money works. DAI is currently backed by ETH, which most people know much less about. Imagine if it&rsquo;s backed by the widely known (and owned) Bitcoin instead!</p><p>And think about what Bitcoin RSK could do for a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platforms. If they switch to Bitcoin, they have the potential to gain almost instant credibility, greatly enhancing their chances for success.</p><p>End result. Someday, Bitcoin could emerge from its current, limited-use cases (mostly a store of value), and become the fuel for running smart contracts in what&rsquo;s bound to become a fuel-thirsty market.</p>

__________</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has busted through the USD 9,000 barrier and is now holding firmly above the USD 8,500 level.</p><p>The timing fits neatly with what our cycle model tells us for this crypto bull market. And it&rsquo;s still got far to go before the cycle ends.</p><p>The big remaining question is: HOW far?</p><p>Cycles don&rsquo;t give you the most accurate answers to that question &ndash; they&rsquo;re much better at telling you WHEN a market is ripe for the next move. So today we present a totally different kind of analysis. We start by asking this simple question:</p><h2 data-param="1" id="are-bitcoin-buyers-in-the-red-or-black?">Are Bitcoin buyers in the red or black?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>An impossible question to answer? Quite to the contrary, it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy. Consider this hypothetical scenario&hellip;</p><ul><li>Current Bitcoin market price &mdash; USD 10,000 per BTC.</li><li>Total supply of Bitcoin &mdash; just two coins. Let&rsquo;s call them &ldquo;BTC #1&rdquo; and &ldquo;BTC #2.&rdquo; (That&rsquo;s it. In this scenario, there are no other Bitcoins in existence.)</li><li>BTC #1 just changed hands seconds ago for USD 10,000.</li><li>BTC #2 last changed hands months ago for USD 5,000.</li></ul><p>So, <b>that means</b>&hellip;</p><ul><li>Their total value is USD 20,000. (That&rsquo;s the total <b>Market Cap</b>.)</li><li>Their owners paid USD 15,000 for them. (That&rsquo;s called <b>Realized Market Cap</b>.)</li><li>The total net gain: USD 5,000.</li></ul><p><b><i>And it&rsquo;s this gain or loss that helps tell us how big the next big move in Bitcoin is likely to be.</i></b></p><p>Each chart below shows the two measures we just told you about.</p><p>The red line is Bitcoin&rsquo;s Market Cap &mdash; how much all the Bitcoins are worth.</p><p>The pink area is Bitcoin&rsquo;s Realized Market Cap &mdash; how much Bitcoin owners paid for them.</p><p>And what we want you to pay close attention to is the <i>difference</i> between the two &mdash; the overall net open gain or loss.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the key&hellip;</p><ul><li>When Bitcoin owners have large open gains, Bitcoin is overvalued&hellip;</li><li>When they have only tiny open gains, Bitcoin is undervalued, and&hellip;</li><li>When they have outright open losses, Bitcoin is <i>grossly</i></li></ul><p>Now, let&rsquo;s move through time, step by step &hellip;</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoin-from-july-2013---october-2016">Bitcoin from July 2013 &ndash; October 2016</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure style="max-width: 620px"><a href="https://www.weissinc.com/media/images/newsletters/2020/WCY011620_2.jpg" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e2/b12e3038a2.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 620px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e2/b12e3038a2.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5e2/b12e3038a2.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5e2/b12e3038a2.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5e2/b12e3038a2.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>Figure 1: The red line is the July 2013 to October 2016 time series for Bitcoin&#8217;s Market Cap.

We start in July of 2013.</b> It&rsquo;s just before a major bull market really gets under way. The Realized Market Cap (pink area is just a hair below the Market Cap (red line). Bitcoin is undervalued.</p><p><b>2. November 2013.</b> Bitcoin takes off like a rocket, and by the end of the month, its Market Cap is far above its Realized Market Cap. That means Bitcoin owners now sit on monster unrealized gains and Bitcoin is overvalued.</p><p>Result: As December begins, Bitcoin owners rush to cash in. In less than three weeks, the price of Bitcoin is literally crushed &mdash; by more than half.</p><p><b>3. January 2015 and beyond.</b> After a drawn out, one-year-plus bear market, a fundamental change creeps into the market: The Realized Market Cap is now significantly <b><i>higher</i></b> than the Market Cap. In other words, for the first time in many years, Bitcoin owners sit on big open losses.</p><p>Bitcoin is <i>grossly</i> undervalued. And a major bull market gets under way.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="bitcoin-from-july-2017---present">Bitcoin from July 2017 &ndash; Present</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure style="max-width: 591px"><a href="https://www.weissinc.com/media/images/newsletters/2020/WCY011620_3.jpg" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e2/b12ff218f3.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 591px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e2/b12ff218f3.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5e2/b12ff218f3.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5e2/b12ff218f3.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5e2/b12ff218f3.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"></a><figcaption>Figure 2: The red line is the July 2017 to January 2020 time series for Bitcoin&#8217;s Market Cap.

Again, we start in July, but this time in 2017.</b> That&rsquo;s exactly four years after our starting point in the prior cycle. A coincidence? No. In fact, four years is the same exact time frame of each Bitcoin halving cycle.</p><p>Again, precisely as in 2013, it&rsquo;s just before a major bull market gets under way.</p><p>Again, the Realized Market Cap (pink area) is just a hair lower than the Market Cap (red line).</p><p>And again, Bitcoin is undervalued.</p><p><b>2. November &ndash; December 2017.</b> Just as it did four years earlier, Bitcoin rockets higher in November. In six weeks, its Market Cap is far above its Realized Market Cap. Bitcoin is overvalued.</p><p>Result: Within days it plunges, as Bitcoin owners rush to cash in. In just seven weeks, Bitcoin&rsquo;s market cap is <i>crushed</i> again &mdash; this time by more than 60%.</p><p><b>3. November 2018 and beyond.</b> After a drawn out, one-year-plus bear market, that same fundamental change of four years ago returns to haunt the Bitcoin owners.</p><p>In other words, for the first time in four years, Bitcoin owners sit on big open losses, and Bitcoin is grossly undervalued.</p><p><b>4. July 2019.</b> Nearly in perfect cyclical harmony with the four-year-earlier cycle, a new Bitcoin bull market is under way.</p><p><b><i>This brings us to the present, with the next Bitcoin halving approaching and another surge in Bitcoin under way even as we speak.</i></b></p><p>What is the Realized Capital Gain indicator telling us now?</p><p>Well, to make it clear as day, let&rsquo;s translate the Realized Market Cap it into <b><i>average price</i></b> that current Bitcoin owners paid for their BTC &mdash; <b>USD 5,600</b>!</p><p>With Bitcoin now trading between USD 8,000 and USD 9,000, that means they&rsquo;re sitting on open gains.</p><p>But those open gains are still small. And if history is any guide, you won&rsquo;t see another major decline until the Market Cap is about <b><i>four times</i></b> higher than the Realized Market Cap.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t predict what the Realized Market Cap will be at that time. But even it stays the same as it is today, we&rsquo;d be looking at about USD 21,000 BTC at that time.</p><p>And if Realized Market Cap itself rises, as it invariably does in a major bull market, the price of BTC would have to be far higher.<br>

We dissect them. We run them through our technology model. And we give you our objective analysis. Period.</p><p>But this is an exception. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/will-ethereum-reach-serenity-this-year-5508.htm">Ethereum 2.0</a> is now finally moving forward in a substantive way, and it&rsquo;s slated to have far-reaching consequences &mdash; not just for Ether itself, but for virtually the entire crypto space.</p><p><b>Reason:</b> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> remains, far and away, the world&rsquo;s most popular smart-contract platform.</p><p>It&rsquo;s where thousands of projects reside. And it&rsquo;s the platform where folks all over the world are scrambling to build the virtual economy of the future.</p><p>The Ethereum network is so popular, in fact, that it&rsquo;s routinely overloaded. Transaction times become agonizingly slow. Transaction fees become exorbitantly expensive. And it&rsquo;s mostly been this way since 2017 &mdash; a chronic ailment that challenges the best minds.</p><p>Bad news? Not entirely. Developers and sponsors of other, competing smart-contract platforms often wish they could have the same &ldquo;disease.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Chronic congestion on the Ethereum network signals vast and growing worldwide adoption, arguably the single most important factor in the long-term success of any cryptocurrency.</b></p><p>But the big disparity we see between popularity and practicality cannot last forever. Ethereum users can only put up with annoying network congestion for so long before they start looking for alternatives.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what has given rise to the likes of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano (ADA)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/eos/">EOS (EOS)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tezos/">Tezos (XTZ)</a>, and others, all promising to be &ldquo;new and improved versions of Ethereum.&rdquo;</p><p>Would any of them make sense if Ethereum was already the fastest and cheapest smart contract platform on the planet? Probably not.</p><p>This is one reason why Ethereum 2.0 is such a big deal. If it works, it could seriously throw into question the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/wannabe-killers-keep-coming-for-ethereum-how-might-it-end-4922.htm">wannabe Ethereum killers</a> that have staked their futures on knocking the world&rsquo;s No. 1 smart-contact crypto off its perch.</p><p>Why? Because according to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, when Version 2.0 is fully implemented, the time required to confirm a transaction will drop from minutes to a meager three to six seconds &mdash; about as long as it takes to swipe a credit card.</p><p>Two major upgrades in the Ethereum code would make this possible.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-first-ethereum-upgrade-is-sharding">The first Ethereum upgrade is sharding</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Remember: A blockchain is a database. And as the name implies, the databased is made up of a chain of blocks. Each block records a batch of transactions. And each block is linked to the next block in the chain in chronological order.</p><p>The problem: If there&rsquo;s just one single blockchain on which ALL transactions must be recorded, it can create a massive traffic jam.</p><p>Imagine a single-lane superhighway with new traffic trying to ramp in from all sides. One obvious way of solving the problem: Build more lanes. In other words, run a bunch of parallel blockchains at the same time. Each shares its work across the group.</p><p>Easy to say. Not so easy to do. And Ethereum is not the only one dealing with this issue. Other crypto projects have also been looking for solutions along these lines. They have the main blockchain. Then, they create a series of sidechains to share the workload. Think of it as the main highway flanked by side roads.</p><p>Can this boost speed? Sure. But it&rsquo;s still a fundamentally flawed design because the sidechains all have fed into the main blockchain, which effectively creates <i>a new</i> bottleneck. What&rsquo;s worse, each sidechain has its own tokens, rules, and validators. So, things can get too darn complicated.</p><p>Ethereum 2.0 does things differently; it uses a process called &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/blockchains-are-learning-how-to-scale-but-at-what-price-1492.htm">sharding</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>Forget the superhighways and the side roads for a moment. Instead, walk over to a giant, disorganized library &mdash; so big and disorganized that it could take you years to find a single book. One possible solution: Assign each floor of the library to a single broad topic. Assign each row of bookcases to a subtopic. And then line all the books up alphabetically by author.</p><p>This is akin to sharding in the world of databases, with each shard representing one piece that&rsquo;s ultimately interconnected with every other piece. And it&rsquo;s not entirely new: Sharding is already a technique that tech giants routinely use to expand their massive databases.</p><p>Until now, only a few crypto development teams &mdash; Cardano, Hashgraph and now, Ethereum &mdash; have even figured out how this might be done <i>in theory</i>. None of them has actually implemented it in the real world.</p><p>The big news: <i>Ethereum 2.0 may soon become the very first to do so.</i></p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-second-ethereum-upgrade-is-proof-of-stake">The second Ethereum upgrade is Proof of Stake</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>One of the key reasons Ethereum has not been able to scale up to meet booming demand was that it essentially copied Bitcoin&rsquo;s Proof-of-Work approach.</p><p>With Proof of Work, miners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. Then the winner gets to write a new block of transactions to the blockchain and claim the reward for doing so. This mining requires faster and faster computers, consumes massive amounts of electricity and &#8230; takes TIME!</p><p>But in Version 2.0, Ethereum is slated to switch from the sluggish Proof-of-Work method to a much faster and efficient Proof-of-Stake approach.</p><p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a lottery system. If you&rsquo;re participating on Ethereum 2.0, each token you hold (ETH) resembles a lottery ticket. The more tokens you have, the better your chances of being chosen to write a new block to the blockchain and claim the reward.</p><p>Again, this is nothing new. Second- and third-generation blockchains already use Proof of Stake and do so pretty successfully. But Ethereum 2.0 adds some valuable new wrinkles.</p><p>All very exciting! But don&rsquo;t expect instant gratification. Upgrading a public open blockchain &mdash; especially one as popular as Ethereum &mdash; is an epic undertaking, akin to overhauling motorcycle engines while careening down the highway.</p><p>In fact, it&rsquo;s so difficult that legions of skeptics have famously doubted Ethereum 2.0 could ever be implemented. Now, however &#8230;</p><p><b>Ethereum developers have finally revealed their roadmap to Version 2.0, and it&rsquo;s remarkably elegant in its simplicity.</b></p><p>The main idea: The existing Ethereum network won&rsquo;t actually be upgraded at all. Instead, Ethereum 1.0 will continue as before. And developers will release the first iteration of Version 2.0 right alongside it.</p><p>None of the current Ethereum users will get a black eye if they decide not to switch. Meanwhile, as the overhauls are implemented and refined, the original Ethereum will be gradually phased out.</p>

&bull; In July 2016, it was halved again &mdash; to 12.50 BTC.<br>
&bull; And starting this coming May, it will drop to 6.25 BTC.</p><p>This is the &ldquo;halving&rdquo; of Bitcoin. And as you can see, it happens approximately every four years.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the key: <b>In both historical cases, the halving occurred just as Bitcoin was recovering from a prior bear market.</b></p><p>&bull; The 2012 Bitcoin halving followed a prior bear-market low (November 2011) by <b>12 months</b>;<br>
&bull; The 2016 halving Bitcoin followed the prior bear market&#8217;s double-bottom (January and August 2015) by <b>19 months</b> and <b>11 months</b>, respectively; and<br>
&bull; The upcoming halving is due 18 months after Bitcoin&#8217;s December 2018 bear-market low.</p><p>Given our in-depth study of Bitcoin cycles, this aspect merits a closer look. Broadly speaking &hellip;</p><p><b>After the first major leg up of a new bull market, Bitcoin often drifts into a relatively sleepy, sometimes months-long interval of sideways trading. Then comes a halving event &mdash; after which, the bull market really catches fire.</b></p><p>Now, let&#8217;s take a look at how the price action surrounding Bitcoin&#8217;s historical halving events traces this pattern.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-bitcoin-halving-of-2012">The Bitcoin halving of 2012</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Here&rsquo;s exactly what happened in the 12-month period prior to the halving &hellip;</p><p>&bull; In the first four months of that 12-month period, Bitcoin climbed a robust 1.29% per day (on average), as it rebounded from its prior bear-market low.<br>
&bull; However, in the eight months immediately prior to the halving, Bitcoin fell into a sideways trading range, during which it managed to climb by an average of just 0.62% a day.</p><p>Then, AFTER the halving, Bitcoin shot up a whopping 23% a day (on average) &mdash; until it finally reached its bull-market high.</p><p><b>Bitcoin Takes off Like a Rocket After Halving of 2012</b></p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e1/8abaa24ca7.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e1/8abaa24ca7.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5e1/8abaa24ca7.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5e1/8abaa24ca7.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5e1/8abaa24ca7.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5e1/8abaa24ca7.jpg 1821w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In the chart above, reading from left to right &hellip;</p><p>1. The first blue arrow points to Bitcoin&#8217;s initial leg up, as it rebounded from its previous bear-market low.</p><p>2. The shaded rectangle points to the sleepy, pre-halving consolidation period that followed.</p><p>3. After that period, the next blue arrow points to a spirited rally in anticipation of the halving, followed by a brief return to sideways trading.</p><p>4. Finally, as you can see in the chart, it&rsquo;s only after halving that the 2012 bull market really blasts off.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="the-bitcoin-halving-of-2016">The Bitcoin halving of 2016</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Here&rsquo;s what happened in the 12-month period prior to the 2016 halving. As you will see, the pattern mimics the 2012 experience.</p><p>&bull; In the first four months of that 12-month period, Bitcoin climbed by an average 0.84% per day, as it emerged from its prior bear-market low.<br>
&bull; Then, in the eight months immediately prior to the halving, Bitcoin again fell into a sideways trading range, during which it managed to climb by an average of only 0.39% per day.</p><p>And AGAIN, after the halving, the Bitcoin bull market abruptly caught a second wind. Bitcoin powered up by an average of 5.41% per day.</p><p><b>Bitcoin surges to all-time highs after halving of 2016</b></p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e1/8abb5edf53.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5e1/8abb5edf53.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5e1/8abb5edf53.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5e1/8abb5edf53.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5e1/8abb5edf53.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5e1/8abb5edf53.jpg 1857w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This second chart illustrates how the pattern is similar in the second halving, which occurred in July 2016. Reading the chart from left to right &hellip;</p><p>1. The first blue arrow shows Bitcoin&#8217;s first major leg up, as it recovered from its previous bear-market low.</p><p>2. Again, the shaded rectangle demarcates the sleepy pre-halving consolidation period that ensued.</p><p>3. After that period, the next blue arrow points to a rally in anticipation of the event. In this case, the pre-halving rally is especially exuberant. So, it&rsquo;s followed by a setback.</p><p>4. But again, in the months that follow, Bitcoin explodes in price, ultimately reaching its all-time high in December 2017.</p><p>In both cases, a breakout into a new bull market is followed by a pre-halving consolidation. And in both cases, the post-halving portion of the bull market is the <i>strongest</i> of the entire cycle.</p><p>Now the big question is: Will this pattern repeat itself in 2020 and beyond? Will the halving coming this May mark the beginning of another spectacular rise in Bitcoin? And what would be the best strategy for profiting from that move?</p><p>Stay tuned for the answers. Before you invest, there are critical wrinkles and risks you will need to be aware of.</p><p>Always remember: Although the past pattern is clear, history has a sneaky habit of adding some new twists and turns.<br>

If you visit crypto websites or ask casual observers, you might come away thinking there are thousands of &#8220;cryptocurrencies&#8221; in the world.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5dd/c039d28ca0.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5dd/c039d28ca0.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5dd/c039d28ca0.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5dd/c039d28ca0.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5dd/c039d28ca0.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5dd/c039d28ca0.jpg 1256w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/Ekspansio</figcaption></figure><p>Big mistake!</p><p>Yes, they&#8217;re all digital assets. And yes, they look similar on the surface.</p><p>But less than one-tenth are true cryptocurrencies.</p><p>So, before you invest another penny, you need to understand not only the differences, but also a few of the nuances.</p><p>There are two basic kinds:</p><p><b>Digital assets of the first kind are what we consider true cryptocurrencies. We call them &#8220;coins.&#8221;</b></p><p>They include <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/eos/">EOS</a> and others &mdash; digital money, which could someday function like dollars, euros or yen, but with much more transparency, efficiency and monetary discipline.</p><p>Physically speaking, they&#8217;re just data saved on computer hard drives following rules defined by specialized software. But that, in itself, should not be particularly surprising. The same is true for the money in your bank account, brokerage account or whole life insurance policy.</p><p>What&#8217;s unique is that the data is not stored in a central location or owned by a single organization. It&#8217;s automatically replicated and stored on countless computers all over the internet in a way that&#8217;s virtually hack-free, accessible to everyone and, ideally, controlled by no one.</p><p>These coins live on what&#8217;s called &#8220;public blockchains,&#8221; or more broadly speaking &#8220;public distributed ledgers.&#8221; There are hundreds of them. And many are supported by serious teams of developers.</p><p><b>Digital assets of the second kind are not true cryptocurrencies. Many people call them &#8220;ICOs.&#8221; We call them &#8220;tokens.&#8221;</b></p><p>They have some of the same physical properties as the coins. But with a couple of exceptions, which we&#8217;ll get to in a moment, they&#8217;re little more than receipts for financial donations.</p><p>These tokens are touted like stocks that you buy in a company. But most are really like tokens that kids get at Chuck E. Cheese Pizza.</p><p>Still, in 2017 and 2018, issuers raised more funds with tokens than was raised by all venture capital firms globally, although this trend slowed down considerably in 2019.</p><p>There are thousands in existence, and the overwhelming majority are either failures or scams.</p><p><b>Don&#8217;t ignore the variations and exceptions!</b></p><p>No naming conventions in the world of cryptocurrencies can ever be as simple as analysts like us would like to make them seem. There are always twists, turns, variations and exceptions. Here are the main ones:</p><p><b>Centrally managed coins.</b> The best example is what&#8217;s happening in the banking industry.</p><p>Banks and other financial institutions are large, centrally controlled, highly regulated institutions. They are naturally uncomfortable &mdash; and arguably incompatible &mdash; with digital assets that are completely open to anyone and controlled by no one.</p><p>&#8220;How in the heck do we enter into a contract with no one?&#8221; they ask. &#8220;And who do we go to when there&#8217;s a glitch?&#8221;</p><p>The Ripple company is the leader in offering a hybrid solution for these institutions. Ripple&#8217;s coin, called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a>, is technologically similar to other coins. But it&#8217;s managed and maintained by the Ripple company. That not only offers banks the advantages of enhanced security, efficiency and speed, but it also gives them an organization they can deal with. Facebook&#8217;s Libra is another ledger that intends to work along similar lines.</p><p><b>Tokens to coins.</b> Among the thousands of tokens in the world today, most will always be tokens and nothing more. But there are special-purpose tokens that are very different: They&#8217;re earmarked to be exchanged for actual coins at a predetermined date in the near future.</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of how it works: EOS is an advanced coin that boasts faster speeds and better scalability than Ethereum. In June of 2017, its sponsors announced they were going to launch the coin in June of 2018. But they needed to raise funds to finance the development.</p><p>So, they held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for an EOS token on the Ethereum network and raised $4 billion. Then, when they launched EOS on its own &#8220;Mainnet,&#8221; they swapped the Ethereum-based tokens for EOS coins.</p><p>This raises the question: Was the Ethereum-based EOS a token or a coin? In our cryptocurrency ratings model, we treat it as a coin.</p><p><b>Security Tokens.</b> The biggest problem with ordinary tokens has now become blatantly obvious: Most investors thought they would get a chance to participate in the success of a company, like owning common stocks.</p><p>But too many were taken to the cleaners. They got no ownership shares, no dividends, and no right to protest mismanagement. Not even protection against outright theft.</p><p>Now, however, the industry has a very viable solution: They&#8217;re encoding into the software new features, including investor rights and protections. They&#8217;re registering the tokens as if they were securities. And they&#8217;re on their way to creating what could someday be digital common stocks.</p><p>So far, there are just a handful. But soon, they&#8217;re bound to become the norm, replacing tokens in most cases.</p><p>Whether project issuers choose to build investor protections and real functionality into their tokens, or whether they choose to register their digital assets as securities is immaterial.</p><p>The bottom line is tokens are slowly evolving to become more useful, and some are even starting to emerge as viable investments.</p>

And yes, we can start in Beijing.</p><p>Back in 2017, the Chinese authorities didn&rsquo;t pussyfoot around. They went straight for the jugular  &mdash; the cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>That made sense, or so they thought. Exchanges are formal companies that need to be compliant with the regulatory framework of the countries where they operate.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the big all-important factoid that Beijing seems to have missed: <i>For a population to adopt cryptocurrencies, they don&rsquo;t need exchanges.</i></p><p><b>Are exchanges convenient?</b> Yes.</p><p><b>A dire necessity?</b> No</p><p>In fact, as I&rsquo;ll explain in a moment, they are just one of the ways you can exchange your government-sponsored fiat money into cryptocurrency.</p><p>Then, once you&rsquo;ve completed that initial trade, you&rsquo;re up in crypto-space. You can teleport your money anywhere you want. Your transactions are almost entirely outside the regulatory reach of any country on Earth.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean cryptocurrencies live in a Martian No Man&rsquo;s Land. They do follow a set of bylaws. The difference is, they&rsquo;re not the edicts or directives by any central authority. Instead &hellip;</p><p><b>The only rules that apply to a public distributed ledger are the rules of consensus that exist within its network. Nothing else.</b></p><p>In the parlance of the U.S. <b>Securities and Exchange Commission</b> or <b>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</b>, you might say that cryptocurrency networks are intensely rigorous &mdash; but amorphous &mdash; <i>self-regulatory organizations.</i></p><p>So, what was the net effect of the so-called &ldquo;China ban&rdquo; on cryptocurrencies?</p><p>Beijing was unable to outlaw the possession of crypto assets; it&rsquo;s almost impossible to even track down who owns what where.</p><p>They understood this. So, they didn&rsquo;t even try.</p><p>Reason: By their very design, cryptocurrency networks are anonymous.</p><p>Or, they&rsquo;re at least <i>pseudonymous</i>. In other words, although each account and the amount held is public information, it&rsquo;s not possible to directly tie the ownership of these accounts to any one individual.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite the &ldquo;ban,&rdquo; China has turned bullish on blockchain.</p><p>Last week, President Xi Jinping <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-s-president-makes-major-push-for-blockchain-4937.htm">declared that China must &ldquo;seize the opportunity&rdquo;</a> created by blockchain, and that it will play &ldquo;an important role in the next round of technological innovation and industrial transformation.&rdquo; And this week, China&rsquo;s Communist Party is taking a series of steps to follow through.</p><p>It underscores the reality that Chinese citizens are still very active trading crypto assets, despite the fact that the &ldquo;ban&rdquo; has been in force for over two years.</p><p>This is not to say that banning exchanges has no effect whatsoever. Though said effect is limited.  If established exchanges are not available, people simply move to specialized social media sites and similar applications.</p><p>Consider websites like LocalBitcoins.com, a peer-to-peer trading marketplace, for example.</p><p>These sites provide a framework to &#8230;</p><ul><li>Agree on terms and &#8230;</li><li>Reduce the risk that either side will run off with the money.</li></ul><p>In areas where cryptocurrency trading is officially &ldquo;banned,&rdquo; these kinds of platforms merely transform into de-facto over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges.</p><p>To put it simply:</p><p><b>So far, the only significant effect of crypto bans has been to drive some traders to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/otc/">OTC</a> (over-the-counter) trading platforms.</b></p><p>And it&rsquo;s not just China. Similar crypto bans in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe have accomplished little beyond making these platforms that much more popular.</p><p>Can governments shut down these as well? That would very difficult.</p><p>The parties meet anywhere &mdash; at a caf&eacute;, outside a bank, on a park bench. They agree to the terms. The fiat portion of the trade is carried out. And once the buyer has transferred the fiat via bank transfer (or even in cash), the seller releases the crypto.</p><p>Plus, for additional safety, both the fiat and the crypto can be locked in an escrow account under a smart contract.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="where-crypto-trading-is-literally-on-the-street">Where crypto trading is literally on the street</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Does it work? Absolutely! I know because I&rsquo;ve personally done these over-the-counter trades.</p><p>My experience isn&rsquo;t from a place where crypto is banned, but rather with a government that&rsquo;s on the brink of default.</p><p>As the authorities struggle to make ends meet and keep the lights on, they resort to draconian measures.</p><p>That takes us to the next stop on our tour: Argentina, where the government has imposed a whopping 33% tax on international transactions.</p><p>Think about that. It means that every time you want to use the banking system to get your money out of the country, the government takes nearly a one-third cut.</p><p>Maybe you want to make an online purchase of an airline ticket from a foreign carrier.</p><p>Or perhaps you just want to buy the latest smartphone not yet offered in local stores.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. If the money leaves Argentina, you pay the tax.</p><p>Or, consider the plight of businesspeople &hellip;</p><p>My father, for example, does business with companies based in Argentina. Whenever he brings the money home, the one-third tax is the equivalent of a massive confiscation.</p><p>All with practically zero hope it will end anytime soon!</p><p>For him, the only chance to get his money out of the country is to get some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>So to give him a hand, I went to Argentina to see how hard it would be to locate someone trading pesos for Bitcoin. As it turned out, not only did I find individuals, but I also found local dealers.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to buy Bitcoin,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;you pay us 15% over market. If you want to sell, we pay you at least 10% over market.&rdquo;</p><p>I did even better than the 10%. Bitcoin was selling for about USD 6,000 at the time, and I got between USD 6,800 and USD 7,000. The people I dealt with told me they&rsquo;d buy as much crypto as I could lay my hands on.</p><p>The crypto dealers&rsquo; business model makes a lot of sense, and it&rsquo;s in big demand.</p><p>They have high-net-worth clients looking to get their money out of the country. In big amounts and FAST.</p><p>So, the dealers keep a healthy stash of cryptocurrency on hand, offering their customers the ability to get their money out of the country while bypassing the banking system. Instead of paying the government&rsquo;s outrageous 33% tax, the customers are glad to pay the dealer his 15%.</p><p><b>This a big change from the capital-control powers governments used to have just a few years ago!</b></p><p>Back then, when countries imposed capital controls, they could ban black-market dealers and throw them in jail.</p><p>Businesspeople would dress like hippies, stuff their backpacks with currency and try walking across the border. But border agents caught them frequently, and the controls were often effective.</p><p>Not now! Not in the crypto age!</p><p><b>The flight to Bitcoin in Argentina is the same thing that&rsquo;s happening in nearly every country that has tried to impose currency controls.</b></p><p>Argentina&rsquo;s national currency is down 50% against the greenback just in the past year. And now, the same folks who helped cause the crisis have just been voted back into office.</p><p>So, no matter what governments do or don&rsquo;t do, you can see why crypto assets like Bitcoin are the only chance citizens in these countries have to protect their wealth.</p><p>At the end of the day, what do governments accomplish with bans or draconian controls?</p><p>They help to increase awareness of cryptocurrencies. They&rsquo;re making crypto more popular.</p><p>Maybe we should send them a thank-you email:</p><p>&ldquo;Keep up the good work, guys.&rdquo;</p>
