<h2><b>How to Buy Green Bitcoin: Step-By-Step Walkthrough</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This section will show you how to buy $GBTC on presale in 5 simple steps:</p>
<h3><b>Step 1: Download a Cryptocurrency Wallet</b></h3>
<p>To start, investors must download a cryptocurrency wallet of their choice, which is compatible with the token presale. For example, you can download MetaMask or Wallet Connect.</p>
<p>Either download the crypto wallet as an extension on your desktop/laptop or get the crypto wallet app via iOS or Android. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new wallet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140060" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939645-metamask-crypto-wallet.png" alt="MetaMask wallet" width="900" height="419" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939645-metamask-crypto-wallet.png 1030w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939645-metamask-crypto-wallet-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939645-metamask-crypto-wallet-1024x477.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939645-metamask-crypto-wallet-768x358.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939645-metamask-crypto-wallet-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939645-metamask-crypto-wallet-150x70.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><b>Step 2: Buy Ethereum or Tether </b></h3>
<p>Investors must hold either Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT) in their crypto wallets before purchasing $GBTC. These tokens can be purchased from a suitable crypto platform and transferred to the wallet.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the purchase can be made with a card.</p>
<h3><b>Step 3: Connect the Wallet to the Presale </b></h3>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin presale website</a>, and select ‘Connect Wallet’. You will see two crypto wallet options &#8211; MetaMask and Wallet Connect. Click the wallet you hold, and follow the instructions on the screen to officially connect the wallet to the presale.</p>
<h3><b>Step 4: Buy Green Bitcoin</b></h3>
<p>Click on the payment method of your choice &#8211; ETH/USDT/Card, and enter the amount of tokens you wish to purchase. You must buy at least $10 GBTC ($3.09, at the time of writing) to complete the transaction. Click on ‘Buy Now’ to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>You can also select the ‘Buy and Stake’ option to instantly stake your holdings once the purchase is complete.</p>

<h2><b>Green Bitcoin: Explained</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Green Bitcoin ($GBTC) is a revolutionary <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> platform that will offer a gaming environment, offer staking and community rewards to token holders, and is currently soaring on presale.</p>
<p>This cryptocurrency combines the legacy of Bitcoin and is built on the eco-friendly Ethereum blockchain. Green Bitcoin is an environmentally friendly alternative to Bitcoin &#8211; as it is built on the eco-friendly Ethereum blockchain. After switching to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Ethereum is using 10,000 times less energy than the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140062" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939749-what-is-green-bitcoin.png" alt="What is Green Bitcoin?" width="900" height="399" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939749-what-is-green-bitcoin.png 1092w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939749-what-is-green-bitcoin-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939749-what-is-green-bitcoin-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939749-what-is-green-bitcoin-768x340.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939749-what-is-green-bitcoin-150x66.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin is based on the proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain &#8211; known to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121009564">consume a high level of electricity</a>. This is due to the vast amount of computational power that is needed to run Bitcoin mining rigs, to extract new tokens.</p>
<p>$GBTC, the native cryptocurrency, is an ERC-20 token. By adopting the Ethereum blockchain, Green Bitcoin will leverage this network&#8217;s robust security protocols and smart contract generation capabilities.</p>
<p>Thus, Green Bitcoin can leverage a staking mechanism that not only reduces its environmental impact but also offers multiple reward-earning opportunities to token holders.</p>
<h3><b>Earn Rewards with the BTC Price Prediction Game</b></h3>
<p>Green Bitcoin will introduce a gamified green staking model &#8211; where $GBTC token holders can earn daily rewards. According to the <a href="https://www.greenbitcoin.xyz/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Green Bitcoin whitepaper</a>, the platform will soon launch its own BTC token price prediction game.</p>
<p>Investors can stake their $GBTC holdings on the smart contract, and then interact with Bitcoin’s market activity by making daily price predictions. Your forecasts will be made for the following day’s BTC price. Successful forecasts and predictions will be rewarded from a staking reward pool.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140063" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939799-green-bitcoin-gamified-staking.png" alt="Green Bitcoin gamified staking" width="900" height="542" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939799-green-bitcoin-gamified-staking.png 880w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939799-green-bitcoin-gamified-staking-300x181.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939799-green-bitcoin-gamified-staking-768x463.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939799-green-bitcoin-gamified-staking-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This is a great opportunity for investors who missed out on Bitcoin’s sensational bull run. The staking rewards will be paid out daily &#8211; until December 31st, 2025. The rewards will depend on the number of tokens you have staked in the pool.</p>
<p>Once the gaming and staking platform launches post the exchange listing, Green Bitcoin can become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">fastest growing crypto</a> tokens.</p>
<h3><b>Get Up to 20% in Staking Bonuses and High APYs</b></h3>
<p>Apart from giving you access to the price prediction game, Green Bitcoin’s staking mechanism offers other advantages. To reward long-term token holders, Green Bitcoin will offer staking bonuses.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the token bonuses available depending on your staking period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily staking &#8211; Earn daily staking rewards depending on the number of tokens staked.</li>
<li>Weekly staking &#8211; Get a 5% token bonus on top of your daily staking rewards.</li>
<li>Monthly staking &#8211; Get a 10% token bonus on top of your daily staking rewards.</li>
<li>Six-month staking &#8211; Get a 20% token bonus on top of your daily staking rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140065" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939886-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-11-33-09-am.png" alt="Green Bitcoin staking APYs" width="900" height="351" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939886-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-11-33-09-am.png 1307w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939886-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-11-33-09-am-300x117.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939886-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-11-33-09-am-1024x400.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939886-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-11-33-09-am-768x300.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939886-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-11-33-09-am-150x59.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Therefore, the longer you lock up $GBTC, the higher the rewards. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-staking-platforms.htm">best crypto staking platforms</a>, Green Bitcoin is offering up to 734% in annual yields to token stakers. By comparison, the average annual staking yields in 2023 <a href="https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/ethereum-staking-yields/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20average%20yield,go%20above%2010%25%20as%20well.">fluctuated between 4% and 6%</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that as more tokens are staked on the Green Bitcoin ecosystem, the staking yields will decrease.</p>
<h2><b>Green Bitcoin Presale &amp; Tokenomics </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Carrying forward the legacy of Bitcoin, Green Bitcoin has decided to adopt similar tokenomics. Just like Bitcoin, Green Bitcoin has a total of 21 million tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140066" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics.png" alt="Green Bitcoin tokenomics" width="900" height="444" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics.png 1236w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics-1024x505.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics-768x379.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939929-green-bitcoin-tokenomics-150x74.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>27.5% of the token supply will be offered through the staking rewards &#8211; offering $GBTC to those who are actively participating in the community. For the ongoing presale, Green Bitcoin has allocated 40% of its supply (8.4 million tokens).</p>
<p>At press time, $GBTC is priced at $0.309 per token. Conducting one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> in recent times &#8211; Green Bitcoin has raised over $320K in only a couple days since launch.  Once the presale is completed, Green Bitcoin will conduct the initial exchange offering for $GBTC.</p>
<p>Another 10% of the token supply has been allocated for the upcoming CEX (Centralized Exchange) and DEX (Decentralized Exchange) listings. The listing price is set at $0.6 per token &#8211; a near 2x jump from current levels.</p>
<p>Green Bitcoin also wants to craft impactful campaigns that help spread the project’s popularity. Thus, 17.5% of the supply will be used for marketing purposes. The remaining 5% of the token supply will be allocated through community rewards.</p>
<p>A successful presale campaign can help $GBTC list on some of the tier-one crypto exchanges, which can potentially help the trading volume increase in the future.</p>

<h2><b>Green Bitcoin: Future Roadmap </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The following section takes a closer look at Green Bitcoin’s future roadmap &#8211; which discusses the project’s upcoming initiatives and developments:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140069" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701940022-green-bitcoin-roadmap.png" alt="Green Bitcoin roadmap" width="900" height="315" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701940022-green-bitcoin-roadmap.png 1267w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701940022-green-bitcoin-roadmap-300x105.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701940022-green-bitcoin-roadmap-1024x359.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701940022-green-bitcoin-roadmap-768x269.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701940022-green-bitcoin-roadmap-150x53.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Presale Launch</b> &#8211; The current focus is on the ongoing $GBTC presale. With the money raised, Green Bitcoin will fund its tech and marketing to build a strong platform core.</li>
<li><b>Token Launch</b> &#8211; After the presale ends, a portion of the $GBTC token supply will be unlocked once the exchange listing takes place.</li>
<li><b>Staking Rewards and Prediction goes live</b> &#8211; After the exchange listing, Green Bitcoin will launch its main features &#8211; the staking rewards mechanism and the price prediction game. This will help attract investors to the project.</li>
<li><b>Predict to Earn 2.0</b> &#8211; In the future, Green Bitcoin will add additional features to its gameplay mode, to help grow the project.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Reasons to Buy Green Bitcoin During Presale</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Before you purchase $GBTC during the ongoing presale, let’s take a look at some of the top reasons to invest in this cryptocurrency:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Low Entry Price</b> &#8211; At press time, $GBTC is priced at $0.309 during the ongoing presale round. The price will increase per each presale round and eventually rise to $0.6 by the exchange listing. This equates to a price increase of more than 94%.</li>
<li><b>High Staking APYs</b> &#8211; Early investors can stake and earn up to 734% in annual yields. As more tokens are staked on the ecosystem, the yields will reduce.</li>
<li><b>Benefit of the BTC Price</b> &#8211; While BTC has already offered enormous gains to early investors, it may not be cost-effective to invest a huge amount in this cryptocurrency. Green Bitcoin will allow you to earn token rewards by predicting the daily BTC price through its staking mechanism.</li>
<li><b>Low Token Supply</b> &#8211; $GBTC has a supply of only 21 million, 40% of which is available for the presale. If the demand for the token increases, the price can steadily increase as more investors are attracted to the platform.</li>
</ul>

New cryptocurrency projects tend to attract high levels of volatility, making it difficult to get an exact idea of the future price range. While many tokens offer enormous gains in the months following their exchange listing, long-term returns may be hard to sustain.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to evaluate the project’s utility and key features to get a better idea of the future price. Green Bitcoin is presenting itself as a sustainable alternative for Bitcoin &#8211; by adopting the eco-friendly proof-of-stake mechanism. This is coming at a time when proof-of-work projects including Bitcoin are facing criticism for their energy-intensive set-up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140068" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939972-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-1-51-19-pm.png" alt="Green Bitcoin presale" width="900" height="512" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939972-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-1-51-19-pm.png 1256w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939972-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-1-51-19-pm-300x171.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939972-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-1-51-19-pm-1024x583.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939972-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-1-51-19-pm-768x437.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701939972-screen-shot-2023-12-07-at-1-51-19-pm-150x85.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Secondly, Green Bitcoin’s tokenomics can help the token price flourish with growing demand. With a limited supply of only 21 million &#8211; Green Bitcoin stores a certain amount of tokens for liquidity, its presale, and staking rewards. Thus, the goal is to foster a vibrant ecosystem in the long term.</p>
<p>As the supply slowly gets unlocked, the price will push up as there will be fewer tokens left. This is the same for Bitcoin &#8211; which is growing in demand as it approaches its maximum supply, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/802775/worldwide-cryptocurrency-maximum-supply/#:~:text=As%20a%20rule%20of%20thumb,cryptocurrency%20reaches%20its%20maximum%20supply.">making it harder to mine</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the plethora of use cases ranging from the price prediction game to the staking rewards and token bonuses can help grow the demand for $GBTC. A secure platform, Green Bitcoin’s contract has been <a href="https://coinsult.net/projects/green-bitcoin/">audited by Coinsult</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, $GBTC has the potential to grow by 10x in the long term. From the listing price, a 10x price increase will take the token price to $6. However, the price can also be affected by the demand for the BTC price prediction game and staking returns.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Our how to buy Green Bitcoin guide offers a simple walkthrough for how to invest in the $GBTC token presale. Green Bitcoin uses an innovative green staking model, offering high token rewards and staking benefits.</p>
<p>Investors can buy $GBTC by connecting their crypto wallets to the Green Bitcoin presale website, entering the purchase amount, and confirming the transaction.</p>

<p>After the cryptocurrency bear market wiped out more than 50% of the sector’s market cap, investors are looking for new assets to invest in. Tamadoge is an exciting new crypto project that offers platform members play-to-earn (P2E) opportunities and looks set for a huge future.</p>
<p>This guide reviews the ongoing Tamadoge presale and analyzes the Tamaadoge price prediction for 2023 &#8211; 2025. </p>
<h2><strong>Tamadoge Price Prediction Summarized</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A P2E platform, <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en"><strong>Tamadoge</strong></a> leverages the TAMA token to incentivize users to buy, sell and trade Tamadoge pets &#8211; dog-like virtual characters minted as NFTs. Players can buy these NFTs on the Tama store and compete with their virtual avatars in community-wide competitions to earn TAMA rewards. </p>
<p>In the future, the platform will incorporate unique P2E elements such as augmented reality (AR) apps and P2E arcades to position itself as a top cryptocurrency project. Due to the successful Tamadoge presale and the multiple use cases, we have a bullish outlook on the future Tamadoge price. Here is a quick overview of the potential price of Tamadoge from 2023 &#8211; 2025. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023</strong> &#8211; Tamadoge will incorporate several P2E elements, including an AR app, P2E arcade and several metaverse partnerships by the end of 2023. Therefore, the token can trade between $0.05 to $0.3 by 2023.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025</strong> &#8211; Tamadoge would have cemented itself as one of the best P2E cryptocurrencies by 2025. Due to the token&#8217;s deflationary tokenomics, 5% burning mechanism system and future listings, TAMA can reach $1 by 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>TAMA Coin &#8211; Price &amp; Presale History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Tamadoge (TAMA) is an exciting <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>new cryptocurrency</u></a> that offers P2E gaming opportunities to allow participants to earn crypto-based rewards. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://tamadoge.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Tamadoge-Whitepaper-V1-EN-1.pdf"><u>Tamadoge whitepaper</u></a>, TAMA will have a maximum supply of 2 billion tokens, 50% of which were made available in the presale round. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87731/220571/tama-tokenomics.jpg" alt="Tamadoge coin tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The Tamadoge presale went live in August 2022, releasing TAMA at $0.01 per token with a total presale target of $10 million. Launching one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>best crypto presales</u></a>, TAMA sold out its beta presale hard cap targets of $2 million in only 10 days.</p>
<p> This led the development team to increase the presale targets from $10 million to $19 million. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87731/221116/tama-presale-completed.jpg" alt="Tamadoge USD amount raised in a presale" /></figure>
<p>The Tamadoge presale utilized an incremental price increase system, resulting in the constant rise of TAMA tokens as the tokens were sold. On September 18th, Tamadoge sold out its presale, collecting $19 million. </p>
<p>TAMA was then listed at $0.03 for its IEO on OKX and quickly pumped to an all-time high of $0.194 in early October &#8211; more than 500% from its list price and nearly 2,000 from its presale price.</p>
<p>The price dropped back in the wake of the crypto winter and the collapse of FTX, as well as poor macroeconomic conditions, but has settled at around $0.015 for now.</p>
<p>However, with several milestones on its roadmap for 2023, the price is expected to pump when market conditions improve.</p>

<h3><strong>Tamadoge Price Summary</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Tamadoge has a maximum supply of 2 billion tokens.</li>
<li>5% of the supply will be burned for TAMA store transactions when the game is live.</li>
<li>On September 18th 2022, Tamadoge sold out its presale, raising $19 million.</li>
<li>TAMA listed for $0.03 for its IEO on OKX.</li>
<li>It pumped to an all-time high of $0.0194.</li>
<li>The price has since retracted amid poor macroeconomic conditions.</li>
<li>It has settled at $0.015 but experts predict a big 2023.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Tamadoge Price Prediction By 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In the medium term, Tamadoge can potentially provide further profits to investors. </p>
<p>But, Tamadoge has a lot of new P2E projects lined up throughout 2023. For example, the development team is working on an Augmented-Reality (AR) based Tamadoge app, which will retain the same P2E dynamics as the web-based platform. This will provide platform users with an easier way to access the decentralized platform. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87731/220574/new-tama-roadmap.jpg" alt="Tamadoge ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>According to the Tamadoge roadmap, the AR app is expected to be ready by Q4 2023. Along with the live competitions, users can earn TAMA tokens by interacting with their pets through the AR app, which will incentivize players to use the platform. </p>
<p>Another interesting project is the Tamadoge P2E arcade &#8211; which will host a collection of different Tamadoge arcade games and will incorporate physical Tama rewards. This P2E feature is expected to go live in Q3 2023. The Tamadoge roadmap also states that the team will work on major metaverse partnerships in 2023 and coin listings on all the major cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>
<p>As the use cases of Tamadoge will be more prevalent with all the P2E platform releases, 2023 is gearing up to be an important year for the token. Aiming to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm"><u>best metaverse crypto coins</u></a>, TAMA has the potential to explode by 5x or more by the end of 2023. </p>
<p>Considering the above elements, TAMA can reach a high of $0.3 by the end of 2023. However, if the ongoing market conditions worsen, a low of $0.05 is on the cards. </p>
<h2><strong>Tamadoge Price Prediction By 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Tamaverse aims to be a virtual ecosystem that will incorporate several P2E elements to help grow the TAMA ecosystem. Moreover, Tamadoge will stand out long-term due to its deflationary tokenomics. </p>
<p>As we have witnessed with Bitcoin, the lower token supply has been one of the main factors that have led to the increase in price. Similarly, Tamadoge provides a limited token supply of just 2 billion coins. In comparison, Dogecoin has increased its token supply from 100 billion to 132 billion since its inception. </p>
<p>Tamadoge is also adding a token burn mechanism &#8211; as 5% of all TAMA spent on the ecosystem will be burnt to ensure the demand outweighs the supply. Therefore, it is likely that the price of Tamadoge will be profitable in the long run. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87731/220575/tama-burning.jpg" alt="Tamadoge tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>To sustain the project’s marketing objectives, 30% of the tokens spent will be set aside for marketing purposes. The remaining 65% will be distributed among P2E prize pools and awarded to the competition winners. Therefore, the tokenomics of Tamadoge makes it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm"><u>best long term cryptocurrency projects</u></a> to invest in. </p>
<p>To promote long-term holding, Tamadoge will charge no transaction tax while buying and selling the token. The development team believes that value should be generated in the ecosystem without taking a cut from the platform participants. </p>
<p>After the presale, TAMA will be valued at $19 million. Decentraland, one of the top P2E games, has a market cap of $1.3 billion at a price of $0.7. However, Decentraland was valued at $10.9 billion during its all-time highs (ATHs). </p>
<p>At the same current valuation, the price of TAMA would equate to $2. To reach a price of $1, TAMA would need a market cap of just $650 million. By 2025, the $1 mark may be possible due to the multiple use-cases, token listings and deflationary tokenomics. </p>

<h2><strong>Features of Tamadoge </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>One of the main differences between Tamadoge and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm"><u>best meme coins</u></a> is the use cases that the new cryptocurrency will provide. The sections below discuss some of the most important features Tamadoge provides users. </p>
<h3><strong>NFT Interoperability </strong></h3>
<p>TAMA is the native token of the Tamaverse. This P2E environment leverages NFTs and cryptos to provide investors with a chance to earn money by competing in various gaming activities. Built on the Ethereum network, Tamadoge allows investors to purchase NFT items built using the ERC-20 token standard. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87731/220576/tamadoge-cryptocurrency-1.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto project" /></figure>
<p>These NFTs are known as Tamadoge pets &#8211; comprising unique dog-like avatars that can be used in community-wide competitions. To grow and breed the pets, participants can purchase other virtual items from the Tama store and make the NFTs capable of competing for points on a monthly leaderboard. The top performers are rewarded with TAMA. </p>
<h3><strong>Deflationary Asset </strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important features of Tamadoge is its deflationary nature. Most meme tokens offer trillions of individual tokens to investors, reducing the price and making the coin an inflationary asset. Due to the growing supply of the asset, the price will reduce as the supply increases. </p>
<p>Tamadoge looks to follow the Bitcoin approach &#8211; providing a limited token supply which cannot increase over time. With a total supply of 2 billion tokens &#8211; 50% were available during the presale, 20% will be listed on exchanges, and 30% will be released over the next 10 years via minting operations. </p>
<p>This ensures that the token stays competitive in the long term since the demand will grow with the reduced supply. Since 5% of all tokens spent are burnt, there is a high possibility for the price of TAMA to increase. </p>
<h3><strong>Governance Token of a Growing P2E environment</strong></h3>
<p>Tamadoge is soon to officially launch the pet store, with NFTs already available on OpenSea. However, the TAMA token will also be the native cryptocurrency for upcoming projects. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87731/220577/tama-ar-app.jpg" alt="Tamadoge mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Since TAMA will be used to settle transactions on the AR-based app and the arcade game, the use cases will slowly increase. The growth of the Tamaverse will increase the trading volume of TAMA. Thus, TAMA is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm"><u>best altcoins to buy</u></a> right now. </p>
<h2><strong>Factors Affecting the Tamadoge Price</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A new cryptocurrency, Tamadoge (TAMA) may experience a heavy shift in price movements regularly. Here are some of the main factors to look at when analyzing the price of Tamadoge. </p>
<h2><strong>Cryptocurrency Bull/Bear Markets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Last year, some of the biggest cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have corrected by more than 70%. Tamadoge did hit highs of $0.194 &#8211; a near-2,000% pump from presale price &#8211; but has also been affected by the wider struggles in the space, with the bear market ongoing for months.</p>
<p>However, like any market cycle, the bear market will eventually end and the bull will return. With the next Bitcoin halving approaching in early 2024, many experts predict a bull run will start in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.</p>
<p>Therefore, many investors believe that the token may soar further when the bull market begins. While we cannot predict when the crypto markets will revive, the cryptocurrency space has always produced higher highs after initial setbacks. Therefore, Tamadoge can be a long-term investment for those backing the coins’ use cases and growth potential.</p>
<h2>Access TAMA Through Binance</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>TamaDoge is not currently available on Binance, at the present time. However, you can purchase a coin on Binance such as BNB, and swap it for TAMA on a major exchange or decentralized exchange. This is made easier by the fact that Binance offers a self-custody wallet to access the world of Web3. </p>
<p>Even if the coin is not currently accessible, it&#8217;s worth setting up an account with the world&#8217;s largest exchange by trade volume. It has low spot fees (0.1%) and a large list of cryptocurrencies for trading. It also provides a stake-to-earn program, a dedicated NFT marketplace, a P2P marketplace, and trading bots. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136808" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1701098733-screen-shot-2023-11-27-at-15-22-51-e1701098752393.png" alt="Tama On Binance" width="900" height="438" /></p>
<p>Other reasons we recommend this is due to the fact that Binance account creation is quick and because the interface is very easy to use. Applications are available for desktop and mobile, with excellent user feedback. </p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a great place to purchase coins initially and trade them for others. Plus, it&#8217;s the biggest exchange in the world by total trade volume, and it might just list TAMA at a future date. </p>

<h2><strong>Tamadoge: The Best Cryptocurrency in 2023? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>After analyzing the Tamadoge cryptocurrency project, we believe TAMA could be one of the top assets to buy in 2023. After the successful presale, which raised $19 million, Tamadoge was listed on the OKX exchange and soared in price, showing huge investor appetite.</p>
<p>Secondly, the development team has laid down a long-term strategy for Tamadoge &#8211; with upcoming token listings, metaverse partnerships and future P2E gaming elements. Thus, Tamadoge will be seen as a valuable token used to maintain the Tamaverse rather than a pump and dump. </p>
<p>Finally, Tamadoge’s deflationary tokenomics makes it a great hedge against inflation. Unlike fiat currency, Tamadoge cannot be printed more and more. The limited supply will give it a competitive edge since more investors will be looking to purchase a smaller number of coins.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Tamadoge (TAMA) has the potential to become one of the top cryptos in space. With its deflationary tokenomics and multiple use cases, TAMA can reach the $1 mark by 2025. However, investors should conduct their own research and analysis before investing any money due to the uncertain and volatile nature of the crypto markets. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Should you Invest in Tamadoge?</strong></p>
<p>Tamadoge is the native token of the Tamaverse &#8211; a P2E environment which leverages the TAMA token to offer NFT and play-to-earn use cases, unlike many of its meme coin rivals.</p>
<p><strong>What is TAMA valued at?</strong></p>
<p>TAMA was listed at its IEO for $0.03 and reached an all-time high of $0.194. Amid the crypto bear market it is trading at $0.015 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>RichQuack is a relatively new meme token that has exploded in popularity with its strong social media backing and deflationary tokenomics. Many investors are now considering whether or not to invest in this meme cryptocurrency and wondering what the future price of QUACK could be. </p>
<p>This guide forecasts a potential RichQuack price prediction for 2023 &#8211; 2030 by analyzing the project’s features, upcoming releases and historical price performance. </p>
<h2><strong>RichQuack Price Prediction Summary </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A hyper-deflationary cryptocurrency built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), RichQuack has a high maximum supply of 10 quadrillion tokens. However, the token has been designed to decrease in supply in the long term. </p>
<p>With over 53% of the maximum supply now burnt, investors can earn cryptocurrency rewards by staking, voting and accessing launchpads to access new projects. The section below summarizes a possible RichQuack coin price prediction for 2023 &#8211; 2030. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023 &#8211;</strong> By the end of 2023, RichQuack is expected to release its platform launchpad and incubator project. Some popular algorithmic price prediction sites expect the cryptocurrency to increase by 150% by the end of 2023, although those can be unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025 &#8211; </strong>As a hyper deflationary asset, QUACK has already burnt more than 53% of the maximum token supply. As the total supply further decreases, an increase in demand could see the token retest its previous all-time high of $0.000000011.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>RichQuack Coin Price History</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Built on the Binance Smart Chain, RichQuack (QUACK) is a BEP-20 token that follows a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm. 21 validators are chosen daily to validate the transactions and maintain the platform&#8217;s security. </p>
<h3><strong>Price Increase of RichQuack</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most trending <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-deflationary-cryptocurrency.htm">deflationary cryptocurrency</a> tokens, QUACK runs on hyper deflationary tokenomics to reduce its overall supply.  Despite its maximum supply of 10 quadrillion, over 53% of the tokens have been burnt since the release of this cryptocurrency. QUACK began trading on June 9th, 2021, at under $0.00000000001 per token. Its low price is due to the large token supply, but the RichQuack price could experience upwards momentum as the supply decreases over time. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91504/316638/richquack-price-prediction.jpg" alt="RichQuack to USD chart" /></figure>
<p>In November 2021, QUACK reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.000000011. This tremendous price increase can be credited to the solid RichQuack social media following, making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> in the space. With a Twitter following of more than 283K, the RichQuack community is among the strongest in the meme coins space. </p>
<h3><strong>Price Correction</strong></h3>
<p>However, such cryptocurrencies tend to attract high levels of volatility. However, RichQuack investors are optimistic it could be one of the most sustainable meme tokens due to the variety of use cases it provides. </p>
<p>RichQuack offers a staking feature for members to earn regular rewards, along with an upcoming launchpad which will offer access to new projects. Moreover, the decrease in token supply makes RichQuack a favourable token over even some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">most popular &#8216;shitcoins&#8217;</a> like Dogecoin (DOGE), which has inflationary tokenomics.</p>

<h3><strong>RichQuack Pumps Amidst Social Media Following</strong></h3>
<p>In October last year, QUACK cryptocurrency increased in price by over 2.5x. One of the main reasons for this price pump was the growth and reach of RichQuack on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Most of that move was retraced in November, leading some to question whether its following was organic or botted. Others attributed the correction to the fallout from the FTX collapse, and Bitcoin crashing to $15,400.</p>

<p><br />Currently, the RichQuack crypto price is at $0.000000001126, with a market cap of just under $50 million and a circulating supply of 4.4 quadrillion tokens. </p>
<h3><strong>RichQuack Price History: Summarized</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>QUACK was launched in June 2021 at $0.00000000001 per token.</li>
<li>In November 2021, RichQuack reached an all-time high of $0.0000211.</li>
<li>The meme coin plunged by over 99% by the beginning of 2022.</li>
<li>In October 2022, RichQuack pumped by 250%, becoming one of the most trending meme cryptos.</li>
<li>In Q3 of 2023, Richquack has experienced some peaks and valleys. At press time, it is trading around the $0.00000000059 mark.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>RichQuack Price Prediction 2023</strong></h3>
<p>In the medium term, RichQuack has the potential to grow further in price. One of the main reasons for this is the upcoming launchpad feature. As part of the project roadmap, RichQuack aims to create a decentralized launchpad for new blockchain-based platforms as part of the project roadmap. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91504/228943/richquack-launchpad.jpg" alt="QUACK token staking" /></figure>
<p>During the beginning of this feature, RichQuack will feature solely QUACK-based incubated projects. Once new projects are listed on the launchpad, platform users can contribute towards funding new decentralized exchange IDOs (initial DEX offerings). To participate in this feature, one must hold and stake at least 100B QUACK. </p>
<p>Another popular feature of RichQuack will be staking &#8211; allowing investors to access voting rights for RichQuack’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Therefore, RichQuack is also positioned to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a> in the space. </p>
<p>With some of these projects expected to roll out by next year, we may witness an increase in trading volume. Since features such as the launchpad offer users the choice to fund unreleased projects, the QUACK token can increase in price following an increase in stakings. </p>
<p>According to Digital Coin Price, a popular crypto forecasting algorithm, RichQuack could reach a maximum price of $0.00000000378 by 2023. This indicates a growth of nearly 150% from current levels. On the other hand, the website predicts a low of 0.00000000313 by the end of 2023. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming launchpad and incubator projects, investors may prefer staying tracking the latest developments of RichQuack to stay tuned with new release information. </p>
<h3><strong>RichQuack Price Prediction 2025 &#8211; 2030</strong></h3>
<p>Despite the instant growth that meme tokens can provide, they have been known to create major market pumps and dumps. One of the main differences between RichQuack and other meme tokens lies in this cryptocurrency’s tokenomics. </p>
<p>Despite boasting a 10 quadrillion token supply, QUACK regularly burns through its token supply. Each QUACK transaction results in a 12% fee &#8211; 2% of which is burnt. Furthermore, 4% is sent back to the token holders, 4% is spent on a liquidity pool and 2% is used for marketing purposes. </p>
<p>Due to the tokenomics, RichQuack has already reduced its supply by burning 53% of the existing tokens. For RichQuack to sustain itself in the next decade, the regular token burns can help increase the price. Furthermore, RichQuack also offers an anti-whale feature by not allowing a single wallet to hold more than 1% of the available token supply. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91504/228945/richquack-tokenomics.jpg" alt="QUACK tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The platform also offers anti-rug pulling strategies &#8211; by providing locked token liquidity for 5 years. This will ensure that tokens cannot be regularly bought and sold, contributing to further volatility. </p>
<p>In the future, 50% of all profits from QUACK’s platform will be distributed to liquidity providers (LP) contributing to securing and validating the network. Since tokens must be staked to become an LP, the rewards will incentivize more holders to lock QUACK and earn more rewards. </p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-cheap-crypto-to-buy.htm">cheapest cryptos</a> to invest in right now, QUACK has the potential to become a top cryptocurrency in the next few years. We expect the cryptocurrency reach its previous ATH of $0.00002 by 2025. Despite already reaching this target in 2021, RichQuack would have launched several platform use cases by the end of this decade. </p>
<p>However, investing in meme tokens can often cause high levels of uncertainty. Digital Coin Price expects the cryptocurrency to experience further sideways momentum by 2025 &#8211; predicting an estimated price of $0.0000000144.</p>

<p><br />While RichQuack may experience further price increases with the expected release of the launchpad and the projects, we recommend <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a> as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptocurrency to invest</a> in today.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/91504/316639/wall-street-memes-under-1.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes logo" /></figure>
<p>Wall Street Memes (WSM) coin has captured the meme coin community&#8217;s attention with its soaring price. As the upcoming meme coin from a popular social media brand boasting over 1 million followers, WSM coin is currently in its presale stage, aiming to raise $13.5 million. Impressively, the project has already secured $12.9 million in ETH, USDT, and BNB.</p>
<p>Originally, Wall Street Memes gained traction through a Twitter handle that humorously targeted Wall Street, particularly after the Gamestop short squeeze event. In 2021, the brand launched its first NFT collection, Wall Street Bulls. However, the project has since lost momentum, raising concerns about the future value of WSM coin upon its market launch.</p>
<p>The current presale price of Wall Street Memes coin is $0.031, which will increase gradually. The project has set aside 50% of the total supply (1 billion coins out of 2 billion) for presale participants, with 20% allocated to CEX/DEX listings and liquidity provisions. Additionally, 30% of the coins will be distributed as community rewards.</p>
<p>Despite its high market cap of $31.3 million, which is significant for a meme coin, potential dilution and the introduction of new coins raise doubts about generating substantial returns. </p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Does RichQuack have a future?</strong></p>
<p>In October last year, RichQuack has become one of the most popular meme tokens and increased by 250%. In the future, RichQuack can remain a bullish investment due to its decreasing token supply. This platform will also release its own launchpad and give users rewards through its liquidity pools. </p>
<p><strong>When was RichQuack coin launched?</strong></p>
<p>RichQuack was launched in June 2021 at a price of just $0.00000000001 per token.</p>
<p><strong>Is RichQuack a good investment?</strong></p>
<p>Like any other cryptocurrency investment, QUACK will be a high-risk asset to trade. However, the future of RichQuack will depend on its multiple platform use cases &#8211; including the new launchpad platform, the RichQuack DAO and the liquidity pools. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/119201/317050/thug-life-img.jpg" alt="How to Buy Thug Life Token on Uniswap" /></figure>
<p>In June 2023, Thug Life (THUG) launched its cryptocurrency presale which sold out after hitting its hard cap of $2.058M. This is a new meme cryptocurrency, which will soon be available for trading across most ETH-based DEXs including Uniswap. </p>
<p>Continue reading to learn more about this cryptocurrency project and to find out how to buy $THUG in a few simple steps. With such a successful presale that ended so soon after its launch, some meme coin degens believe it could explode.  </p>
<h2><strong>What is Thug Life Token?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Through the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/thuglife/">Thug Life</a> presale, investors had the opportunity to buy $THUG at the earliest stage possible. Most cryptocurrency tokens allow investors to get early access to the token by hosting an initial coin offering (ICO) stage. </p>
<p>Thug Life held a unique presale, as the tokens were available at the same price for only one round. From a total token supply of 4.2 billion, 70% (2.94) billion was allocated for the presale. All early investors who purchased this token did so at a low price of $0.0007. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/119201/318329/thug-life-sell-out.jpg" alt="Thug Life Crypto Homepage" /></figure>
<p>At the time of writing, Thug Life&#8217;s presale sold out just after 3 weeks and is set to explode in a similar fashion to the meme token Sponge. The token was priced at just $0.0007 and did not have a minimum purchase amount. By the end of the presale, Thug Life managed to raise a hard cap of $2.058 million. </p>
<p>Similar to some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a>, Thug Life does not offer much utility to investors. Instead, it promotes a sense of unity and laughter with the community. This cryptocurrency is meant for those who have been cheated by crypto pumps and dumps or for those investors that purchased other tokens during their peaks and lost their money. </p>

<h2><strong>Closer Look at the Top Proof of Stake Cryptocurrency to Buy </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Here is an in-depth analysis of the top 8 PoS cryptocurrencies to look at this year. Keep reading to learn about the features, tokenomics and price rises for the trending Proof of Stake coins in 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Top PoS ERC20 Crypto Offers 450% APY And a 25% Token Burn</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is a recently launched proof-of-stake coin with a dynamic APY above 450% (at present) and a 25% overall burn allocation to promote token scarcity. Currently, in round two, the entry price is just $0.0052, though this will rise to $0.0068 by the final round (round ten). </p>
<p>The overall yield for this PoS crypto is declining rapidly. But typically, presale yields tend to stabilize in the double digits for a considerable length of time. So while early investment offers better yields and lower price entry, there are continual APY rewards.  </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130890" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Homepage" width="900" height="439" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> </p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token is a regulatory-focused PoS coin. This means that its roadmap is connected to important events in the wider crypto financial landscape. The main event is the ratification of Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Should this happen, it could have highly beneficial results for the price and trade volume of the $BTCETF coin. </p>
<p>Along with a generous APY and a discounted presale, Bitcoin ETF Token offers a 25% token burn. In five specific market instances, 5% of the total supply is burned. This includes the BTC ETF approval by the SEC, the price of BTC hitting $100,000, and the total AUM of the BTC ETF market reaching $1 billion. </p>
<p>There are 2.1 billion tokens overall with 840 million (40%) allocated to the presale, 525 million (25%) allocated to staking, 525 million (25%) allocated to burning, and 210 million (10%) allocated to DEX liquidity. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130891" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Staking Data" width="900" height="384" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05-300x128.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956360-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-50-05-768x328.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>So no tokens have been withheld by a core team, which is a positive indication in terms of transparency.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Earn High APYs and Collect Bitcoin Mining Power with this Stake-to-Mine Cryptocurrency, Presale is Soaring</strong></h3>
<p>The top proof of stake coin is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a>, a project converging token staking with cloud mining. Bitcoin Minetrix will offer cloud mining credits to investors that stake $BTCMTX &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. </p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Cloud mining has been run by large corporations that rent out mining power to individuals. However, this space is full of several scams and illegal activities. Therefore, Bitcoin Minetrix is introducing a new way for individuals and everyday people to make money through crypto mining. </p>
<p>The platform will offer cloud mining credits &#8211; ERC-20 non-tradable tokens. These are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be misplaced or tampered with. Therefore, more autonomy and transparency are given to the customers. One must buy and stake the $BTCMTX token to earn the credits. </p>
<p>They will earn passive income through high APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) and cloud mining credits. While these credits do not offer any direct value, they can be burned to earn Bitcoin mining power. With the mining power you collect, you get access to allocated mining times. This will be used to get a portion of mining revenues. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/332354/bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>This proof-of-stake cryptocurrency will launch the stake-to-mine platform after the end of the ongoing presale. Bitcoin Minetrix aims to raise a hard cap of $32 million through the presale. In only a few days, the presale has collected more than $300K. </p>
<p>Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at just $0.0114 per token.

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; ERC20 PoS Meme Campaign Offers Exciting Gameplay and 112% APY</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en"><u>Meme Kombat ($MK)</u></a> is an Ethereum-powered presale that offers meme vs meme combat, something that has not been done before. </p>
<p>Spectators can be on the outcomes of the fights using three primary mechanisms &#8211; P v P, P v Game, and Direct. </p>
<p>There is also an option to place side bets on more specific items, something which could enhance the gameplay considerably.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/332609/screen-shot-2023-10-04-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Aside from ROI from betting on fight outcomes, users can benefit from a solid 112% APY, which has stayed the same throughout the presale, as well as possible price appreciation. These are three means through which a participant can generate revenue through this PoS ecosystem.</p>
<p>For the first season, eleven of the world’s most famous tokens will be featured. This includes Doge, Kishu, Mong, Floki, Pepe, Pepe 2, Shiba, Baby Doge, Milady, Sponge, and Wojack. More memes and game options will be incorporated into the ecosystem once season one has been completed.</p>
<p>This staking ecosystem is set apart somewhat by the fact that the founder has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattw8047814774/">publicly revealed his identity</a>, something which is rarely seen within the presale industry. It has further conducted a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cmzG-n6ziqdjBfYU7DoRdSHzcxWXImk/view">smart contract audit</a>, so it scores well in terms of its transparency. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/332610/screen-shot-2023-10-04-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>While the meme industry is known somewhat for scams or dishonest projects, this does not appear to be one of them, and has done very well in terms of transparency.</p>
<p>Fight outcomes are also processed on chain and the fights are chosen based on random order sequencing. </p>
<p>Of the 120 million total $MK token supply, 60 million (50%) are available in the presale. 30% goes to staking and battle rewards, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to community rewards. The founders have kept nothing for themselves &#8211; yet another positive sign.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meme Kombat New 100x Potential Meme Coin Crypto Presale LIVE - 112% Staking Rewards &#x1f680;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pf5esWyKM5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<figure class="media">
<p style="text-align: left">According to some analysts, this could be a 10x or even 100x coin, as it is a unique concept in an industry known for large price movements in short time spans.</p>
<p>The price per token is $0.1667. </p>

Staking pools ensure the maintenance of the staked assets and validate the transactions on Cardano. Since PoS protocols support cheaper transactions, Cardano’s average transaction cost is roughly 0.16 ADA ($0.064) making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-energy-efficient-cryptocurrency.htm">most energy-efficient cryptocurrencies</a> on the market.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/220340/cardano-sep-14-price.jpg" alt="Cardano to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>After launching in 2017, Cardano implemented the Alonzo hard fork in 2021, which allowed the blockchain to support smart contracts and deploy various NFTs and DApps (decentralized applications). </p>
<p>Cardano deployed over 100 smart contracts within 24 hours of the Alonzo upgrade, resulting in an ADA price rally in September 2021. Cardano uses less energy than the best proof-of-work coins, similar to other PoS chains which is why some people consider Cardano to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-sustainable-cryptocurrency.htm">most sustainable cryptos</a> on the market. </p>
<p>Currently trading at $0.47, Cardano’s ADA has corrected from its all-time highs (ATHs) of $3.10 set in 2021. However, the growing use cases and the low-cost efficiency makes it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm"><u>cryptos with the most potential</u></a> for growth. </p>

<h3><strong>5. BNB &#8211; Native Crypto of Global Trading Platform</strong></h3>
<p>BNB (Binance Coin) is the governance token of Binance &#8211; the largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of the trading volume. Operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB follows the BEP standard to integrate smart contracts. </p>
<p>BNB follows the Proof of Stake Authority consensus, allowing a validator to stake a specified amount of BNB to validate transactions on the network. The token is the 5th largest cryptocurrency asset, with a market cap of $45 billion. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/220342/bnb-sep-14-price.jpg" alt="BNB to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>As the main token of the Binance exchange, BNB provides various benefits to Binance customers. Investors can get a 25% discount on spot trading crypto transactions on the platform, which generally costs 0.1% per transaction. Investors holding BNB can also save 10% on futures trading</p>
<p>The popular token is also used as a swapping mechanism for investors looking to purchase other BEP-based cryptocurrencies. For example, investors looking to buy Battle Infinity, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>best new cryptocurrency</u></a> assets, must purchase tokens with BNB. </p>
<p>After reaching an ATH of $690 in 2021, BNB is available to buy at only $280. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy BNB on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>6. Solana &#8211; Cryptocurrency Supporting 65,000 Transactions Per Second </strong></h3>
<p>Solana (SOL) is a fast and secure decentralized blockchain that uses an innovative protocol to validate its blocks. Solana uses the innovative Proof of History (PoH) protocol, allowing the network to process transactions as they come in. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/220343/sol-sep-14-price-chart.jpg" alt="Solana price chart" /></figure>
<p>The protocols architecture allows Solana to achieve high throughput &#8211; processing 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). On the other hand, the Ethereum blockchain processes an average of 17 TPS. The high scalability makes Solana an ideal network for decentralized applications (DApps), as developers can achieve high levels of scalability with Solana. </p>
<p>While PoH is the protocol Solana uses to improve speed, SOL still operates as a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism and supports staking protocols. SOL has proven to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm"><u>best altcoins</u></a> to invest in, as the token has increased from $0.78 in 2020 to $33 in September 2022. </p>
<p>Despite the enormous growth, SOL is 87% below its ATH and may be a potential long-term investment opportunity. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy Solana on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>7. Avalanche &#8211; PoS Cryptocurrency with 3 Sub-Blockchains</strong></h3>
<p>A layer-1 network, Avalanche (AVAX), is another smart contract-compatible platform that acts as a hub for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. A popular Proof of Stake crypto, Avalanche can support 6,500 TPS. </p>
<p>The high transaction speeds are made possible due to Avalanche&#8217;s unique blockchain architecture. The cryptocurrency consists of three different blockchains, each partaking a different role in validating the transaction process. The Exchange Chain (X-Chain) is responsible for sending and receiving funds on Avalanche. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/220345/avax-sept-price.jpg" alt="Avalanche price chart" /></figure>
<p>The Contract Chain (C-Chain) handles the transactions generated by DApps or smart contracts, while the Platform Chain (P-Chain) takes care of the staking/validator transactions on the Avalanche network. AVAX, the native token, is currently trading at $19 with a market cap of $5.6 billion. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy Avalanche on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>8. Algorand &#8211; Cryptocurrency with a Unique Take on the Proof of Stake Protocol</strong></h3>
<p>Algorand (ALGO) is a self-sustaining blockchain-based network that uses the Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) consensus, slightly different from the PoS algorithm. </p>
<p>With the PPoS network &#8211; platform users are chosen randomly to validate blocks and vote on proposals. The likelihood of a user being selected is linked to the amount of ALGO they stake. </p>
<p>Therefore, Algorand’s unique consensus strives to increase security, ensuring that minority shareholders do not have the power to harm the whole system. </p>
<p>In 2022, Algorand also developed the London Bridge &#8211; a trustless bridge that makes the network compatible with the Ethereum blockchain. In the long term, Algorand looks to solidify its DeFi ecosystem. Currently, ALGO is trading at $0.3 per token. </p>

<h2><strong>Proof of Stake Explained</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Proof of Stake (PoS) is a network consensus used to validate transactions on different blockchains. Since cryptocurrencies aim to be decentralized networks, transactions are validated in a distributed databases, known as blockchains. Each block comprises a new transaction which has been validated on the network. </p>
<p>To verify transactions using the Proof of Stake consensus, coin owners can act as the validators of transactions. Coin owners stake their own token holdings to get assigned the responsibility of validating transactions on the network. </p>
<p>These coin owners or ‘validators’ are selected at random, with each crypto network offering different rules to become a validator. For example, Ethereum requires its coin owners to stake at least 32 ETH ($51,000 at the time of writing) before standing a chance to become a network validator. Therefore some investors have asked &#8216;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-ethereum-a-good-investment.htm">is Ethereum a good investment</a> in 2023?&#8217;</p>
<h2><strong>Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When Bitcoin was launched in 2008, the cryptocurrency space adhered to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-work-coins.htm">Proof of Work</a> (PoW) consensus. With Proof of Work, the consensus provides an objective way for Bitcoin holders to navigate and manage transactions on the platform. </p>
<p>Proof of Work enables the concept of hashes, which comprise a long string of numbers, each assigned to a particular block. When a given data set is put through a hash function, it will only generate one hash. The hash will become totally unrecognisable if the data is tampered with or changed. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87621/220347/bitcoin-energy-consumption.jpg" alt="Bitcoin historical network power demand" /></figure>
<p>Each block is identified by its own unique hash, and one block connects directly to another on the blockchain. Therefore, it is impossible to tamper with a different set of hashes since one validates the other. Generating even one hash requires tremendous amounts of computational power. Therefore, the validators of Proof of Work networks are known as ‘Miners’. </p>
<p>For example, the production cost to mine one Bitcoin is expected to be around $13,000. The high cost of production combined with the limited token supply of Bitcoin is one of the big reasons for its high price. </p>
<p>However, the Proof of Work network has been blamed for requiring an unsustainable amount of energy to facilitate the process. Therefore, Proof of Stake originated as a quicker and cost-effective alternative to validate transactions. </p>
<h2><strong>Should You Invest in Proof of Stake Tokens?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before investing in PoS cryptocurrencies, investors should analyze why this particular asset class may be a good investment. The sections below discuss some of the main advantages of Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies. </p>
<h3><strong>Energy Efficient</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin miners are required to solve a complex mathematical equation to receive a Bitcoin. This process requires large among of energy, which has led many miners to switch to green energy resources. Since 2015, the energy requirements to mine one Bitcoin has rapidly increased. </p>
<h3><strong>Growth of the Consensus</strong></h3>
<p>With the PoS consensus, many blockchains are managing to increase scalability while quickly establishing new blocks on the blockchain. In fact, Ethereum has developed close competition from upcoming altcoins such as Cardano, Solana, and Algorand, all of which have applied this consensus. </p>
<p>The popularity of the Proof of Stake consensus is now at its peak, as Ethereum will be undergoing a network upgrade which will see it switch from the Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus. In the long term, it is more likely for PoS tokens to be more sustainable.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Buy Bitcoin ETF Token </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>After analyzing the top PoS cryptocurrencies, investors can decide on their preferred assets. The sections below highlight a step-by-step process on how to buy $BTCETF &#8211; one of the most popular cryptos to invest in right now. </p>

<h2><strong>Analyzing the Top Cryptos to Stake</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To get a better idea of the best staking tokens, the sections below provide an in-depth review of some of the best cryptocurrencies in this niche.<b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Best Staking Coin Offering 500% in Annual Yields</b></h3>
<p>Our first pick for the best staking coin in 2023 is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF). This is a new ERC-20 token, that offers staking privileges through its Ethereum-based smart contract. From a total supply of 2.1 billion &#8211; Bitcoin ETF Token will offer 25% through staking rewards. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130257" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699870105-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-12-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" width="900" height="418" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699870105-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-12-pm.png 1306w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699870105-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-12-pm-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699870105-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-12-pm-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699870105-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-12-pm-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699870105-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-12-pm-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token is a speculative coin that is linked to the fate of the upcoming Bitcoin ETF approvals. A Bitcoin ETF will allow traders to buy and sell Bitcoin like any other share in the stock market. Investors will also be able to trade BTC without holding the underlying asset. </p>
<p>However, the SEC is yet to approve the first Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin ETF Token will capitalize on the potential arrival of the first ETF, by conducting burning events and offering staking rewards.</p>
<p>For example, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 5% of its token supply once the SEC approves the first ETF. This is one of the project’s 5 milestones. The others include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Official release of the first Bitcoin ETF </li>
<li>The Bitcoin ETF holds $1 billion worth of assets under management</li>
<li>Bitcoin reaches $100K </li>
<li>$BTCETF crosses $100 million in trading volume </li>
</ul>
<p>In total 25% of the $BTCETF token supply will be burned as each of these 5 milestones are approved. Staking rewards will also be allocated as the milestones are completed. By purchasing $BTCETF early during the presale, investors can access higher staking APYs (Annual Percentage Yields). </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130278" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token staking" width="900" height="297" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm.png 1329w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm-300x99.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm-1024x337.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This is because the staking yields will keep decreasing as more tokens are locked on the smart contract. At press time, over 55 million tokens have been locked &#8211; resulting in APYs of 500%. The more tokens one stakes, the higher their yields. </p>
<p>To buy $BTCETF &#8211; you can access the ongoing presale. Currently, $BTCETF is priced at just $0.0052 per token. In a few days since the presale launched, Bitcoin ETF Token has raised nearly $500K. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Best Stake-to-Mine Crypto Offering Tokenized Cloud Mining Credits</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX) is a new cryptocurrency that combines token staking and cloud mining. On Bitcoin Minetrix, token holders can stake $BTCMTX and earn cloud mining credits. </p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is tokenizing cloud mining to make the process more transparent for users. Many cloud mining corporations often conduct dubious operations that tend to scam investors. However, Bitcoin Minetrix will offer cloud mining opportunities by leveraging blockchain technology. Thus, the cloud mining credits offered will be recorded on the blockchain, promising safety to the user. </p>

<p>To get these credits, investors must stake their $BTCMTX tokens on an Ethereum-powered smart contract. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Minetrix is offering staking rewards and APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) as high as 190%. You will earn the cloud mining credits by staking the tokens, which can be burned to access Bitcoin mining power. </p>
<p>The Bitcoin mining power is used to get an allocated mining time, which will help you earn a share of the mining revenue. Thus, Bitcoin Minetrix will heavily reduce the entry barrier since one does not have to purchase their own equipment and mining rigs. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/332056/bitcoin-minetrix-stake-to-mine.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Stake To Mine" /></figure>
<p>To get started with this top staking project, buy $BTCMTX through the ongoing presale. From a total supply of 4 billion &#8211; 2.8 billion tokens are being allocated equally across ten presale rounds. During the current round, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0114 per token. The price will jump to $0.0148<!-- notionvc: c784e4e6-2728-4e3c-ae21-92eac59f29f7 --> by the final round (stage 39). Moreover, the platform has an exciting minedrop with $30K rewards for early backers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix already raised  $3.1 million in just over a month since the presale began. Interested investors can get started by making a $10 minimum purchase.

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Best Play-to-Earn Staking Crypto</strong></h3>
<p>While meme coins are known to offer limited utility, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a> is a new meme project that is changing this notion &#8211; on the Meme Kombat ecosystem, users can earn high staking APYs, wager and earn rewards in the play-to-earn Battle Arena, and win thrilling prizes. </p>
<p>Once you <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-meme-kombat.htm">buy Meme Kombat</a> on presale, the tokens are automatically locked into the staking contract. At press time, the staking APY is set at 112%. After the end of the presale, users must re-stake their tokens for one lock-up period to earn the presale APY. The lock-up period is only 14 days in this ecosystem. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86643/331359/screen-shot-2023-09-25-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat Presale Page" /></figure>
<p>$MK, the native cryptocurrency, is priced at only $0.1667 during the ongoing presale round, and, unlike most of the other meme coins, Meme Kombat has a low token supply of just 120 million, with 50% of those allocated to the presale.</p>
<p>As well as earning APY, staked tokens are also used for wagering purposes in the Meme Kombat Battle Arena, which features battles of characters representing meme coin favorites. Powered by AI and the blockchain, results are immutable, fair, and transparent. Season one of the Battle Arena is expected to launch by Q3 2023, after the end of the presale. It will feature 11 meme coin avatars, such as Pepe Coin and Wojak.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/331360/screen-shot-2023-09-25-at.jpg" alt="Earn APY With Meme Kombat" />Not only can you fight on this play-to-earn platform, but you can also bet on live battles and earn prizes and free $MK tokens. One can also do side action betting, which gives users access to complex wagers such as first moves, outcomes, and more. </p>

<h3><strong>4. TG.Casino &#8211; Best Staking Coin for Casino Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>The next top staking token on our list is $TGC, the native cryptocurrency of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino">TG.Casino</a> online casino, which offers exciting rewards for holders. The TG.Casino leverages the $TGC token to give users access to exclusive casino games and several staking benefits. The presale has already raised more than $700k with investors earning huge APYs.</p>
<p>At press time, investors can purchase $TGC from the ongoing presale and stake the cryptocurrency to earn an APY of over 600%. The returns will fall once more tokens are staked on the ecosystem.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86643/331349/tg-casino-200k-raised.jpg" alt="TG Casino token presale page" /></p>
<p>For the ongoing presale, investors can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-tg-casino-token.htm">buy $TGC</a> for just $0.125 per token. However, one must buy at least 100 $TGC tokens to enter the presale. The <a href="https://tg-casino.gitbook.io/tg.casino-whitepaper/">TG.Casino whitepaper</a> states that staked token holders can also earn rewards through a profit-sharing system.</p>
<p>Once the casino starts making profits, a portion will be used to buy back tokens. 60% of the purchased tokens will be distributed as rewards to those staking and 40% of these tokens will be burnt, making the supply deflationary and increasing the token&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>Users can hold $TGC on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">online crypto casino</a> to avail several playing benefits &#8211; those who purchase $5K worth of $TGC on the presale can also earn free NFTs and other offers. </p>

<h3><strong>5. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Best Meme Token with Staking</strong></h3>
<p>Wall Street Memes ($WSM) has emerged as an exciting new staking meme token gaining much investor traction amid the recent meme coin trend. The project enjoyed one of the best crypto presales ever, raising more than $25 million.</p>
<p>Launched in late May 2023, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a> is from the same group that made the Wall St Bulls&#8217; Ethereum NFT collection &#8211; which sold out in 30 minutes in 2021 &#8211; and has built a community of over a million followers on social media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/332054/wsm-popular-memes.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes memes" /></p>
<p>WSM also has a robust staking feature with an estimated annual percentage yield (APY) of an impressive 50%. As of the latest data, participants in the staking program can earn 75 WSM per block as a reward. The collective investor enthusiasm is reflected in the total staked amount, which has reached over 375 million WSM tokens.</p>
<p>Moreover, WSM has also caught the attention of big names like Elon Musk, who has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954"><u>interacted with the platform’s Twitter</u></a>. This uptick in traction from investors can help the token list on top exchanges like Binance in the coming quarters.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/332055/wsm-token-home.jpg" alt="WSM token mission" /></figure>
<p>According to the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes whitepaper</u></a>, half of the two-billion $WSM token pool was available for presale. The remaining tokens are distributed as 30% for community rewards and 20% for maintaining exchange liquidity.</p>
<p>This approach is designed to prevent the issue of market dumping through team tokens, a problem seen with other cryptos. After the presale ended, $WSM listed on OKX &#8211; one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. The token is now also trading on the Huobi exchange. You can follow the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Wall Street Memes channel on Telegram</u></a> to keep track of the latest developments.</p>

<h3><strong>6. eTukTuk &#8211; Best Eco-Friendly Staking Coin</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> is a campaign launched from Sri Lanka, that aims to provide financial inclusion by replacing TukTuks with electric vehicles, which will be enhanced with AI for route optimization and task automation. It is a socio-economic revolution to remedy financial barriers while also helping the environment, an issue that is plaguing certain developing countries at present.</p>
<p>eTukTuk is offering high APY rewards of 33,487%, with rewards of 4.75 per BSC Block. A total of 144,981 TUK have been staked thus far. However, there are multiple benefits aside from direct staking on this BSC implementation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/332096/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token presale page" /></p>
<p>The Electric Vehicles put forward by eTukTuk are far cheaper in comparison to traditional TukTuks, meaning it will be more affordable for drivers to make a purchase. There will be no fuel costs, as the vehicles can be charged at designated charging stations, maintained by territory partners.</p>
<p>The TUK token will have additional benefits, as it will be the native token within the application used by drivers to oversee their operations. This can include discounts and bonuses for its usage.</p>
<p>These are Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) that are much more eco-friendly, in comparison to both cars and TukTuks. Sri Lanka and surrounding countries do not have a healthy carbon footprint. But if this solution is implemented on a wide scale, it would place it above developed countries in multiple regards.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://etuktuk.io/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>whitepaper</u></a> also highlights the fact that many people in impoverished regions suffer from the ill effects of air pollution, and this initiative can help with people’s well-being in multiple ways. It is further intended to be part of a much broader sharing economy, to improve the quality of life for drivers.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/332098/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk TUK token network" /></figure>
<p>It also includes the idea of “banking the unbanked”, something many crypto-based platforms have sought to do. In other words, eTukTuk is a gigantic project with multiple ongoing initiatives, the main ones being an upgrade to the transport industry and a reduction in carbon emissions.</p>
<p>It could do very well to improve socio-economic conditions for drivers if it takes off. More information can be found on the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>Telegram</u></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TukToken"><u>Twitter</u></a> accounts. </p>

<h3><strong>7. Doge Uprising &#8211; Best Low-Cap Staking Meme Coin</strong></h3>
<p>Doge Uprising ($DUP) is a doge-inspired Ethereum-powered crypto with a focus on manga and storytelling. The story starts in the year 2045, where Mark Zuckerberg has the world under a state of total surveillance. Only a group of brave Doge Mecha NFTs, commanded by pilots (NFT owners) and led by Elon Musk, can save the day.</p>
<p>Investment in a Doge Mecha NFT is more than a financial endeavor and is instead a commitment and pledge to fight against global tyranny. It’s also a community-focused project. The project intends to host multiple AMAs and liaise with several prominent influencers in the future.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/334308/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Doge Uprising token presale" /></figure>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising/">Doge Uprising</a> has undertaken a <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/SolidProof-Audit.pdf"><u>smart contract security audit from SolidProof</u></a>. No critical issues were found and the project contact was deemed safe to deploy. This is testimony to the levels of transparency associated with this PoS campaign, which is important given the volatility and lack of transparency often associated with such presales.</p>
<p>The price per token is $0.000013, but this will double in the next stage. That’s a 100% increase merely for buying the token early and holding onto it. So users can benefit from price appreciation and staking rewards. In addition, this staking project offers a commission program, where 10% of the referee’s investment is automatically sent to your wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/334309/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Doge Mecha from doge uprising" /></figure>
<p>ETH, USDT, and BNB can be used to purchase the token. Wallet Connect and MetaMask are required to connect to the presale listing page. There are a total of 450 billion $DUP tokens, of which 270 billion (60%) are available in the presale. 10% of the supply, 45 billion $DUP, is also allocated to airdrops. More info on the Doge Uprising presale can be obtained from the project <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Whitepaper</u></a>, as well as the social channels  &#8211; <a href="https://t.me/+JfnjZpCD9b4wNTlk"><u>Telegram</u></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Doge_Uprising"><u>Twitter</u></a>. </p>

<h3><strong>8. Ethereum &#8211; Most Popular Staking Crypto</strong></h3>
<p>One of the largest and most popular cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH), has recently transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoS) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Thus, it has the potential to become one of the best cryptocurrencies for staking in 2023. With the upgrade, Ethereum is expected to solve major network concerns related to high gas fees, scalability, and transaction speed, as well as cutting energy usage by 99.9%.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;re looking to earn a yield on your ETH holding then the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-yield-farming-crypto-platforms.htm">best yield farming crypto platforms</a> such as OKX can offer APYs over 5% on certain crypto crosses. Similarly, for those looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-interest-accounts.htm">best crypto interest accounts</a>, Crypto.com offers an interest rate of up to 6% for ETH.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222860/eth-coins.jpg" alt="Ethereum crypto coins" /></p>
<p>With the new upgrade, investors will be able to stake Ethereum to help secure the network and earn rewards in the process. However, there is a minimum staking requirement of 32 ETH. Seen as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoin</a> by many investors, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin with a market cap of $148 billion. ETH is currently trading near $1,620 &#8211; significantly below its all-time high of $4,900.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Cardano &#8211; Best Staking Token for High Transaction Speed</strong></h3>
<p>Created by one of the founders of Ethereum, Cardano is considered one of the best proof-of-stake blockchains in 2023. ADA, the native cryptocurrency, can be staked on the Cardano network to earn yearly interest in return for validating blocks on the blockchain. </p>
<p>On Cardano, new blocks are verified through nodes selection. When an individual joins a node, ADA is locked away in that node. After blocks are produced, the nodes earn rewards distributed among the individuals, also referred to as pool contributors. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222863/cardano-home.jpg" alt="Cardano blockchain homepage" /></p>
<p>Investors can also choose to stake their assets to stake pool operators &#8211; individuals who have specialized knowledge to perform the necessary tasks of maintaining the network. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">best proof of stake coins</a>, Cardano (ADA), can be staked on some of the popular crypto exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com, eToro, and Kraken exchange &#8211; of which eToro is the most regulated crypto platform.</p>
<p>With an average of 75,000 transactions per second (TPS), Cardano is one of the fastest networks in the blockchain space. After launching at $0.076 in 2017, ADA reached an ATH of $3.10 in 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Stake Cardano on eToro</a>
<p><i>Crypto assets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>10. Solana &#8211; Best Staking Token for Scalability</strong></h3>
<p>Solana is a decentralized blockchain built to support scalable and user-friendly apps worldwide. The network attracts various dApps (decentralized applications) and developers due to its high speed and low costs &#8211; supporting more than 50,000 TPS with an average transaction cost below $0.1. </p>
<p>A proof-of-stake coin, SOL can be easily delegated to network validators to earn a potentially high annual percentage yield (APY). SOL has an APY of $5.32%, making it one of the best staking cryptocurrencies for investors seeking to generate passive income.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222868/sol.jpg" alt="Solana layer 1 blockchain homepage" /></p>
<p>In 2021, SOL grew from a price of $1.5 in January to an ATH of $260 in May &#8211; a 17,233% price increase. However, SOL has suffered a brutal year &#8211; especially after the collapse of FTX &#8211; and is now trading at nearly $25.</p>

<h3><strong>11. Polygon &#8211; Super-Fast Layer-2 Staking Crypto</strong></h3>
<p>An open-sourced and permissionless blockchain, Polygon (MATIC) is built on the Ethereum network to offer high-scaling solutions. The native cryptocurrency, MATIC, is used to settle transactions, staked to secure the platform, and has rewarded investors with massive growth in the last few years.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222869/polygon-home.jpg" alt="Polygon layer 2 blockchain homepage" /></figure>
<p>With a total supply of 10 billion tokens, 12% of MATIC is allocated to fund staking rewards on the Polygon network. A PoS consensus, Polygon utilizes a sustainable and environmentally friendly network that does not require large amounts of computational power. </p>
<p>Anyone can become a network validator by staking MATIC, with the proportion of rewards depending on an individual’s stake. With over 100 global validators maintaining the network, a total of $2.36 billion is staked on the Polygon network. With nearly half a billion worth of rewards distributed from the staking pool, Polygon is one of the top staking coins in 2023.</p>

<h3><strong>12. Avalanche &#8211; Best Staking Coin for Network Validators</strong></h3>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible open-sourced platform that functions as a platform for various decentralized applications. One of Ethereum’s top rivals, Avalanche, is also smart contract compatible and offers higher throughput levels. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222871/screen-shot-2022-09-26-at-4-53-52-pm.jpg" alt="Avalanche blockchain homepage" /></figure>
<p>Avalanche is capable of handling 6,500 TPS, compared to Ethereum’s 17. AVAX, the native cryptocurrency, can be staked to earn potentially high annual yields. Currently, delegators can earn an average of 8.67% in yearly rewards by staking AVAX, while validators can earn up to 8.97%. </p>
<p>Delegators are individuals who choose to stake AVAX but give the responsibility of utilizing the staked tokens for network security to the validators.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>13. Binance Coin (BNB) &#8211; Best Staking Crypto for Binance Users</strong></h3>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of Binance &#8211; the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume. With Binance, investors can trade over 600 cryptocurrency assets. </p>
<p>On the exchange, traders access low spot trading fees of $0.1% per transaction. However, BNB token holders can get a 25% discount on this fee, depending on the size of their BNB holdings. Another way to benefit from BNB is through staking options. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222874/screen-shot-2022-09-26-at-4-55-35-pm.jpg" alt="Binance exchange homepage" /></figure>
<p>The amount BNB investors earn via staking differs depending on the lock-up periods and the amount of tokens staked. For example, investors staking $5,000 worth of BNB for 120 days can earn up to 12.99% APY. Thus, BNB is potentially one of the best staking cryptocurrency options in 2023.</p>
<p>Trading under $1 in 2017, BNB eventually reached an ATH of $690 in 2021. However, the token has declined significantly throughout 2022. Currently, BNB trades at $312 per token, with a market cap of nearly $50 billion. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy BNB on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>14. Polkadot &#8211; Best Staking Crypto for Cross-Chain Use</strong></h3>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) is a popular protocol enabling cross-chain blockchain transfers of tokens, data and any other type of asset. Polkadot aims to provide a decentralized web that its users can control. Therefore, the blockchain offers staking options for various network operations and maintaining security on the network. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222876/polkadot-apr.jpg" alt="Polkadot staking rewards" /></figure>
<p>With a circulating supply of over 1.1 billion DOT, 52% of the available tokens have been staked. One of the major reasons for this is the high annual yields that the network provides. Platform delegators earn an average APR of 14.02% while running validator nodes attracts an APR of 14.83%.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy Polkadot on eToro</a>

<h3><strong>15. Tezos &#8211; Best Web3 Staking Network</strong></h3>
<p>Tezos is an open-source and smart contract-compatible platform designed to power the Web3 revolution. With Tezos, you can access a high-speed decentralized network where users can directly interface and communicate with each other. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222878/tezos-1.jpg" alt="Tezos staking homepage" /></figure>
<p>A key platform component is user-driven governance, an important element of the Web3 revolution. The network offers this by allowing users to participate, evaluate, and maintain the site actively. One of the ways of governing the platform is by staking XTZ &#8211; the native cryptocurrency of Tezos. </p>
<p>Requiring less energy than Ethereum and Bitcoin to operate, Tezos leverages XTZ to offer a highly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-sustainable-cryptocurrency.htm">sustainable cryptocurrency</a> platform. Currently, delegators can earn an APR of 5.34% by staking XTZ. The platform also has a high staking ratio of 74% &#8211; meaning that holders have staked nearly 3 out of 4 XTZ tokens. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy Tezos on eToro</a>

<h3><strong>16. Algorand &#8211; Best Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) Staking Protocol</strong></h3>
<p>Algorand is a decentralized blockchain network operating on a unique consensus known as the Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS). Built on the Byzantine consensus, Algorand’s network maintains itself via staking operations. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222880/algo-supply.jpg" alt="Algorand total ALGO supply" /></figure>
<p>With PPoS, users who stake ALGO are randomly selected to propose new blocks and vote on block proposals. Notably, a user&#8217;s influence is directly proportional to the amount of ALGO they stake on the network. Therefore, users with the highest levels of staked assets have a significantly larger chance of contributing to the network. </p>
<p>Currently, ALGO delegators can expect an APR of 7.75%. Nearly 3.65 billion of the available 7.34 billion ALGO tokens are currently staked.</p>

<h2><strong>What are Crypto Staking Coins?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrency staking is a process supported with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) digital assets. Crypto staking involves locking up a portion of your token holdings for a certain period to take advantage of certain benefits or rewards.</p>
<h3><strong>How Do Staking Tokens Work?</strong></h3>
<p>For example, staking rewards in cryptocurrency works similarly to earning interest in your savings account. After staking a portion of your assets, investors can earn interest on their holdings. With fiat currency, the bank typically uses this staked amount from your savings account to provide loans to other customers. </p>
<p>However, in cryptocurrencies, the staked assets are used to maintain and validate each new block &#8211; which is a cryptographic representation of a new transaction on the platform. </p>
<p>For instance, here is an example of how crypto staking works:</p>
<ul>
<li>An investor wishes to stake Cardano (ADA) to earn interest.</li>
<li>The investor stakes $1,000 worth of ADA for 3 months. </li>
<li>The staked ADA is used to secure the network. </li>
<li>The investor earns 5% interest at the end of the 3 months, receiving $1,050 in total. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Is Staking Cryptocurrency Worth it?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before investing in some of the assets from our staking coins list, it is important for investors and traders to review the benefits of staking coins. The sections below review if staking cryptocurrencies is a worthwhile investment. </p>
<h3><strong>Earn Passive Income </strong></h3>
<p>Firstly, generating passive income is the biggest benefit of staking cryptocurrencies. While the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-work-coins.htm">best proof-of-work</a> coins like Bitcoin have a significantly high market cap, proof-of-stake tokens can be leveraged to earn additional income. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222882/polkadot-returns.jpg" alt="Polkadot staking rewards calculator" /></figure>
<p>For example, investors can stake their preferred tokens to earn an APY &#8211; annual percentage yield. Like a savings account, you generate fixed income yearly from your holdings. This is a great opportunity for investors looking to hold tokens for the long term. With certain tokens such as Polkadot (DOT), investors can earn returns as high as 14% annually. </p>
<h3><strong>Contribute to Network Security </strong></h3>
<p>Apart from investment opportunities, many users see cryptocurrencies as a new and revolutionary method of making currency completely decentralized. Thus, many networks promote community participation via token governance. Staking tokens allow investors to participate as network validators &#8211; validating nodes and creating new blocks on the blockchain. Furthermore, network validators earn higher rewards than delegators. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Pick the Best Staking Cryptocurrency</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The steps below discuss a few methods of assessing the best staking cryptocurrencies to invest in: </p>
<h3><strong>High APY</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best ways of picking the top staking cryptos is by analyzing the Annual Percentage Yield. For example, investors will likely stake their cryptocurrencies with a network providing higher returns. With Polkadot, delegators can earn up to 14.84% return on their staked assets. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 11.8% annually since its inception in 1957. </p>
<h3><strong>Lock-Up Time</strong></h3>
<p>Many cryptocurrencies offer flexible lock-up periods &#8211; allowing investors to stop staking their assets at any moment. On the other hand, fixed lock-up periods are likely to attract a higher rate of return. However, investors looking to stake for short intervals may benefit from choosing digital assets that offer flexible options. For example, Cardano (ADA) allows investors lock up their assets for a minimum of 30 days on Binance. </p>
<h2><strong>Where to Stake Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We recommend <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> for beginners as the safest and best cryptocurrency staking exchange in 2023. eToro is a global multi-asset trading platform with over 27 million users. A secure exchange, eToro is regulated by top-tier global bodies, including the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), and the ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88750/222883/etoro-crypto.jpg" alt="eToro crypto daily movers" /></figure>
<p>Offering over 60 tradable cryptocurrencies, investors can trade all of the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies in our list. eToro supports staking in namely 3 crypto assets &#8211; Ethereum, Cardano, and Tron. The yields investors receive depend on their eToro membership card tiers.</p>
<p>For example, the Bronze card members are eligible to earn 75% of the monthly staking yield on Cardano (ADA), while the Silver/Gold card members can earn 85%. The Diamond/ Platinum card members receive the highest benefits, as they are eligible to earn 95% of the monthly staking yield on Cardano. </p>
<p>An efficient and easy-to-use platform, eToro requires investors to complete a 5-minute KYC (Know Your Customer) process before accessing their account. </p>
<p>eToro charges 1% per crypto transaction, which is added to the bid/ask spread price. After making a minimum deposit of $10 (for US and UK customers only), investors can begin trading digital assets at a low cost. Investors can deposit via fiat currency payment methods such as credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets like PayPal, Skrill, and Neteller. </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<h2><b>What is Bitcoin ETF Token? </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) is a new ERC-20 token that speculates on the upcoming Bitcoin ETF release and offers staking yields to $BTCETF token holders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1440" height="487" class="aligncenter wp-image-127994" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360300-bitcoin-etf-home-image.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token crypto project" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360300-bitcoin-etf-home-image.png 1440w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360300-bitcoin-etf-home-image-300x101.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360300-bitcoin-etf-home-image-1024x346.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360300-bitcoin-etf-home-image-768x260.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /></p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) will allow traders to buy and sell Bitcoin without holding the underlying asset. At the moment, the SEC is yet to confirm the release of such an ETF in the U.S. By visiting the Bitcoin ETF Token website, users can get regular updates and all the latest information on the Bitcoin ETF progress.</p>
<p>A deflationary cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 25% of its token supply over time. The platform will conduct burning events upon achieving 5 different milestones &#8211; each linked to real-time Bitcoin and ETF updates. Here are the milestones Bitcoin ETF Token has set:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1210" height="417" class="aligncenter wp-image-127995" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token milestones" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones.png 1210w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones-300x103.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones-1024x353.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360339-bitcoin-etf-milestones-768x265.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1210px) 100vw, 1210px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>$BTCETF to cross a trading volume of $100 million</li>
<li>SEC to approve the first Bitcoin ETF</li>
<li>The official release of the Bitcoin ETF</li>
<li>The Bitcoin ETF surpassing $1 billion worth of assets under management</li>
<li>$BTC to trade over the $100K mark</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, as each milestone is reached, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 5% of its total 2.1 billion supply. A deflationary token supply makes the asset <a href="https://ir.nmu.org.ua/handle/123456789/163543">attractive to investors seeking long-term value storage opportunities</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin ETF Token also charges a 5% burning tax on all transactions. The tax will reduce by 1% as each milestone is met. Read the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token whitepaper</a> to learn more about this cryptocurrency.</p>

<h3><b>Bitcoin ETF Token Staking Utility </b></h3>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token offers attractive rewards to long-term token holders. The platform allows $BTCETF token holders to lock their holdings in a smart contract &#8211; which is <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf">verified by Coinsult</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135716" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740732-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-20-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token staking" width="900" height="296" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740732-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-20-pm.png 1335w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740732-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-20-pm-300x99.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740732-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-20-pm-1024x337.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740732-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-20-pm-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This cryptocurrency will eventually launch a staking pool, where your rewards will depend on the number of tokens in the pool, and the average annual returns percentage. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">best staking coins</a>, Bitcoin ETF Token is offering a live APY (Annual Percentage Yield) of 177%.</p>
<p>Currently, more than 150 million tokens have already been locked on the staking contract. As more investors buy and stake $BTCETF during the ongoing presale, the annual yield will decrease.</p>
<h2><b>BTC Token and Long-Term Volatility </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2007, Bitcoin became the first cryptocurrency to be launched. This proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism was created by a person who goes by the alias ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’.</p>
<p>More than 15 years later, Bitcoin has become one of the largest assets in the financial space, boasting a market cap of $670 billion. However, trading BTC could be a very risky investment for hedge funds and institutional investors. This is due to the high levels of volatility that surround the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="828" height="648" class="aligncenter wp-image-127997" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360412-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-5-45-36-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin price chart" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360412-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-5-45-36-pm.png 828w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360412-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-5-45-36-pm-300x235.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360412-screen-shot-2023-11-07-at-5-45-36-pm-768x601.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></p>
<p>For instance, Bitcoin traded at a high of over $70,000 towards the end of 2020. Since then, the crypto plunged to below the $20,000 zone in 2022. Since these price increases and corrections are a constant for even the largest crypto in the world &#8211; a Bitcoin ETF could be the answer to such volatility.</p>
<h2><b>Bitcoin ETF Token and the Rise of Bitcoin ETFs </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin ETFs offer a more accessible and regulated way of gaining exposure to Bitcoin. The theory is that spot Bitcoin ETFs can help enhance liquidity, and provide more stabilized price movements of the cryptocurrency asset.</p>
<p>In fact, Bitcoin Futures ETFs give investors trading access to Bitcoin, without the need to hold the underlying asset. While many institutional investors fear the unregulated nature of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin ETF would need approval from the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), before going public.</p>
<p>At the moment, the SEC has to give their verdict on nearly ten filings of potential Bitcoin ETFs. They have until 10th January 2024, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sec-has-8-10-filings-possible-bitcoin-etf-products-gensler-2023-10-26/#:~:text=The%20240%2Dday%20SEC%20comment,approve%20it%20by%20that%20date.">to either reject or approve the ETFs</a>. A successful approval would make pension funds and hedge funds more open to the idea of trading Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In fact, large global investment corporations including BlackRock are backing the idea of a Bitcoin ETF. By linking its project milestones and token-burning events to real-time Bitcoin and spot Bitcoin updates, Bitcoin ETF Token offers rewards to investors through the $BTCETF token.</p>
<p>By joining the Bitcoin ETF Token ecosystem, investors can join a movement that wants to celebrate the imminent launch of Bitcoin ETFs. Simultaneously, this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> can be staked on a smart contract to earn huge staking yields.</p>
<h2><b>Bitcoin ETF Token Tokenomics &amp; Presale </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Currently, investors can buy $BTCETF from the ongoing presale. From a total supply of 2.1 billion tokens &#8211; 40% (840 million) have been allocated for the presale.</p>
<p>The presale consists of ten rounds &#8211; each allocating 84 million tokens. At the time of writing, $BTCETF is priced at $0.0056 per token. By the tenth and final presale round, the price will increase to $0.0068 per token. Thus, interested investors can buy $BTCETF at the earlier stages, before the price goes up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135713" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740683-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-05-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" width="900" height="418" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740683-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-05-pm.png 1315w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740683-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-05-pm-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740683-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-05-pm-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740683-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-05-pm-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700740683-screen-shot-2023-11-23-at-5-09-05-pm-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Another 25% of the token supply is being offered as staking rewards. These rewards will be distributed to staked token holders over a period of 5 years. Another 10% of the token supply will be used to provide liquidity.</p>
<p>The remaining 25% of the supply will be burned over time &#8211; taking the maximum supply to just 1.575 billion tokens. Since the presale started just over two weeks ago, Bitcoin ETF Token has raised more than $1.4 million. The presale hard cap target is set at nearly $5 million.</p>
<p>Due to the deflationary tokenomics and the high staking yields, $BTCETF can undergo one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> in 2023.</p>
<h2><b>Bitcoin ETF Token: A Look Ahead </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin ETF Token has created a detailed roadmap to highlight some of its future objectives and goals. Let’s take a look at what lies ahead for $BTCETF:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1217" height="606" class="aligncenter wp-image-127999" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360492-bitcoin-etf-roadmap.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token roadmap" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360492-bitcoin-etf-roadmap.png 1217w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360492-bitcoin-etf-roadmap-300x149.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360492-bitcoin-etf-roadmap-1024x510.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360492-bitcoin-etf-roadmap-768x382.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699360492-bitcoin-etf-roadmap-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1217px) 100vw, 1217px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Stage 1: Presale &#8211;</b> The short-term goal for Bitcoin ETF Token is to conduct a successful presale. This will help foster a loyal community of investors since a majority of the token supply is being available for low prices.</li>
<li><b>Stage 2: Pre-Launch &#8211;</b> The project will start marketing its cryptocurrency, and raise awareness for the importance of needing Bitcoin ETFs.</li>
<li><b>Stage 3: BTCETF DEX Launch &#8211;</b> After the presale, $BTCETF will be launched on decentralized exchanges. The 5% burning tax will also be activated. Once the milestones are achieved, the tax will start reducing by 1%, and 5% of the supply will be burned.</li>
<li><b>Stage 4: 25% Token Supply Burn &#8211;</b> The main long-term goal is burning 25% of the token supply. This will occur as Bitcoin ETF Token achieves all of its milestones.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Should you Buy Bitcoin ETF Token During the Presale</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Before making an investment, it is important to know the benefits of the particular cryptocurrency. The sections below discuss why investors may choose to buy $BTCETF during the presale:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Early Entry Level &#8211;</b> At press time, $BTCETF is priced at only $0.0056 per token during the ongoing presale round. Not only is this an affordable investment, but investors can also buy the token before the price increases across the other nine stages.</li>
<li><b>Deflationary Asset &#8211;</b> One of the main features of $BTCETF is that it is a deflationary asset. In the long term, 25% of the token supply will be burned. This could be a valuable investment to hold since the reduced circulating supply can make the $BTCETF price more competitive.</li>
<li><b>Passive Income &#8211;</b> Through the verified Ethereum smart contract, $BTCETF token holders can stake tokens and receive high APYs. The staking pool will allocate 25% of the $BTCETF token supply over the next 5 years. At press time, Bitcoin ETF Token offers an annual staking yield of 177%.</li>
<li><b>Referral Bonus &#8211;</b> After purchasing $BTCETF during the presale, investors can access a unique referral link. For every purchase made using the particular link, you are rewarded 5% of the purchase as a reward for bringing forth new investors.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Bitcoin ETF Token Price Prediction &#8211; What is $BTCETF’s Price Potential? </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Offering a deflationary mechanism and high staking rewards, Bitcoin ETF Token is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">best future crypto</a> projects to invest in right now.</p>
<p>Currently, we are still in the early stages of the presale. However, the token is off to a promising start &#8211; raising more than $35K in one day. The short-term target is to meet the presale hard cap of $4.965 million. After the presale, we could potentially expect a huge price increase after the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) listing.</p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As is common with many cryptos, the price tends to soar right after the exchange listing. A listing on one of the top exchanges can help increase the trading volume as well. In the future, as Bitcoin ETF Token starts achieving its milestones such as the $100 million trading volume &#8211; the reduced token supply can provide another push in the token price. Finally, for long-term growth, features such as the staking mechanism can help secure a loyal customer base.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we believe that $BTCETF has the potential to soar by 5x &#8211; 10x after the exchange listing. However, we cannot guarantee a price jump due to the volatile nature of these assets.

<h2><strong>Best Crypto for Long Term Investments: Reviewed</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The sections below discuss some of the top cryptocurrencies by looking at their current prices, use-cases and price predictions for the future. Here are some of the best crypto for long term growth.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Best Long Term Crypto With A Deflationary Model And Dynamic Token Burns</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is gaining attention in the crypto world, especially as it&#8217;s linked to the developments of the Bitcoin Spot ETF, a highly anticipated pending approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>$BTCETF is currently in its presale phase, which is divided into ten stages. Starting at $0.005 per token, the price is set to increase to $0.0068 by the final round. </p>
<p>This structure offers an immediate upside for early investors, making it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on price increases. The presale has already shown strong market trust, nearing $700K in under 10 days of launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token whitepaper</a>, one of the key features of Bitcoin ETF Token is its deflationary model. The total supply is fixed at 2.1 billion tokens, with a significant portion (up to 25%) set to be removed from circulation through systematic burning. </p>
<p>This burning is triggered by major milestones related to the Bitcoin ETF market, such as reaching $100 million in trading volume, the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, and Bitcoin surpassing $100K in value.</p>
<p>A standout feature for investors is the high staking yield offered by $BTCETF. At press time, the annual staking yield is over 300%, a rate expected to decrease as more tokens are staked, and more investors join. </p>
<p>Over 75 million tokens have already been locked in staking smart contracts, showing investor confidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>After connecting a compatible crypto wallet, investors interested in $BTCETF can buy the token using Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT). </p>
<p>The project has also been audited by Coinsult, which found no major issues, adding an extra layer of security for potential investors.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Long Term Crypto Offers High APYs With World First Stake To Earn Design</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</u></a> is targeting the billion dollar Bitcoin cloud mining industry and offers a completely new paradigm in terms of how it works and how it benefits investors.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/333341/bitcoin-minetrix-img.jpg" alt="bitcoin minetrix stake-to-mine project" /></figure>
<p>Through this ecosystem, users simply stake their BTCMTX tokens, which generate BTC cloud mining credits, which are burned in return for Bitcoin. This is done through non-transferrable ERC20 tokens, and the staker retains full control over the assets, with a tiny upfront investment of just $10.</p>
<p>This is not the case at all with Bitcoin mining or even Bitcoin cloud mining, which are slightly separate industries. Bitcoin mining refers to the mining of BTC using expensive ASIC hardware, with high electricity costs. Bitcoin cloud mining allows users to take part in this process without purchasing the hardware.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this industry is known for high levels of dishonesty and high entry costs. The users do not retain control over anything, and have to hope that the cloud mining company will make good on its promises.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is the only provider that offers its unique stake-to-mine where users retain all control, while still benefiting from Bitcoin mining. This is done in an eco-friendly manner, the campaign being powered over Ethereum, which is much more sustainable than Bitcoin.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Users will also benefit from high yields as well as a lower presale price. In stage one, the token price is $0.0113, and this will rise within each progressive stage. Users also have the option to decide if they want to stake their coins or burn for BTC, dual means of income generation.</p>
<p>This is a coin that could 10x or even 100x, according to some analysts. It offers high yields, multiple means of income, and targets a real world billion dollar industry that people would like access to, but do not have the expertise or money to gain entry. This is where Bitcoin Minetrix comes in.</p>
<p>Investors should consider reading the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Whitepaper</u></a> for a balanced understanding of this long term crypto asset.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix?s=21"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix"><u>Telegram</u></a> are also useful for alerts and updates. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Offers Meme vs Meme Combat With Steady 112% APY And Fight Betting Options</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat"><u>Meme Kombat ($MK)</u></a> is an exciting new presale and the first-ever campaign to capture the world’s most famous memes and put them together for combat &#8211; with multiple betting options on the outcome. This includes the world’s most famous meme tokens, such as Shiba, Doge, Floki, Pepe, etc. The presale has raised over $1 million so far. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/332786/screen-shot-2023-10-05-at.jpg" alt="meme kombat crypto staking project" /></figure>
<p>The fights are selected at random with the help of artificial intelligence, and the outcomes are processed automatically with blockchain technology. This helps in terms of project transparency. Most notably, however, is the fact that the presale founder, Matt Whiteman, has been doxxed.</p>
<p>This means he has publicly unveiled his identity, and you can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattw8047814774/"><u>view his status on LinkedIn</u></a>. This is not at all common within the presale industry. Combined with the fact that this token has conducted a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cmzG-n6ziqdjBfYU7DoRdSHzcxWXImk/view"><u>smart contract audit</u></a>, it is one of the most transparent we have ever seen.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/332787/screen-shot-2023-10-05-at.jpg" alt="earn apy when staking $MK" /></figure>
<p>And it also offers many ways to generate ROI for investors. Users can benefit from a steady 112% APY, or bet on the fight outcome. There are three primary betting options &#8211; P v P, P v Game, and Direct. But this ecosystem also allows for side bets on very exotic and niche events, to further improve on the user experience.</p>
<p>The graphics are enhanced through cutting-edge AI rendering for life-like depictions, though the campaign sticks to the characteristics and tendencies of the original meme icons. More memes and game styles are to be added when season one concludes.</p>
<p>There are a total of 120 million MK tokens, and 50% are being made available in the presale, with 30% to staking, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to player rewards. Nothing has been withheld for the founders.</p>
<p><iframe title="&#x1f525; Meme Kombat Unleashes Fury in Record-Breaking Presale Phase! &#x1f4b0; Almost $900,000 Raised" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ge2aCCVj0VA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a coin with extremely high potential and it combines the appeal of the world&#8217;s most powerful memes under one unified architecture, with wagering on the fight outcomes.</p>
<p>Priced at just $0.1667, it could be a top long-term crypto investment, and the meme industry is known to yield enormous profits, if market conditions are right.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Hot New Community-Driven Meme Crypto With Over a Million Followers, Raised Over $25 Million In Finished Presale</strong></h3>
<p> The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> (WSM) coin is a trending new meme crypto developed by the creators of the popular Ethereum NFT collection, Wall St Bulls. This presale is finished, with a token live on OKX, and has been performing incredibly well price wise. </p>
<p>This successful NFT collection gave its community unique perks like an Options Market and a priority list for other NFT collections and sold out within 30 minutes of launch on Ethereum.</p>
<p>The $WSM token presale was launched in May 2023, leveraging their established reputation and a community of over a million followers across social media.</p>
<p>With over $300,000 raised on day one, the project saw a strong start, highlighting solid community support. A few months into its launch, the presale has an uptick in investor interest, having collected over $25 million. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/326433/wsm-over-25m-sold.jpg" alt="WSM crypto meme project" /></figure>
<p>Presale tokens are priced at a presale rate of $0.0337 USDT, offering an upside opportunity for early buyers. </p>
<p>However, investors must note that although presale investments can provide substantial returns, they also come with potential risks. But coins with strong community backing often perform well over the long term.</p>
<p>Importantly, influential figures like Elon Musk have engaged with the platform&#8217;s memes, highlighting its broad reach and popularity. The project&#8217;s substantial community involvement may help the $WSM get listed on major exchanges.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/277446/screenshot-2023-05-26-at-.jpg" alt="$WSM tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>As per the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes whitepaper</u></a>, the $WSM token&#8217;s total supply is capped at 2 billion tokens, and all of it is dedicated to community allocation. Half of these tokens are reserved for the presale, while the rest is split between community rewards and liquidity.</p>
<p>Additionally, an airdrop is scheduled to celebrate the launch. Token holders who follow the project on social media channels and join the platform’s Discord can win part of a $50k pool.</p>

<h3><strong>7. eTukTuk &#8211; Newly Launched Community Sale To Launch a Green Revolution and Sustainable Future For Everyone</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/eTukTuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> aims to assist TukTuk drivers from less developed countries to start using more sustainable practices by transitioning to EV vehicles. A TukTuk is a form of 3-wheeled taxi often seen in Asia, and is also known as an auto rickshaw. </p>
<p>Currently, ICEs (Internal Combustion Engines) are used to run most TukTuks and these release much more CO2 into the air than cars. So eTukTuk will be creating EV charging stations and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to promote the switch to using zero-emission vehicles and help the environment. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/322626/screen-shot-2023-08-08-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk green evolution crypto presale" /></figure>
<p>The eTukTuk project is based out of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, and eTukTuk will be building these charging stations in the urban and suburban regions of various developing nations. For convenience, drivers will be able to make purchases on the application using $TUK tokens.</p>
<p>A percentage of the transactions generated will be sent to partners within a given territory,  who are responsible for the manufacturing and setting up the EVSE/EV charging stations. According to the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf">eTukTuk whitepaper</a>, token holders can also stake the token to earn benefits</p>
<p>An APY (Annual Percentage Yield) will be provided every time a driver makes a payment on the app. From a staking pool, the funds will be distributed to the staked token holders.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/322627/screen-shot-2023-08-08-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk project overview" /></figure>
<p>$TUK has a total supply of 2 billion tokens. The current price per token is 1 $TUK Token = $0.024 and there is no cliff or vesting period. In the next stage, the price will rise to $0.028. The project has been audited by Certik and the community sale hard cap is $120,000. </p>
<p>To take part in the community sale a wallet such as MetaMask, Wallet Connect, or Trust Wallet is a prerequisite. </p>
<p>You can find out more about the project by looking at the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf">whitepaper</a> or by checking out the <a href="https://twitter.com/TukToken">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk">Telegram</a> channels.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Scorpion Casino &#8211; Offers up to $10,000 in Daily PoS Staking Rewards, Redefines Online Casino Industry</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/scorpion-casino"><u>Scorpion Casino (SCORP)</u></a> is a new initiative that offers a potential $10,000 in daily staking rewards, and a new model of casino. This presale has raised a nice $1.2 million and allows all players to benefit from a new casino variant, not just a small group of owners. </p>
<p>This is a licensed and regulated casino provider that refers to itself as the future of online gambling. The Scorpion core team has been verified by Assure DeFi. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/332811/screen-shot-2023-10-05-at.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino token presale" /></figure>
<p>Scorpion Casino is a fully fledged casino that provides 30,000 betting opportunities, 210 casino games, over 35 different sports, and 160 live games. It offers all the power of traditional online casinos, but is structured in a much more equitable manner.</p>
<p>Scorpion Casino incorporates a buy back model, using a portion of its profit to buy back the native $SCORP token. This results in price appreciation of the native token, which is held by casino owners. Plus, The smart contract automatically burns half of the purchased $SCORP tokens each day. This process reduces the circulating $SCORP supply, which makes the remaining tokens more valuable.</p>
<p>The other half of the tokens obtained through the buyback process will be automatically transferred to the Scorpion Staking Pool. This staking pool then distributes rewards daily to $SCORP holders based on the number of tokens they hold, generating daily profits for them.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/332812/screen-shot-2023-10-05-at.jpg" alt="TG.Casino main features" /></figure>
<p>Currently, the BEP20 token is priced at just $0.018, about 33% of the final listing price of $0.05. This is a strong incentive for investment. Presale investors can also benefit from 40% in credits to play, as an additional bonus. Tokens can be purchased using a compatible Web3 wallet, paid in USDT, BNB, or ETH.</p>

<h3><strong>11. The Uncharted  &#8211; An NFT Project Powered by Xeta and Successful High-Frequency Trading</strong></h3>
<p>Most NFT projects, when it comes to long-term rewards, focus on the value of the NFT itself. This can be a bit of a hit-and-miss, as it is hard to gauge whether there will still be interest in the appearance or exclusivity. Instead, projects should focus on novel ways of offering value, and <a href="https://theuncharted.space/?utm_source=CryptoPR"><u>The Uncharted</u></a> exemplifies that.</p>
<p>The Uncharted NFT collection is a set of 21,000 NFTs that help bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance. The team, all of whom have been doxxed, is keen on making this project more than a collection of pictures. As such, it has created a platform powered by Xeta where NFT holders earn from a 36-month investment pool.</p>

<p>All sales revenue from the NFT goes towards the XETA Capital Fund (XCF) High-Frequency Trading fund, which is a highly proven fund. This has a strong track record of success, and holders stand a chance to gain as much as 400% annually. What’s more, there is quarterly profit distribution to holders via an airdrop. While there is a 36-month investment period, users can opt to sell their NFTs at any time on OpenSea. After the “3-year adventure into deep space”, the fund is split evenly between the NFT holders and The Uncharted LTD.</p>
<p>The Uncharted NFT collection is set to launch in Q1 2023, with the first chapter focusing on “The Southern Ring Nebula.” Most chapters will follow in the months to come, and they are currently under development. The themes of the collection are focused on adventure, survival, and discovery.</p>

<p>The Uncharted offers users a new way to earn from their NFTs, and in a field where you normally would have to be a high net worth individual with several millions of dollars in liquidity.</p>

<h3><strong>13. Ethereum &#8211; Promising Crypto to HODL in 2023</strong></h3>
<p>With a market cap of $213 billion, Ethereum (ETH) is one of the best crypto for hodling in 2023. An open-sourced network, Ethereum leverages smart contracts to allow developers to list various DApps (decentralized applications), NFTs, and other protocols. According to algorithmic Ethereum <a href="https://coincodex.com/crypto/ethereum/price-prediction/">price prediction by CoinCodex</a>, Ethereum is expected to reach nearly $3,000 by the end of 2023.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/242630/ethereum-long-term-price-prediction-by-coincodex.jpg" alt="ETH price chart from CoinCodex" /></figure>
<p>After reaching an ATH of $4,900 in November 2021, ETH is trading at $1,740 in September 2022 &#8211; which equates to a 64% price correction. Despite this, Ethereum has the potential to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm"><u>best altcoins to buy</u></a> right now. </p>
<p>The network is expected to undergo a major upgrade &#8211; named The Merge &#8211; which will solve major scalability issues on the cryptocurrency. That landmark upgrade is expected on September 19. </p>
<p>Ethereum is also expected to reduce transaction costs and energy efficiency issues as well increase speed with the release of the much-awaited ‘ETH 2.0’ upgrade. This could therefore make it the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-energy-efficient-cryptocurrency.htm">most energy-efficient crypto</a> to buy in 2023.

<h3><strong>14. Polygon &#8211; Innovative Crypto for Long-Term Growth</strong></h3>
<p>MATIC (Polygon) is one of the best crypto to hold long term. This cryptocurrency is an open source, permissionless platform deployed on Ethereum to act as a scalability solution. </p>
<p>MATIC makes Ethereum and other cryptocurrency networks more scalable by leveraging Optimistc Rollups &#8211; Layer 2 protocols. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/219888/polygon-price-chart.jpg" alt="Polygon price chart" /></figure>
<p>MATIC, the native crypto, plays an important role in governing the on-chain transactions and settling transactions between the different parties. The token soared from $0.0035 in 2019 to an ATH of $2.92 in 2021. </p>
<p>MATIC is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm"><u>best penny cryptocurrencies for 2022</u></a> and is currently trading at $0.99 per token having just announced a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/starbucks-odyssey-makes-big-bet-that-web3-nfts-can-make-rewards-immersive.htm">major partnership with coffeehouse Starbucks</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>15. Decentraland &#8211; Popular Metaverse Coin to Invest in</strong></h3>
<p>Decentraland is a virtual real estate platform where players can buy, sell and trade virtual plots of land. Each parcel of land is virtually minted as an NFT by using ERC-721 smart contracts. Investors must use MANA as the native cryptocurrency to trade these virtual plots &#8211; an ERC-20 token. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/219889/decentraland-sep-price.jpg" alt="MANA price chart" /></figure>
<p>MANA tokens can also be used within the ecosystem to purchase various in-game avatars, wearables and other items on the Decentraland marketplace. Besides in-game transactions, MANA is the governance token used to interact and participate in the Decentraland Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). </p>
<p>MANA became one of the most popular metaverse cryptos in 2021, as it increased from $0.08 to $3.2 by the end of the year &#8211; equating to a 3,900% price increase. However, MANA has declined in 2022 to $0.8 per token. The cryptocurrency is still the 39th largest digital asset, with a market cap of $1.5 billion.</p>

<h3><strong>16. Bitcoin &#8211; Largest Cryptocurrency to HODL for the Long-Term</strong></h3>
<p>Launched in 2008, Bitcoin (BTC) is the first-ever cryptocurrency that was invented. With a market cap of more than $427 billion, Bitcoin still accounts for 40% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap in the space. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/219890/btc-2022-price-chart.jpg" alt="BTC price chart" /></figure>
<p>After reaching an ATH of nearly $70,000 in 2021, Bitcoin declined in 2022 following uncertain economic conditions due to inflation and price hikes. Currently, BTC is trading at $22,000 in September 2022- more than a 50% decline since the start of the year. Some market analysts have offered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a> for 2025 and 2030 in which they forecast that BTC could hit highs of $65k again.  </p>
<p>However, BTC is known to face regular price volatility, with regular price corrections following bull markets. Since the token has regularly provided profits in the last decade, Bitcoin can be one of the best crypto for HODLing in 2023. </p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>17. Solana &#8211; Crypto with Fast Transaction Speed</strong></h3>
<p>Solana (SOL) is an open-sourced blockchain that provides decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions to users. The blockchain provides dApps creation by leveraging smart contracts, similar to Ethereum. </p>
<p>But unlike the popular cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL) offers higher scalability through its proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/219891/sol-coin-price-chart.jpg" alt="SOL price chart" /></figure>
<p>Solana can handle up to 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) at an average cost of just $0.00025 per transaction. SOL, the native token, burst onto the scene after soaring from a price of $1.8 in January 2021 to an ATH of $260 in November. </p>
<p>The token has since corrected to $30 in August 2022, making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/12-most-volatile-cryptos-trade-invest-2022.htm">most volatile cryptos</a>, but SOL seems to be gaining momentum in September, as the token has increased to $38 and boasts a market cap of $13.3 billion. </p>

<h3><strong>18. XRP &#8211; Instant Cross-Border Payment Settlement System</strong></h3>
<p>XRP is the native crypto on the XRP ledger blockchain, which hundreds of banks and financial institutions use as a cross-bored payment settlement system. </p>
<p>Institutions benefit from XRP’s truly decentralized and low-cost design &#8211; making it fast and affordable to make payments globally. The XRP ledger can handle 1,5000 TPS, with a mere $0.0002 transaction cost. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/219892/xrp-sep-price.jpg" alt="XRP price chart" /></figure>
<p>A sustainable blockchain, the XRP ledger is 61,000x more energy efficient than any other proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. After reaching an ATH of $3.84 in 2018, XRP has corrected to $0.35 per token in 2022. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, XRP has still provided a return on investment (ROI) of 5,965% since its launch. </p>

<h2><strong>How to Analyze Long Term Crypto Investments </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When looking for the best crypto to invest in the long term, investors should take a detailed look at the features and use cases provided by the respective assets. </p>
<p>The sections below discuss a few factors that may help determine potential long-term crypto investments. </p>
<h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Firstly, investors should study the various cryptocurrencies by looking at the use cases they provide in the market. For example, Bitcoin grew to popularity since it provided an alternative to centralized finance by offering peer-to-peer payments across the globe. </p>
<p>Similarly, Ethereum leveraged the proof-of-stake (PoS) and implemented smart contracts to allow developers to build new decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>Even if a token witnesses short-term price corrections, an abundance of use cases will help it outperform the market in the long term. </p>
<h3><strong>Growth Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Even the best shitcoins in the market, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, have faced high levels of volatility due to their limited growth potential. One of the reasons for this is due to their inflationary tokenomics.</p>
<p>For example, Dogecoin has increased its token supply from 100 billion to 132 billion tokens since launch &#8211; and has an ever-increasing supply &#8211; which limits the growth potential since supply outweighs demand. On the other hand, tokens like Tamadoge (TAMA) offer deflationary tokenomics. With a total token supply of 2 billion, TAMA will burn 5% of all tokens spent on the ecosystem. </p>
<p>D2T features a small supply of just 1 billion which could quickly lead to supply shock.</p>
<p>Thus, investors can invest in a coin that will be low in supply and potentially increase in price in the long term. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Make an Investment Decision on Long-Term Cryptos </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The best long term crypto portfolio may experience potential profits depending on when investors enter the market and how they analyze their investments. </p>
<p>Many beginner traders wondering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-into-crypto.htm">how to get into crypto</a> for the first time often look for the best long-term crypto investments. Here are a few factors that may help investors decide on whether to HODL or sell a cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3><strong>Performance in a Bear Market</strong></h3>
<p>In 2022, crypto markets have been trading downwards due to uncertain global market conditions. Typically, many investors compare the performance of altcoins to Bitcoin while trying to analyze if a token is a good investment. </p>
<p>For example, Bitcoin has fallen by more than 60% in 2022, just like most of the top digital assets. Therefore, the strong performance despite Bitcoin’s bearishness may be a sign of a solid long-term investment. </p>
<h3><strong>Prior All-Time Highs</strong></h3>
<p>While a long-term investment typically involves holding an asset for more than one year, the entry stage is an important factor to look at. For example, investors who bought Bitcoin in January 2022 would lose 53% on their investments. </p>
<p>On the other hand, investors who purchase BTC in January 2021 will have recorded nearly a 350% return on investment. One way to look at the best entry time is to analyze the prior all-time highs of the token. For example, some investors may prefer investing in a token which has corrected in price and has the potential to trade higher in the long term. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Invest the Best Crypto for Long-Term Growth</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The sections below highlight a step-by-step process on how to buy $WSM tokens &#8211; the best long term crypto investment for 2023. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Set up a Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Install a crypto wallet such as <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> or Trust Wallet on your browser or mobile device.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87358/235710/metamask.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Buy USDT/ETH/BNB</strong></h3>
<p>Buy ETH on <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> and then transfer it to the crypto wallet. </p>
<p>Alternatively, investors can buy Ethereurm/ BNB/ USDT directly on the Wall Street Memes website by using a card. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Connect Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Visit Wall Street Meme&#8217;s website and click &#8216;Buy now&#8217;. Then select the relevant option, depending on which crypto you purchased, and input the amount of $WSM tokens you wish to purchase.</p>
<p>Tokens will be stored on the website and can be claimed when the presale ends.</p>

There&#8217;s also the option to buy $BTCETF tokens with BNB and MATIC, but this isn&#8217;t recommended as you won&#8217;t be eligible for the staking APY.</p>

<p>Buying early in the presale may be prudent given there are 10 presale stages, each with a higher token price than the previous. During the first stage, you can buy $BTCETF tokens for $0.0050, but in the last stage, you&#8217;ll pay $0.0068 per token.</p>
<p>Regardless in which stage you buy, you can maximize your rewards with the staking mechanism. The staking APY currently stands at 500%, which makes it important to stake early on to take advantage of this. As more tokens are bought and staked, the APY will drop.</p>

<p>Instead of the traditional cloud mining method, where users buy cash contracts, The platform offers a user-centric Stake-to-Mine approach. </p>
<p>By staking the $BTCMTX tokens, users get mining credits. These credits can be burned to secure Bitcoin mining power, offering a transparent and simple way to participate in Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>It also offers a user-friendly dashboard to track all the key metrics relating to mining. From monitoring hashing power and mining credit earnings to tracking projected daily, weekly, and monthly rewards, everything is accessible with a simple click. This mobile optimization allows users to engage in mining activities anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</u></a>, the project respects users&#8217; financial freedom. No locked-in contracts allow individuals to unstake and trade their tokens based on market conditions. </p>
<p>The platform offers a dynamic APY of over 190% at press time, with over 220 million tokens staked in its initial month, showing robust community trust.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix has completed a third-party smart contract audit, reinforcing its commitment to user security. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat ($MK) &#8211; ERC20 Web3 Token offers 112% APY and Meme vs Meme Kombat, Raises $1.1M </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat"><u>Meme Kombat ($MK)</u></a> is a new concept that gathers the world&#8217;s most iconic meme tokens together and pits them against each other in combat.</p>
<p>It’s the first presale of its kind with a variety of betting options on fight outcomes. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/334693/screen-shot-2023-10-23-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat home page" /></figure>
<p>Season One features 11 of these meme icons &#8211; Doge, Floki, Baby Doge, Milady, Kishu, Mong, Pepe, Pepe 2, Shiba, Sponge, and Wojack. All fights are processed on chain for increased transparency and the memes are selected at random by AI. So fight outcomes are tamper resistant and harder to predict.</p>
<p>This presale has also put a lot of emphasis on its graphics. State of the art visuals using AI rendering makes the combat as vivid as it can possibly be. This presale is also differentiated based on its high levels of transparency.</p>
<p>It scored very well in its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cmzG-n6ziqdjBfYU7DoRdSHzcxWXImk/view"><u>third party smart contact audit from Coinsult</u></a>. The founder of this presale is also doxxed, meaning he can be publicly viewed on LinkedIn. This is very uncommon within the presale industry. Plus, no tokens have been allocated to a core team.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/334694/screen-shot-2023-10-23-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat token APY" /></figure>
<p>50% of the overall supply (60 million $MK)  is available throughout the presale. Of the remainder, 30% goes to staking and battle rewards, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to community rewards. The total supply is 120 million $MK.</p>
<p>To take part in this exciting new presale, a compatible Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect is required. ETH, USDT, or BNB can be used to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>This is a new paradigm within the meme industry and the price could shoot up when the presale finishes and it lists on an exchange.</p>

<h3><br /><strong>6. Tamadoge &#8211; Top Web 3.0 Coin with Ongoing Bull Run</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/">Tamadoge</a> is a play-to-earn (P2E) ecosystem that leverages blockchain technology to implement in-game earning opportunities for players. Tamadoge offers these P2E features via TAMA &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>With TAMA, players can purchase Tamadoge Pets, which take the form of digital dog-like characters. These pets are minted as NFTs via smart contract functionality, each offering unique characteristics and designs. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/utility-nft-projects.htm"><u>best utility NFTs</u></a> to buy, Tamadoge Pets can be grown and bred for inter-community competitions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/237528/tamadoge-tree.jpg" alt="Tamadoge coins" /></figure>
<p>On Tamadoge, players can utilize their Tamadoge Pets to earn points on a monthly leaderboard. The top performers are rewarded with TAMA tokens. Completing one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm"><u>best crypto ICOs</u></a> in 2022, Tamadoge raised $19 million in over 8 weeks of the presale. </p>
<p>One of the reasons for the successful round stems from the tokens’ tokenomics. TAMA is a deflationary asset with a limited supply of 2 billion tokens. Moreover, 5% of all tokens spent on the ecosystem will be burnt to ensure the demand increases in the long term. </p>
<p>This can potentially make TAMA more valuable than some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm"><u>best meme coins</u></a> like Dogecoin &#8211; which displays inflationary tokenomics due to its 132 billion (and rising) token supply. </p>
<p>In September 2022, Tamadoge was listed on OKX &#8211; its first exchange &#8211; and, after listing on OKX at $0.03 per token, TAMA reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.194 &#8211; a 533% price increase from the list price and near-2,000% increase from the presale price.</p>
<p> As such TAMA has become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ieo-cryptos.htm">best IEO cryptos</a> of this year.</p>
<p>While the coin has since retraced amid the wider chaos in the market following the collapse of FTX, the token is now offering investors a low entry point.</p>
<p>With the main game still in development and an augmented reality app to come in 2023, TAMA looks primed to break out when market conditions improve.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Solana &#8211; Web 3.0 blockchain Offering High Throughput</strong></h3>
<p>A layer-1 blockchain, Solana (SOL), has been created to deploy smart contracts and support the creation of various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and decentralized applications (DApps). While Ethereum is a popular smart contracts platform with the most number of DApps, Solana’s network offers high-speed transactions at a low cost. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225864/solana-home.jpg" alt="Solana blockchain logo" /></figure>
<p>This blockchain network can conduct up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), with an average cost of just $0.00025 per transaction. Solana can offer such high speeds due to its unique algorithm &#8211; which combines Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Proof-of-History (PoH). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225865/sol-price.jpg" alt="Solana price chart" /></figure>
<p> After trading at $1 at the beginning of 2020, SOL reached an ATH of $260 in the same year, making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>fastest growing cryptocurrency</u></a> assets in the year. As of October 2022, SOL has corrected to $34 with a $12 billion market cap. </p>

<h3><strong>10. Decentraland &#8211; Metaverse Real-Estate Project to Buy Now</strong></h3>
<p>Decentraland leverages Web3.0 protocols to offer participants a metaverse ecosystem where virtual real estate can be built, traded and purchased. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Decentraland has implemented several NFT-based use cases for participants. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225866/decentraland-home-ss.jpg" alt="Decentraland metaverse project" /></figure>
<p>For example, Decentraland offers LAND &#8211; an NFT minted as an ERC 721 smart contract representing a digital land parcel. Over 90,000 unique LAND pieces on the ecosystem can be bought, sold and traded. Another NFT on the game is Estate, an ERC 721 smart contract comprising multiple LAND pieces. </p>
<p>These NFTs can be traded via MANA &#8211; the governance token of Decentraland. An ERC-20 token, MANA, is also used to govern the platform on the MANA DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Players can stake MANA and participate in community-wide voting to maintain and secure the network. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225867/mana-price.jpg" alt="Decentraland USD coin price" /></figure>
<p>With a current price of $0.7, MANA is the 41st largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.3 billion. </p>

<h3><strong>11. Ethereum &#8211; Top Smart Contract Protocol with $166 Billion Market Cap</strong></h3>
<p>Similar to Solana, Ethereum is an open-sourced and decentralized Layer-1 blockchain. Ethereum was one of the first blockchains to deploy smart contracts to support DApps creation by developers. The most widely used network, Ethereum, has over 2,700 DApps built on its network.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225870/ethereum-pic.jpg" alt="Ethereum blockchain logo" /></figure>
<p>One of the best web 3.0 coins, Ethereum supports multiple NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea &#8211; which offers the biggest NFT tokens like the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. In 2022, Ethereum officially announced its switch from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus. This move is expected to allow Ethereum to reduce gas fees and increase transaction speed. </p>
<p>After reaching an ATH of $4,900 in 2021, Ethereum has corrected to under $2,000 per token. Despite the price correction, Ethereum is the largest altcoin with a massive market cap of $166 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ETH on eToro</a>
<h3><strong>12. Aurora Finance &#8211; Layer-1 Blockchain with Ethereum Bridge</strong></h3>
<p>Aurora Finance is a layer-1 blockchain and an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) &#8211; a software developers leverage to create DApps, based on the Ethereum network. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225893/aurora-home.jpg" alt="Aurora crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Aurora Finance offers the Aurora Bridge &#8211; a tool which connects its network with the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, developers can access the Ethereum network to deploy DApps on the chain without paying the network&#8217;s high gas fees. Moreover, the bridge can be leveraged to transfer ERC 20 and ETH tokens between Aurora and Ethereum. </p>
<p>By providing more scalability to the Ethereum network, Aurora Finance has become a popular Web 3.0 blockchain project. AURORA, the native cryptocurrency, is used to settle transactions between the bridge. The token also gives users access to the AURORA DAO &#8211; the governance mechanism that promotes decentralized decision-making. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225894/aurora-price.jpg" alt="Aurora to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>AURORA is trading at $1.1 with a market cap of $83 million. </p>
<h3><strong>13. Binance Coin &#8211; Binance’s Governance Token Running on BSC</strong></h3>
<p>Binance Coin is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange &#8211; the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225895/binance-coin.jpg" alt="BNB coin logo" /></figure>
<p>Built on the Ethereum chain, Binance Coin (BNB) is now trading on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) &#8211; a highly scalable blockchain network that offers high throughput, smart contract deployment and faster transaction speeds. BSC is a project built to support the Binance exchange &#8211; which handles the buying and selling over 600 digital assets. </p>
<p>Leveraging BNB on the exchange, the token offers lower transaction costs and is used to govern the network. The BSC allows BNB to conduct up to 160 TPS &#8211; which is greater than Ethereum’s 17 transactions per second. BNB is the 4th largest token with a market cap of $47 billion and one of the best altcoins right now. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225896/bnb-price.jpg" alt="BNB price chart" /></figure>

<h3><strong>14. Yearn.finance &#8211; Web 3.0 Protocol Offering Passive Income Opportunities</strong></h3>
<p>Yearn.finance (YFI) provides various decentralized finance products, which can be leveraged to access passive income via cryptocurrencies. Among the available DeFi products are yield generation, lending aggregation and receiving insurance on the Ethereum blockchain. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90112/225897/yearn-finance-home.jpg" alt="Yearn Finance token" /></figure>

<h2><strong>What is Web 3.0 Crypto?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Web3.0 refers to the decentralized form of the internet. Initially, Web 1.0 was categorized as the beginning of internet technology which first introduced an online forum. Web 2.0 refers to the development of the internet with the introduction of peer-to-peer communication methods. Some of the best technology companies, including Apple, Meta, Amazon and Netflix, are a part of the Web 2.0 community. </p>
<p>However, Web 3.0 looks to make the internet decentralized and give individuals more autonomy. Web 2.0-based companies all act in a centralized manner &#8211; where a central authority controls what the consumer can and cannot control. Web 3.0 leverages blockchain technology to implement smart contracts, which can be used to offer decentralized finance products and protocols. </p>
<p>Web 3.0 cryptos offer DeFi initiatives by providing staking opportunities to allow multiple users to govern the networks, validate transactions and vote towards community-building projects. Thus, the main users of the platform have a say in controlling the network. </p>
<h2><strong>Is Web 3.0 Cryptocurrency a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Here’s a look at the top reasons why Web 3.0 cryptos may be a good investment opportunity:</p>
<h3><strong>Decentralization</strong></h3>
<p>The main benefit of Web 3.0 cryptocurrencies is providing decentralization &#8211; simply meaning that there is no need for third parties to complete activities. For example, banks and financial institutions are the third parties involved in centralized finance. Decentralized finance, on the other hand, allows each individual to have complete control over their assets. </p>
<p>Automated Market Makers like Uniswap allow individuals to directly access liquidity by making them liquidity providers. Thus, funds can be accessed more quicker and can be transferred and swapped at a rapid rate. </p>
<h3><strong>Earning Opportunities</strong></h3>
<p>With the growth of web 3.0 cryptocurrency projects, investors can earn crypto-based rewards in multiple ways. Platforms like Yearn.finance offer passive income-earning opportunities via lending aggregators, yield farming, and staking initiatives. </p>
<p>Furthermore, GameFi cryptos like League of Kingdoms let users access in-game tokens to participate in its fantasy game and battle for cryptocurrency rewards. Similarly, platforms like Battle Infinity offer tradable NFTs, staking platforms and NFT marketplaces with its decentralized platform. </p>
<h2><strong>What Drives the Price of Web 3.0 Coins?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before investing in the best web 3.0 crypto coins, it is important to learn about the price movements and the main driving factors of this space. Similar to other cryptocurrency assets, web 3.0 coins experience high levels of volatility. In the past few years, Bitcoin’s performance has determined the price performance of other digital assets.</p>
<p>For example, some of the best web 3.0 coins, such as Ethereum, Solana and Binance Coin, experienced high upwards movement towards the end of 2021 &#8211; simultaneous to the Bitcoin bull run. In 2022, Bitcoin’s price correction has also resulted in a bear market among the web 3.0 cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Another important driving factor in Web 3.0 is the growing popularity of use cases. With the popularity of the metaverse &#8211; web 3.0 cryptos are implementing playable NFT avatars and in-game earning opportunities. Cryptocurrencies like Tamadoge have soared due to their unique use cases &#8211; such as playable NFT avatars, upcoming AR-based applications and new metaverse partnerships. </p>
<p>Finally, long-term momentum is one of the main drivers of web 3.0 projects. Ethereum has experienced major growth and has become the biggest altcoin in the space. One of the main reasons for this is the implementation of smart contracts and DeFi protocols. Many investors see Web 3.0 as the future of the internet and want to get in early. Therefore, many platforms experience tremendous growth and regular volatility due to the unpredictable nature of these assets in the long-term. </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Web 3.0 cryptocurrencies implement decentralization via blockchain technology &#8211; allowing projects to offer various DeFi protocols, decentralized applications while providing more autonomy to users. </p>
<p>Our top pick right now is Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF). Bitcoin ETF Token has quickly captured investor attention by raising close to $500k within the first week of the presale. It has a speculative nature based on events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC and offers high-reward opportunities, evident in its dynamic APY of 500% at press time.</p>

<p>Before we move on, Jacob Crypto Bury &#8211; one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-discord-groups.htm">best crypto Discord groups</a> regularly discusses the most volatile digital assets on the market.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong><strong>Most volatile</strong> Crypto <strong>With 5</strong><strong>00% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is the hottest new token presale built to take advantage of the hype around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Buy $BTCETF tokens on the Bitcoin ETF Token website by connecting your Ethereum wallet. Use ETH, USDT or a card to purchase the tokens. There&#8217;s an option to use MATIC or BNB to make the purchase. However, $BTCETF tokens purchased with these two coins aren&#8217;t eligible for the staking APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="461" class="alignnone wp-image-130203 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The presale runs in 10 stages where each stage has a higher token price than the previous. During the first stage, you can buy $BTCETF tokens for $0.0050 apiece. In the last stage, the price will go to $0.0068, which is 36% difference. This makes it prudent to buy as early as possible if you&#8217;re looking to participate in the presale to get the lowest price.</p>
<p>Regardless of the stage you participate in, you can still take advantage of the staking APY that stands at 500%. Of course, this won&#8217;t last. As more tokens are bought and staked, the APY will drop, which makes it important to stake your tokens as early as possible if you plan to buy the presale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="350" class="alignnone wp-image-130369 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2.jpg" alt="BTCETF token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877286-btcetf-staking-2-768x299.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The team has employed a deflationary mechanic that will burn up to 25% of the total token supply. This is designed to help the token price in the long run. Each milestone reached around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC will take out 5% of the total supply. This includes milestones such as the ETF approval, the ETF launch and Bitcoin reaching a price of $100,000.</p>

<h3>2<strong>. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; New Crypto With High Passive Income Potential From Bitcoin Cloud Mining</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix</u></a> is a trending new crypto that makes mining accessible for all. Its unique features and promising upside potential have positioned it as an exciting volatile crypto in the Bitcoin cloud mining space.</p>
<p>Within two weeks of its launch, Bitcoin Minetrix raised over $2.7 million. At press time, buyers can buy the $BTCMTX tokens at $0.0113, though this rises at each progressive stage. The platform has a soft cap of $16 million and a hard cap of $33 million for the presale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="438" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123006" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Presale Page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-768x374.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> </p>
<p>The environmental concerns of conventional Bitcoin mining are very apparent. In response, Bitcoin Minetrix introduced an eco-friendly &#8220;Stake-to-Mine&#8221; mechanism. This model reduces the traditional high costs and complexities, making mining more accessible.</p>
<p>Users stake the platform’s native BTCMTX tokens to receive ‘non-tradable’ mining credits. When these credits are burned, they earn Bitcoin, eliminating the need for energy-intensive physical mining setups.</p>
<p>Of the total 4 billion tokens, 42.5% is reserved for mining and 7.5% for staking, with an additional portion dedicated to community initiatives.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</u></a>, Their platform offers a user-friendly dashboard accessible on both desktop and mobile. This dashboard provides a transparent view of mining data, including hashing power, mining credit details, and projected daily, weekly, or monthly earnings.</p>

<p>By tokenizing the system, Bitcoin Minetrix adds an extra layer of security. This move safeguards users against the common scams observed in third-party cloud mining companies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix ensures flexibility for its users, allowing them the freedom to un-stake and trade their $BTCMTX tokens based on market dynamics.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; High-Risk High Reward Crypto With New Approach to the Meme Industry</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is a new style of campaign that allows users to bet on fights between their favorite meme icons. Meme tokens are well known for high levels of volatility in general, the price being driven by the strength of the underlying community. </p>
<p>Meme Kombat revolves around many memes, not just one. This could add to the volatility levels, though it’s a new idea and how the market takes to the concept is not certain. </p>
<h3><img decoding="async" width="900" height="436" class="alignnone wp-image-122512 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40.png" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-300x145.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-768x372.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></h3>
<p>There are three primary betting options with Meme Kombat &#8211; Direct, P v P, and P v Game &#8211; as well as side bets. Users can do research on upcoming fights (Doge vs Floki, Shiba vs Wojack, etc) and check out the odds to see if they would like to place a bet. Battle depictions are designed to be engaging, assisted with AI-rendered images and scenes. </p>
<p>All outcomes are processed on chain also, which could assist in terms of overall transparency. This is a highly transparent project in general, with a publicly viewable founder and a clear smart contract audit.</p>
<p>A number of incentives offset volatility with this presale. It offers a steady 112% APY at the present time, and is priced at a discount in the earlier stages of its presale. Currently priced at $0.166, this will soon rise to $0.183 &#8211; a 10% price increase. It could rise further in subsequent stages or upon exchange listing. </p>
<p><iframe title="Meme Kombat New 100x Potential Meme Coin Crypto Presale LIVE - 112% Staking Rewards &#x1f680;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pf5esWyKM5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This could even be a 100x coin according to some analysts, though this is only a projection and prices can go in either direction, especially when discussing meme projects. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Volatile Community-Focused Meme Token, Now Listed On OKX</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most volatile tokens to invest in right now is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a> ($WSM). Meme tokens are synonymous with being high-risk, high-reward investments.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes platform successfully raised over $25 million in its presale in just a few months. After their 26 September OKX listing, $WSM tokens surged, marking a 275% growth in four days.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/312614/wsm-token-home.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes WSM token" /></figure>
<p>Wall Street Memes is a popular platform, which has over 1 million followers on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. The creators of this platform decided to start their own NFT project in 2021, titled Wall St Bulls. </p>
<p>During the first NFT collection for Wall St Bulls, 10,000 Ethereum NFTs were sold out in 32 minutes. In May 2023, the project also conducted a Wall St Bulls ordinals mint. This shows that it is still active to this date. </p>
<p>After the NFT projects’ success, Wall Street Memes decided to generate wealth for the community through the $WSM token. Like other meme coins, Wall Street Memes will not provide much utility for the user. </p>
<p>But unlike other new meme coins, Wall Street Memes has already garnered a huge community that will help the project grow. To reward this community, $WSM will be given 100% to the public. The token has a maximum supply of 2 billion, 50% of which has been allocated for the ongoing presale.</p>
<p>By the end of the presale, Wall Street Memes aims to raise a hard cap of over $30.57 million. Once the exchange listing takes place, it is possible that the $WSM price could explode due to the popularity of the token.</p>

<h3><strong>6. yPredict &#8211; Access Trading Insights with this Multi-Utility Crypto Token </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> is a crypto platform that offers data-driven trading insights on the crypto markets. $YPRED, the native token, can be leveraged to purchase monthly subscriptions to predictive models on yPredict. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/312615/screen-shot-2023-06-12-at.jpg" alt="yPredict token presale" /></figure>
<p>The platform will host a financial marketplace where predictive models can be purchased. These models have been generated by AI experts and financial quants, who offer analysis on some of the top crypto tokens. To ensure the authenticity and quality of these models, members of the yPredict DAO verify the models before they are released to the public. </p>
<p>yPredict leverages artificial intelligence to offer trading signals on different tokens. Moreover, sentiment analysis is conducted on some of the top cryptos to determine users buying patterns. yPredict also uses a patent-pending pattern recognition algorithm to determine whether certain tokens are bullish or bearish. Thus, members will be able to get proper insights and take well-informed trading decisions. </p>
<p>On yPredict, users can also develop their understanding of cryptos by accessing a Learn2Earn ecosystem. On this environment, users can take quizzes and study about the crypto markets. Notably, one can take quizzes and earn free tokens on yPredict. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/271801/ypredict-features.jpg" alt="yPredict project features" /></figure>
<p>yPredict will also host a staking pool to generate wealth for token holders. 10% of all the new subscription fees collected will be sent to existing token holders. Furthermore, 15% of the swapping fees collected is also shared through a staking pool. This ensures that community members are rewarded by participating in the ecosystem. </p>
<p>yPredict will also let users make directional bets on the future of crypto markets through its play-to-earn platform. The top performers can earn $YPRED tokens as rewards. Currently, $YPRED is available to buy during the sixth presale round for $0.09 per token. </p>
<p>The $YPRED price will rise to $0.12 once the exchange listing takes place. This project has managed to raise more than $3.5 million since its launch.

<p>TAMA has been in the top 10 of meme coins by volume since launch and experts are predicting more volatility in 2023, where the project could breakout as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">best new cryptocurrency</a> projects with numerous milestones on its roadmap set to be reached.</p>
<p>One of the main P2E elements of this platform is Tamadoge pets &#8211; NFT avatars portrayed as virtual dogs and pets. Players can buy, sell and trade these NFTs on the Tama store &#8211; where other virtual items can be bought to breed an individual’s pet NFTs. </p>
<p>Eventually, players can take part in community-wide competitions and compete for points on a monthly leaderboard to earn TAMA rewards.</p>
<p>TAMA is also a deflationary asset with a 2 billion token supply, with 5% of all TAMA tokens bought in the pet store &#8211; where you buy food, treats and upgrades for your pet &#8211; will be burned to ensure long-term growth.

<p>With the main game, two arcade-style mini-games and an augmented reality app expected to be released, TAMA appears set for a huge 2023.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Battle Infinity &#8211; Emerging P2E Crypto with High Growth Potential </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> is a decentralized cryptocurrency platform that offers a virtual ecosystem where players stand a chance to earn various cryptocurrency rewards by taking part in various P2E features. </p>
<p>On Battle Infinity, members can compete in the IBAT Premier league &#8211; a decentralized sports fantasy league. Moreover, users can join the Battle Arena &#8211; a virtual ecosystem where all characters and items are minted as NFTs via ERC 721 smart contract functionality. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219972/ibat-sep-13-2022.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity token to BNB price chart" /></figure>
<p>These features can be accessed via IBAT &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. IBAT tokens can be purchased and swapped with other cryptos on the IBAT Battle Swap &#8211; Battle Infinity’s decentralized exchange (DEX). The token can be staked on the IBAT Battle Stake &#8211; a staking platform on Battle Infinity where investors can accumulate interest on their holdings. </p>
<p>IBAT completed its three-month presale in only 24 days before launching on PancakeSwap &#8211; the popular DEX. After completing one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">best crypto ICOs</a> in 2022, IBAT launched on PanckaeSwap in August 2022 &#8211; one of the top decentralized exchanges. </p>
<p>After launching at $0.0015, IBAT reached $0.11 on PancakeSwap &#8211; equating to a 7x price increase. Being a recently launched cryptocurrency, IBAT has met with volatility and has retraced to a price of $0.0038 per token. However, it has outperformed top crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2022 and will launch on more exchanges soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Battle Infinity</a>
<h3><strong>9. Lucky Block &#8211; Volatile Cryptocurrency &amp; NFT Platform</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://luckyblock.com/">Lucky Block</a> is an NFT-based competition platform where investors can participate in weekly competitions and draws. The platform manages transactions and settles rewards in LBLOCK &#8211; the governance token of Lucky Block. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219974/lblock-0-0007.jpg" alt="Lucky Block token price chart" /></figure>
<p>Recently, LBLOCK launched a new token version (V2) &#8211; an ERC-20 token more easily listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs). The V2 token also charges no transaction fees, making it beneficial for investors. On the other hand, the V1 token is a BEP-20 protocol which attracts a 12% transaction fee. </p>
<p>The V2 token has been listed on MEXC and Gate.io &#8211; two of the largest centralized exchanges in the space. LBLOCK (V2) is trading at $0.0007 per token. </p>
<p>The project recently announced there will be a bridge going live on October 3 so V1 holders can convert to V2, while CEO Scott Ryder also revealed that from September 30 the coin will be subject to a 1% monthly burn, drastically cutting supply.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Dogecoin &#8211; Most Unstable Crypto with High-Risk High-Reward Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) has emerged as one of the most volatile cryptocurrencies in the last few years. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a>, DOGE became widely popular for its unique Shiba Inu logo, which helped bring a strong social media presence. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219975/doge-sep-price.jpg" alt="Dogecoin to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Furthermore, Dogecoin has faced regular volatility and price changes due to the coin’s backing by billionaire Elon Musk &#8211; who has regularly backed this popular digital asset. Between January to May 2021 &#8211; DOGE experienced a staggering 13,900% price increase. </p>
<p>However, the token has now corrected by over 90% since its highs and DOGE is currently trading at around $0.06 per token. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy Dogecoin on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>11. Binance &#8211; Native Token of the Biggest Cryptocurrency Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>Binance (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange &#8211; the largest crypto trading exchange in terms of trading volume. The exchange offers trading opportunities in over 600 digital assets at a lower trading fee of 0.1% per transaction. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219979/bnb-sep-13-price-chart.jpg" alt="BNB to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>With BNB, investors can get a 25% on transactions, making it a useful asset. Launched in 2017, BNB reached an all-time high of $690 in 2021. </p>
<p>However, this volatile cryptocurrency has corrected to $295 during the bear market of 2022. Despite the drop, BNB is the 5th largest cryptocurrency with a $45 billion market cap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy BNB via eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>12. ApeCoin &#8211; NFT Crypto with the Highest Volatility</strong></h3>
<p>ApeCoin (APE) is an ERC-20 token and the governance coin of the APE DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) &#8211; which aims to provide users with a decentralized and community-building platform. </p>
<p>The cryptocurrency powers the entire Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) ecosystem &#8211; one of the most popular NFT collections in the digital assets space. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219982/apecoin-sep-13-price.jpg" alt="ApeCoin to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>After increasing from $7 to an ATH of $39, APE has corrected to under $6 per token. This volatile cryptocurrency has noticed a huge price drop following the crypto and NFT bear market but will look to regain its position with the next bull run. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Invest in ApeCoin using eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>13. Ethereum &#8211; Volatile Altcoin with 60% Price Drop in 2022</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) is the largest altcoin, with a market cap of more than $210 billion. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the ongoing uncertain global economic conditions have made the token a volatile investment in 2022, but it could bounce back when market conditions improve in 2023.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219983/eth-sep-13-price.jpg" alt="Ethereum to USD chart" /></figure>
<p>After reaching an ATH of $4,900 in November 2021, ETH is trading at $1,200 at the time of writing in December 2022.</p>
<p>Despite the volatile price movements, Ethereum has provided a return on investment (ROI) of more than 60,000% since its inception. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ETH on eToro</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>14. Dogelon Mars &#8211; Popular Shitcoin with Regular Price Movements</strong></h3>
<p>Dogelon Mars was trending as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">best shitcoins</a> towards the end of 2021, as the token increased by over 32,000% between April and July. </p>
<p>However, ELON does not seem to provide real utility and instead became successful by marketing itself as a meme token linking itself to Elon Musk. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219984/dogelon-mars-sep-price.jpg" alt="Dogelon Mars to USD chart" /></figure>
<p>After the initial price success, this volatile cryptocurrency has lost more than 99% of its valuation. Currently, Dogelon Mars is trading at $0.00000025 per token. </p>
<h3><strong>15. Bitcoin &#8211; Largest Cryptocurrency to Invest in</strong></h3>
<p>Despite being the first and largest cryptocurrency in the space, Bitcoin has been one of the most volatile cryptos to invest in. </p>
<p>Patient investors would have benefitted from this token’s spectacular rise from lesser than $1 in 2009 to nearly $70K in 2021. However, BTC regularly faces major price corrections on a yearly basis. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219985/bitcoin-sep-price-chart.jpg" alt="Bitcoin to USD chart" /></figure>
<p>For example, after reaching the $20,000 mark for the first time in 2017, Bitcoin was in a bear market for the next few years. The token only crossed the $20K mark again in 2020, signaling the beginning of a year-long bull run that saw the coin reach $60K. </p>
<p>After another bull-run which ended with Bitcoin reaching an ATH of $69,000 in November 2021, the popular digital asset has corrected to the $20K levels once again. </p>
<p>But the successful historical performance makes Bitcoin one of the best digital assets to buy at a lower price range. With a market cap of $433 billion, Bitcoin is trading at $21,888 and remains the top crypto on the market. Some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a> have proposed the idea that BTC could reach levels exceeding $65k by 2025 provided that widespread adoption and energy consumption issues are dealt with. </p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>16. Shiba Inu &#8211; New Meme Token for High-Risk Investors </strong></h3>
<p>After the popularity of meme tokens like Dogecoin, many spin-off cryptocurrencies have been created in the past few years. In 2020, Shiba Inu launched its ERC-20 token and marketed itself as the ‘Dogecoin Killer’. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219986/shiba-inu-sep-13-price.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu token price chart" /></figure>
<p>The cryptocurrency is listed on the platform’s own decentralized exchange &#8211; ShibaSwap, and has been created anonymously by a person that goes by the synonym ‘Ryoshi’.</p>
<p>In 2021, Shiba Inu became one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest growing cryptocurrency</a> coins as it soared from $0.000000000168 to an ATH of $0.00008845. In October 2021, the token briefly overtook Dogecoin to become the 10th largest cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>However, Dogecoin has regained its position over Shiba Inu in 2022. The Dogecoin Killer has lost 86% of its market cap since the ATH and has been an extremely volatile asset in 2022. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Shiba Inu via eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>17. Decentraland &#8211; High-Risk Metaverse Crypto Coin</strong></h3>
<p>Decentraland is a virtual real estate platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain &#8211; facilitating buy, sell and trading options for platform members. The main tradable feature on Decentraland is LAND &#8211; an ERC-721 token that represents a piece of virtual land. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219987/decentraland-sep-price.jpg" alt="Decentraland token price chart" /></figure>
<p>LAND can be purchased on the ecosystem with MANA &#8211; an ERC-20 token that acts as the native cryptocurrency of Decentraland. The platform also integrated a third NFT token known as Estate &#8211; which is an ERC-721 that represents merged plots of LAND. </p>
<p>After releasing in 2017 for $0.025, MANA soared to an ATH of $5.90 towards the end of 2021. Since Decentraland emerged as one of the biggest metaverse-based cryptos, the token has also attracted high levels of volatility in 2022. Similar to the other top cryptos, MANA has faced the brunt of the 2022 bear market. </p>
<p>Currently, MANA is trading at $0.75 &#8211; 87% below its highs set in 2021. However, many investors believe this is just the beginning of the metaverse, which is one of the reasons for the constant price volatility in the short term. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Invest in Decentraland using eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>18. Solana &#8211; Open-Sourced Platform with High Transaction Speed</strong></h3>
<p>Solana (SOL) is a popular open-sourced blockchain, meaning that it keeps all the transaction records public and provides transparency to all investors. </p>
<p>By deploying smart contracts on the network, Solana is capable of listing various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, dApps (decentralized applications) and NFTs. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219989/sol-coin-price-chart.jpg" alt="Solana to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>While Ethereum is the largest blockchain in smart contracts and protocols listed, investors are looking for an alternative due to the high transaction costs and low speed. Solana can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum’s average of just 17. </p>
<p>SOL, the native token, rose from $0.78 in 2020 to an ATH of $260 in 2021. However, SOL has met with high levels of volatility since its 2021 levels and is currently trading at $35 per token. </p>

<h2><strong>How to Discover the Most Volatile Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>For traders looking to make short-term profits by buying and selling volatile assets, here are a few techniques that may help you in doing so: </p>
<h3><strong>Analyze the Historical Price</strong></h3>
<p>Investors can try assessing the historical price performance of digital assets when looking for volatility. For example, Bitcoin is one such cryptocurrency which provides large price corrections following highs. But, the bull markets and bear markets run for long periods of time. </p>
<p>On the other hand, new tokens such as Shiba Inu may provide more frequent volatility, which is what day traders may look to take advantage of. Studying an asset’s graph is the simplest way to understand the levels of volatility to expect in the future. </p>
<h3><strong>Track Crypto Presales and ICOs</strong></h3>
<p>Investing in crypto ICOs is a high-risk high-reward investment due to the frequent levels of volatility that tokens may expect. For example, Battle Infinity’s IBAT provided 7x returns throughout its presale and PancakeSwap launch. </p>
<p>If traders discover fundamentally strong assets that have just been released in the market, strong volatility in the short-term can eventually lead to major price increases in the long-term. </p>
<h2><strong>When Are Cryptos the Most Volatile?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Another important factor to discuss is examining when a particular cryptocurrency may deliver high levels of volatility. The sections below discuss a few points to consider when determining the expected volatility of a cryptocurrency. </p>
<h3><strong>Price of Bitcoin </strong></h3>
<p>Controlling 40% of the entire crypto market share, Bitcoin is the world&#8217;s largest digital asset. Due to the token’s control over the cryptocurrency space, most of the largest altcoins perform similarly to the price of Bitcoin. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87494/219991/btc-vs-eth-vs-mana-price-comparison.jpg" alt="Bitcoin weekly price chart" />
<figcaption>Most volatile cryptos price comparison</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, when Bitcoin reached its ATHs in November 2021, top cryptos like Ethereum, Solana and Decentraland also enjoyed strong bull runs. Similarly, Bitcoin’s price decline, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the collapse of FTX have all led to a long crypto bear market. </p>
<p>Therefore, investors may choose to invest in new assets when Bitcoin shows strong signs of reversal. </p>
<h3><strong>All-Time Highs</strong></h3>
<p>While deciphering the future price movements of cryptos is impossible, many investors know what to expect with the major altcoins in the long term. </p>
<p>For example, Doge and Shiba Inu attract high levels of volatility, while tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum can potentially push the entire markets into a bull run. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty and volatility after a cryptocurrency reaches its ATH. After Bitcoin crossed $70,000, many investors thought the token would reach $100,000 by the end of 2021. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no historical information to base the cryptocurrency price predictions. Therefore, most cryptos are unpredictable after crossing their all-time highs. </p>
<h2><strong>Are Volatile Cryptos a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have proven to be profitable investments for traders that have entered the market at the right times. Even with volatile investments, a good, diversified portfolio has the potential to be a good investment.</p>
<p>For example, many small-cap and new cryptocurrencies tend to deliver high growth in a short amount of time. High-risk investors or day traders that successfully manage to observe potentially successful trends have the opportunity to make small yet regular profits by trading volatile assets. </p>
<p>Since day traders rely heavily on technical analysis and various graphing patterns, volatile cryptocurrencies can be one of the best investment classes for quick growth. </p>
<p>Secondly, cryptocurrencies have positioned themselves as an alternative to traditional investments. A diversified portfolio may contain a range of stock options, ETFs and a small number of cryptocurrencies. Importantly, even adding a small portion of volatile cryptos can lead to potentially profitable trades.</p>
<p>However, it is important to only invest what one can afford to lose when dealing in cryptocurrencies. Due to the volatile nature of these assets, investors should not put 100% of their allocated resources in 1 single trade or investment. </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Throughout this guide, we&#8217;ve looked at some of the most volatile cryptos on the market right now. However, after analyzing the most volatile cryptocurrencies to trade in 2023, we recommend Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF).</p>
<p>This is a speculative token that aims to take advantage of the events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval process by the SEC. With over $500,000 raised in slightly over a week, this could be highly rewarding investment when it launches on major exchanges.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What is the most unstable crypto?</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token is a trending new platform that already has raised over $600,000 in slightly over one week of its launch. Buyers can grab the BTCETF tokens for just $0.0052 in the ongoing presale,</p>
<p><strong>What time is crypto most volatile?</strong></p>
<p>Cryptos can be very volatile after reaching an ATH. Since there is no historical price data to match future performance, it is impossible to properly analyze a cryptocurrency after they surpass its highest price range. </p>
<p><strong>Is volatile crypto a good investment?</strong></p>
<p>Volatile cryptos can be a good investment for day traders looking to make regular profits. Moreover, a diversified portfolio containing a mixture of low and high-risk asset classes may lead to potential profits in the long-term. </p>

<h3>1. Meme Kombat &#8211; Stake To Earn Meme Crypto With Betting Options And APY Rewards, $850K Raised</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is a meme-fighting presale where spectators can bet on the outcome. It&#8217;s not a move to earn crypto in the traditional sense of the word, being more of a staking and betting ecosystem, but it could prove to be a much better alternative.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat has the appeal of multiple memes within a single architecture. Given the size of online meme movements and the passion of their followers, this could turn out to be a very interesting situation. </p>

<p>Season One of Meme Kombat features 11 of the world’s most iconic meme tokens &#8211; Doge, Kishu, Mong, Floki, Pepe, Pepe 2, Shiba, Baby Doge, Milady, Sponge, and Wojack. These memes fight it out one on one. Fights are selected at random.</p>
<p>There are multiple betting mechanisms on the outcome of the fights, with the results automatically processed on the blockchain. This helps with transparency, as the rewards are automatically processed.</p>
<p>The ecosystem uses AI to render engaging animations of the memes in question. The traits and characteristics of the original meme icons have been adhered to as closely as possible, while being upgraded where necessary.</p>
<p>The presale has already raised over $850,000 and the price per token is just  $0.1667, though this figure will increase over the next few weeks to $0.183, a 10% increase. That’s a 10% appreciation for simply buying and holding a coin, outside of the PoS APY and possible revenue from correct wagers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="377" class="alignnone wp-image-122514 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58.png" alt="Meme Kombat Tokenomics " srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58-300x126.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58-768x322.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>It provides an easy way to earn at the present time, though prices can always go in either direction, and meme tokens are known for volatility. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Fight Out &#8211; Top Move-To-Earn Crypto with Fitness App and Real-World Gyms</strong></h3>
<p>One high-quality move-to-earn crypto project is the newly launched <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/fightout/">Fight Out. </a> The hugely exciting project is one of our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">best new crypto to invest in for 2023</a>and will push the move-to-earn space further than before by tracking and customizing full-body workouts and rewarding individuals for their efforts in the gym or at home in its own fitness app.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/243392/fighout-app.jpg" alt="Fight Out mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Fight Out also has ambitious plans to blend the real world with Web3 and will open real-world gyms in key locations across the world, partner with professional athletes and elite coaches, with members able to access fully customized workouts that not only help improve strength and cardio but also wellness and mental fortitude. </p>
<p>Unlike other M2E projects like STEPN, which just covers steps, Fight Out uses smart technology to track movement and key effort indicators, with all data points feeding into an algorithm.</p>
<p>Users create an NFT avatar &#8211; which is soulbound and cannot be traded, but is fully customizable &#8211; that represents their fitness profile, and then log into the mobile app which tailors bespoke workouts and then measures progress and achievements.</p>
<p>As well as general fitness, other metrics such as nutrition and sleep can be added to further tailor their personalized workout programs. Fight Out members are able to access a workout builder program that offers personalized routines and exercises prepared by in-house coaches and personal trainers. </p>
<p>With technique being key to increasing fitness, each exercise is explained through high-quality instructional videos &#8211; live classes are also available.</p>
<p>Fight Out is currently in talks with world boxing champions, MMA fighters and pro wrestlers for their ambassador program, which will not only serve to promote the brand but will provide masterclass-style content and behind-the-scenes access to training camps.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/243393/fightout-roadmap.jpg" alt="Fight Out roadmap" /></figure>
<p>The project’s native token, FGHT, is currently going through its presale and will grant holders access to the app and gym via subscription and membership. A second currency, REPS, will serve as the in-app currency and can be redeemed for rewards such as training equipment, supplements and apparel.</p>
<p>REPS will also earn holders discounts on monthly memberships or pay for remote consultations with experts and is earned for completing workouts and leveling up their NFT avatar. The avatar is the digital fitness profile of the holder and further rewards can be earned by pitting themselves against others in daily, weekly and monthly competitions.</p>
<p>FGHT is currently on sale for $0.0166 with a total supply of 10 billion tokens &#8211; 60% of those will be sold in the presale, 10% for exchange liquidity and 30% for rewards and growth of the project, with investors able to earn bonuses during the presale by deciding to lock their tokens for longer periods.</p>
<p>The Fight Out CEO co-owns a boxing gym and comes from a background in combat sports, while the senior group are doxxed and have helped develop other fitness apps. Of the $100 million presale target, 70% will be used to build and refurbish gyms, 18% on marketing and 12% on product development.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Tamadoge &#8211; Top move-to-earn Crypto Project</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge</a> is an exciting cryptocurrency project that has announced M2E features on its project roadmap. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-earn-blockchain-based-games.htm">best play-to-earn blockchain-based games</a>, Tamadoge offers in-game earning opportunities with TAMA &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>TAMA can be used to purchase Tamadoge pets &#8211; NFTs that represent a unique virtual dog. These NFTs can be purchased along with other virtual items on the Tama store. Players can leverage these NFTs to compete for TAMA on a monthly leaderboard.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/223254/tamadoge-gains.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto game" /></figure>
<p>According to the Tamadoge whitepaper, the cryptocurrency aims to launch move-to-earn functionality with its upcoming augmented reality Tamadoge app. The app will retain the same P2E dynamics as the web-based platform and will reward players for walking their AR-based Tamadoge pets. </p>
<p>This platform feature is expected to launch by Q4 2023. With a token supply of 2 billion, 5% of all TAMA spent on the ecosystem will be burnt, which will help maintain the value of the token in the long term.</p>
<p>Concluding one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> in 2022, Tamadoge raised $19 million in its ICO round and then pumped to gains of nearly 2,000% during its initial exchange offering on OKX.</p>
<p>Apart from the AR app, the main Tamadoge game will see players grow and care for pets, then battle against other players as they move up a leaderboard and earn prizes. Other mini-games are also in development for 2023.</p>
<p>Interested readers can follow Tamadoge’s <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Telegram Channel</a> to stay updated with the project. <i>Telegram admins will never DM you first.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en"><strong>Buy TAMA on OKX</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>4. Battle Infinity &#8211; M2E Metaverse Platform </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> (IBAT) is another P2E platform that leverages blockchain technology to incorporate in-game rewards on its decentralized platform. </p>
<p>The main P2E feature of this cryptocurrency is the Battle Arena &#8211; a metaverse ecosystem where players can take part in various events and concerts via VR headsets. Therefore, the platform aims to implement M2E crypto elements through its ecosystem. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IBAT-Premier-League.png" alt="IBAT Premier League" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, all virtual items and characters on the metaverse are minted as NFT by leveraging ERC 721 smart contacts on the Battle Market &#8211; Battle Infinity’s NFT marketplace. Players can also participate in the IBAT Premier League &#8211; a decentralized sports fantasy league requiring players to join after purchasing NFT passes. </p>
<p>Therefore, users can find some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">best NFTs to buy</a> on this ecosystem, leveraging them to participate in competitions and build their own 3D characters. </p>
<p>All the main P2E features can be accessed through the native token &#8211; IBAT. This cryptocurrency can be purchased through the Battle Swap &#8211; Battle Infinity’s own DEX. IBAT can be staked to earn interest on the Battle Stake and is also used to distribute rewards. </p>
<p>Battle Infinity (IBAT) concluded one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">best crypto ICOs</a> after raising 16,500 BNB worth of IBAT in only 24 days. IBAT has since been listed on PancakeSwap &#8211; reaching a high of $0.0105 &#8211; a 7x price increase from its $0.0015 presale launch price. </p>
<p>The token has since regressed amid the wider crypto bear market but is still trading at $0.002.</p>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/"><strong>Visit Battle Infinity</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>5. STEPN &#8211; Move-to-Earn Lifestyle App</strong></h3>
<p>Built on the Solana blockchain, STEPN is a unique move-to-earn cryptocurrency project, categorizing itself as a ‘Web3 lifestyle app’. Providing a fitness app, STEPN allows players to earn in-game rewards by walking, jogging or running. </p>
<p>On STEPN, players need to purchase NFT sneakers &#8211; which vary in price depending on their characteristics, rarity and other attributes. One of the best NFT games to play, STEPN aims to promote a healthier lifestyle for millions of people by incentivizing monetary rewards. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/STEPN-GMT.png" alt="STEPN mobile app" /></p>
<p>The platform’s main governance token is GMT (Green Metaverse Token) &#8211; which can be used to access premium content and customization options. Notably, the NFT sneakers level up as and when players physically move and are tracked with a GPS. The platform also incorporated the moonwalking technique, ensuring that the player is properly monitored throughout their move goal.</p>
<p>As players reach level 30 or higher, GMT tokens can be accessed and can also be swapped with USDC. GMT has a circulating supply of 600 million tokens &#8211; representing 10% of the total supply. After trading at just $0.15 in March 2022, GMT reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4.11 in April 2022. </p>
<p>However, amid the ongoing bear market and complaints from the community about the rewards system being flawed, GMT has collapsed to a price of just $0.40.</p>
<h3><strong>6. GST (Green Satoshi Token) &#8211; Utility Token of STEPN</strong></h3>
<p>Like GMT, the Green Satoshi Token (GST) is an integral part of the STEPN ecosystem. While GMT can be used as a governance token, GST is the platform’s utility token. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/222448/gst-token.jpg" alt="GST STEPN token" /></figure>
<p>Once the players purchase their NFT shoes, they can access the Solo mode to start earning GST tokens by moving. To win tokens, players need to earn energy &#8211; 1 energy is equivalent to 5 minutes of move &amp; earn movement. </p>
<p>Since the platform offers different NFT sneakers, each design offers different efficiency levels. Therefore, energy can be earned faster per sneaker type. For example, the ‘Runner’ NFT sneaker can provide a return of 6 GST per 1 energy achieved at the optimal speed. </p>
<p>With GST, users can also mint sneakers and level up by leveraging GMT tokens as well. </p>
<p>With an unlimited token supply, GST has a live market cap of $2.5 million and is currently trading at $0.07 per token. </p>
<p>The token, like GMT, has suffered amid negative reviews from its users and the wider crypto bear market.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Step App &#8211; FitFi Cryptocurrency Project</strong></h3>
<p>Step App (FITFI) is a unique M2E cryptocurrency project that&#8217;s based on the FitFi niche &#8211; an amalgamation of fitness and finance. Similar to STEPN, the Step App offers a protocol where players can compete in fitness quests with their metaverse avatars. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/222449/step-app-home.jpg" alt="Step mobile app" /></figure>
<p>The platform uses augmented reality-based technology to bridge the gap between the metaverse and reality. Sneaks represent playable NFTs that each player must purchase to track their in-game progress. </p>
<p>After downloading this move-to-earn crypto app, players can earn tokens by walking or jogging. FITFI is the Step app&#8217;s governance token, fueled by the ecosystem fees. The platform also offers KCAL tokens &#8211; the in-game tokens earned and can be used to purchase Sneak NFTs. </p>
<p>FITFI has a maximum supply of 5 billion tokens, trading at $0.04 as of mid-December 2022.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Dotmoovs &#8211; Sports-Based M2E Cryptocurrency</strong></h3>
<p>Dotmoovs is a sports and tech company &#8211; leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to deploy unique algorithms that can detect human movement. The platform uses an arbitration engine to measure players’ limb position and movement to measure their skill. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/222450/dotmoovs-home.jpg" alt="Dotmoovs web3 game" /></figure>
<p>Incorporating NFTs and its own cryptocurrency (MOOV), players can take part in peer-to-peer challenges on the network. After the AI detects a player&#8217;s various sports tricks and skills, an individual can earn MOOV tokens as a reward.</p>
<p>Tokens can also be earned by participating in dance and soccer tournaments and are used to purchase in-game items and update virtual avatars &#8211; minted as NFTs. </p>
<p>The platform also has its own NFT marketplace &#8211; where players can purchase virtual items such as soccer balls, sneakers and more. </p>
<p>With a 1 billion maximum supply, nearly 75% of MOOV tokens are now available to trade. MOOV is trading at $0.003 per token. </p>
<h3><strong>9. Genopets &#8211; NFT Avatars Representing a Player’s Performance </strong></h3>
<p>Genopets (GENE) is a free-to-play and M2E cryptocurrency platform based on the Solana blockchain. Promoting users to lead an active lifestyle, Genopets tracks users’ steps data from their mobile phones to incorporate play-to-earn economics. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Genopets.png" alt="Genopets crypto project" /></figure>
<p>On this platform, investors can summon their own Genopets &#8211; NFT avatars representing an individual’s performance. Players can grow their pets by physically moving and activating their NFT avatars. </p>
<p>On the Genoverse, players can battle with other players by competing in challenges, compete daily to keep their Genopets happy and win rewards in the process. GENE is the governance token of Genopets and is used to represent an individual Genopets value on the platform. </p>
<p>Currently, only 4 million of the total 100 million supply of GENE tokens are available to trade. </p>
<p>GENE reached an all time high of $35 in November 2021, but 13 months later tokens are trading at just $0.63.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Wirtual &#8211; Popular Move-to-Earn Cryptocurrency to Invest in 2023</strong></h3>
<p>Wirtual is an M2E crypto app that rewards customers for exercising and taking care of their bodies. Originally started as a test project in the science of growth methodology, the creators of Wirtual wanted to discover a way to make exercising more fun. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WIRTUAL-.png" alt="WIRTUAL move-to-earn mobile app" /></p>
<p>With the Wirtual app, users can connect the apps with their fitness devices and earn tokens while running, swimming, dancing, cycling or working out. The native cryptocurrency of this platform is WIRTUAL &#8211; which can be earned when users conduct various physical activities. </p>
<p>With a fully diluted market cap of $147 million, WIRTUAL is trading at $0.147 per token. </p>
<h3><strong>11. MetaGym &#8211; Exercise-to-Earn Cryptocurrency </strong></h3>
<p>MetaGym has advertised itself as the metaverse’s first Exercise-to-Earn (E2E) cryptocurrency gym. Providing M2E capabilities, MetaGym comes with a free-to-use app that rewards players with MGCN &#8211; its native cryptocurrency built on the Polygon network. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/222454/metagym-home.jpg" alt="Meta Gym crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The platform allows players to access MetaGym Buddies &#8211; which are NFT avatars that can complete fitness challenges and track an individual&#8217;s progress. The MGCN token can be used to upgrade these NFT avatars and purchase virtual items to design the MetaGym Buddies. </p>
<p>Players must acquire a MetaGym web3 wallet and transfer Polygon (MATIC) to begin purchasing the NFT avatars. Players are rewarded with MGCN depending on their performance. With a limited market cap of 2 billion, MGCN is a deflationary asset that can potentially increase in price in the long term.</p>
<h3><strong>12. DOSE &#8211; Native Cryptocurrency of the OliveX Metaverse</strong></h3>
<p>DOSE is a native cryptocurrency which can be earned by competing in various workout-based gameplayers on the OliveX Metaverse. This ecosystem provides players with gamified fitness experiences &#8211; leveraging blockchain technology to monetize various physical activities. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DOSE-token-home.png" alt="Dustland metaverse game" /></p>
<p>DOSE is the central token of the OliveX ecosystem and can be used to purchase in-game items and earn rewards. Players can earn DOSE tokens by taking part in games on the OliveX platform, such as Dustland Runner &#8211; a proof of workout audio game. </p>
<p>The Dustland Runner <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-games.htm">crypto game</a> is set in a dystopian future where the earth has been burnt and only consists of dustlands and pirates. Players can complete challenges in the game by physically walking and jogging throughout the course of the gameplay. </p>
<p>With a circulating supply of nearly 6 million tokens, DOSE is currently trading at $0.006 per token.</p>
<h2><strong>What to Consider When Investing in Move to Earn Crypto Coins</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before investing in the best M2E cryptocurrencies, let’s look at some of the main factors to consider before investing in this space. </p>
<h3><strong>Unique Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>The M2E cryptocurrency space is still a new and upcoming niche. While most of the projects in this space look to combine in-game earning with moving, a few projects stand out. </p>
<p>FightOut is one because it is not only offering a revolutionary fitness app &#8211; that will provide tailored workout programs and a robust rewards system &#8211; but the project also plans to build real-world gyms in key locations around the globe and integrate them with Web3 technology.</p>
<h3><strong>Token Supply</strong></h3>
<p>One way to analyze a token is by reviewing the cryptocurrency&#8217;s total supply. One of the reasons why Tamadoge (TAMA) is among the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins to buy</a> is due to its tokenomics. With a maximum supply of 2 billion, TAMA has positioned itself as a deflationary asset. On the other hand, tokens like Dogecoin have increased their supply from 100 billion to 132 billion tokens. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Tamadoge will burn 5% of all tokens spent on the ecosystem to ensure the supply does not outweigh the demand. M2E tokens that offer such strong characteristics have the potential to deliver high growth. </p>
<h2><strong>Are Move to Earn Crypto Projects a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although M2E cryptocurrency projects are not a well-established niche, a high-risk, high-reward element is involved when investing in this space. Some of the best M2E projects also offer tokens at a low price. </p>
<p>For example, FightOut is one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to buy at current levels, with FGHT tokens available at just $0.016 each. However, investors with a high-risk appetite may want to invest in such cryptocurrencies for the long term. While popular cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have corrected by 70% in 2022, FGHT has huge potential for the future and a lot of room to grow.</p>
<p>Therefore, diversifying in the best M2E projects may lead to significant upwards movement. Moreover, the move-to-earn cryptocurrency movement may also appeal to investors with Web3 and blockchain technology development. It is estimated that the metaverse may have a market cap of $5 trillion by 2030. Since this is just the start of incorporating AI-based technologies via crypto protocols, long-term investors may benefit from their investments. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88538/243388/metamask2.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet app" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Acquire ETH, BNB, or USDT</strong></h3>
<p>$MK can be exchanged for ETH, USDT, or BNB. Users can go to an exchange and purchase the token, sending it to their MetaMask wallet account. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Connect to Meme Kombat</strong></h3>
<p>The next step is to connect to the Meme Kombat presale page, in order to make the purchase. </p>

<p>When connected, additional information should be displayed on the presale form. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Execute Transaction</strong></h3>
<p>Another screen will appear and investors should input the amount they wish to buy &#8211; remembering to leave a small amount of ETH to cover gas (transaction) fees.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="665" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123294" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698680526-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-41-12.png" alt="Meme Kombat Presale Information" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698680526-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-41-12.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698680526-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-41-12-300x222.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1698680526-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-41-12-768x567.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Investors can also decide on their vesting period, with the longer you lock tokens for providing more rewards. Locking for 24 months will earn an extra 25% bonus, for example.</p>
<p>Hit &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; and complete the transaction.</p>
<p>$MK tokens will be stored on the Meme Kombat website and can be claimed when the presale is finished.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Move-to-Earn (M2E) cryptocurrencies combine physical activity with in-game earning opportunities to incentivize players. </p>
<p>But stake to earn can often be a viable alternative, especially if it&#8217;s a high-quality presale.</p>
<p>We recommend Meme Kombat as it has huge levels of project transparency, trades at a discount in its early presale stage, and offers a novel new concept of meme vs meme fighting, with betting options on the outcome. </p>

<h2><strong>Analyzing the Most Promising Cryptocurrency to Buy</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The most promising digital assets offer unique use cases which can potentially make them profitable investments in the long-term. The sections below conduct an in-depth analysis of the most promising crypto projects for 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong><strong>Most Promising Crypto Offering </strong><strong>With </strong><strong>Over 500% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Up To 25% Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is the most promising crypto this year, based on real world events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. With each milestone achieved, such as the ETF approval and the ETF launch, the team will burn 5% of the total token supply. The goal is to remove up to 25% of the tokens from circulation to help the token price.</p>
<p>Participate in the $BTCETF token presale by connecting your Ethereum wallet to the token presale site. Use ETH, USDT or card to make the purchase and avoid MATIC and BNB as you won&#8217;t be eligible for the staking APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="461" class="alignnone wp-image-130203 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The $BTCETF token presale runs in 10 stages where each stage has a higher price than the previous stage. You can buy the tokens in the first stage at a price of $0.0050, which gradually goes up to $0.0068 in the final stage. If you&#8217;re looking to buy the presale, getting in early could be the most prudent choice as you would buy the tokens at a lower price.</p>
<p>Regardless when you buy the tokens, you can maximize your rewards with a high staking APY of 500%. However, make sure to stake your tokens early as the APY will drop as more tokens are bought and staked.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Highly Promising Meme Token with $75m market cap after Huge Presale</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/visit/wallstreetmemes"><u>Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</u></a> is one of the hottest cryptos of 2023 &#8211; with a huge social media following over 1 million strong, it raised a whopping $25 million in its presale and has now grown to a $75 million market cap.</p>
<p>The token, which is available on multiple exchanges, looks set to be one of the biggest tokens in the next crypto bull run and is already massive in the meme coin space, trailing only Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe in daily trading volume. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/333416/wsm-all-time.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token price chart" /></figure>
<p>The project is known for having being tweeted about by Elon Musk, who is accredited with the prominent price rise of Dogecoin on many occasions. This project has a substantial internet presence and is looking to leverage its community to push for a $1 billion market capitalization.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes project launched at the end of May and enjoyed one of the best crypto presales ever. $WSM tokens were then listed on OKX on 26 September and saw a 275% jump within 4 days of listing despite launching in a bear market and at a time when BTC and ETH were dropping.</p>
<p>The theme of this campaign has to do with retail investors finally being able to get even with the Wall Street elites. Previous meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin enjoyed enormous success, though it must be said that these kinds of tokens also come with risks that need to be understood beforehand.  </p>
<p>Wall Street Memes further offers token staking and a generous $50,000 airdrop. Its collection of Ethereum NFTs sold out within minutes and this is an adaptable and versatile project that capitalizes on multiple initiatives. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/327283/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The total supply of 2,000,000,000 $WSM is entirely allocated to the community. The project is also offering generous staking rewards and, at the time of writing, more than 400 million tokens have been added to the staking pool &#8211; around 20% of the total supply &#8211; with an estimated APY of 40%.</p>
<p>Users can find more details on the project’s <a href="https://linktr.ee/wallstmemes"><u>Linktree</u></a> as well as on the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram group</u></a> to keep up to date with the latest developments on this new presale.</p>

<h3><strong>5. TG.Casino &#8211; Upcoming Crypto Casino Powered by Telegram Offering Staking and Buyback</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/en">TG.Casino</a> is an upcoming crypto casino that utilizes the power of Telegram to offer secure, instant and anonymous Web3 gaming. </p>
<p>New players use the messaging app to anonymously sign up to the casino, with no need for KYC verification, as well as instantly, securely and anonymously deposit and withdraw crypto with no fees.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/333420/tgcasino-750.jpg" alt="TG Casino token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The casino itself will also offer thousands of slots, classic casino games and a sportsbook, with new players able to get a welcome bonus of 150% matched first deposit, up to $30,000, plus 300 free spins.</p>
<p>The casino isn&#8217;t the only draw, however, with TG.Casino also offering a native token, $TGC, to offer holders more rewards. That includes staking, with the current APY estimated at 665%. </p>
<p>Staking tokens does not only generate rewards, though, with stakers also earning a share of casino profits from a token buyback and profit-sharing system. </p>
<p>Rollbit&#8217;s $RLB pumped 600% after it announced a buyback earlier this year, but $TGC will go a step further as the buyback will also have a burn mechanism &#8211; 60% of tokens are distributed to stakers as rewards and 40% are sent to a burn address.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/333421/tg-casino-rewards.jpg" alt="TG Casino tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>That makes $TGC deflationary and should increase its value over time. The token presale has raised around $750k so far. </p>

<h3><strong>6. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; Platform simplifying Web3 Investments with Real-time Insights</strong></h3>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/en"><u>Launchpad XYZ</u></a> launched the presale of its promising native LPX token. The platform offers users timely insights, such as public sentiment towards cryptos and other relevant social statistics. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/275750/screenshot-2023-05-16-at-.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ token presale page" /></figure>

<p>Before being listed on exchanges, LPX tokens can be purchased on the platform at a reduced rate.

<p>With the vision of becoming the epicenter of the Web3 business ecosystem, Launchpad XYZ is working on developing a decentralized exchange (DEX). This will facilitate frictionless trading on the platform.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/272445/launchpad-web3.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ web3 project" /></figure>
<p>The platform&#8217;s native LPX token has a multitude of utilities. By staking at least 10,000 LPX tokens, users qualify for discounts on products and services offered by Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s partners and early access to beta versions of premier P2P games. These premium services are accessible to those who stake a minimum of 10,000 LPX for 90 days, demonstrating the token&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>Another feature already up and running is the alpha Telegram signals group, which has provided multiple 1,000%-plus calls in recent weeks including a 7,000% call on LINQ.</p>

<h3><strong>7. eTukTuk &#8211; A Green Revolution For TukTuk Drivers in Underdeveloped Regions, Brand New Presale To Encourage Financial Inclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Despite the advancements in technology, the transportation sector still grapples with two significant issues – carbon emissions and financial exclusion.<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en"> </a></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en">eTukTuk (TUK)</a> is the world’s first automotive project built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain with the aim of empowering less developed countries and assisting the planet in the process. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/327290/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The project launches from the Capital of Sri Lanka (Colombo) and seeks to provide electrical vehicles that are more affordable and also more eco-friendly. Currently, TukTuk (a TukTuk is a three-wheeled vehicle that is commonly seen in Asian countries as a mode of transport) vehicles are far more damaging to the environment as compared to cars, with more CO2 emissions. It plans to launch efficient charging stations along with the new vehicles. </p>
<p>Moreover, it will assist TukTuk drivers transition from internal combustion vehicles, known for their high CO2 emissions. The project has received strong financial support from The Capital Maharaja Group. This organization holds a 20% equity stake in Sri Lankan operations. Sri Lanka has over 21 million people, over 1 million TukTuks, and a high pollution index, so this is a promising region to launch such an initiative.</p>
<p>The new vehicles can also help to make drivers more money, requiring far less maintenance and drastically reducing fuel costs. This is important in poorer regions. Drivers can also stake the token and earn rewards for using the TUK token within the application. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/327291/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk project home page" /></figure>
<p>eTukTuk is more than a transport project, but is a socio-economic tool to help people and the planet. It can make funds available to those who otherwise not be able to make a respectable living.  By combining sustainability, technology, and economics, it’s looking to set a standard for how industries should evolve in light of the facts of climate change. </p>
<p>The presale has just started with $80,000 raised so far &#8211; and a 40% discount on tokens &#8211; all the latest platform news can be found by joining the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>Telegram channel</u></a>.

<h3><strong>8. Chimpzee &#8211; An Immediate Action Campaign That Is Planting Trees &amp; Donating To Wildlife, $1.55 Million Raised in Presale</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/en"><u>Chimpzee (CHMPZ)</u></a> is not your run-of-the-mill project &#8211; it&#8217;s a serious campaign that has already made a substantial impact in terms of environmental contributions. So far, without the presale even being completed, it has already planted 1,200 trees to save the Brazilian rainforest, donated $15,000 to protect animals, and also planted 20,000 trees in Guatemala. </p>
<p>Its two primary aims, as demonstrated in the <a href="https://www.chimpzee.io/assets/chimpzeeWhitepaper.pdf"><u>whitepaper</u></a>, are to help nature and provide a way for investors to earn an income. It strikes an excellent balance between helping the planet and also incentivizing users to take part. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/327286/screen-shot-2023-08-31-at.jpg" alt="Chimpzee token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The whitepaper further outlines the damage being caused to rainforests and to specific species, and explains in dollar terms how little is required to help them to survive and thrive. The goal is immediate action without delay and to empower and motivate individuals to make a genuine difference. NFT staking rewards are up to 20%, depending on what type of NFT is purchased. </p>
<p>There is a total supply of 89 billion CHMPZ tokens, which is set to be reduced to 50 billion. Token burning can help to promote price appreciation. Of the total supply, 10% of the proceeds are given to charities concerned with the environment. </p>
<p>The current presale price is $0.00095 while the final listing price is set at $0.00185, a substantial difference. Investors can help the environment through Chimpzee while earning rewards from passive income. </p>
<p>More than $1.55 million has been raised at the time of writing.</p>

<h3><strong>11. Bitcoin &#8211; Promising Long-term Cryptocurrency Project</strong></h3>
<p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm"><u>best cryptocurrency</u></a> investments in the digital assets space, Bitcoin (BTC) is the largest and original cryptocurrency with a live market cap of $500 billion &#8211; 49% of the entire market.</p>
<p>Launched in 2009, this cryptocurrency was created by an alias that goes by the name of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ and has become one of the best performing financial assets ever. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-work-coins.htm"><u>best proof-of-work</u></a> coins, Bitcoin, is obtained by mining. Miners use large amounts of computational power to solve a complex algorithmic problem to earn new Bitcoin. With a limited supply of 21 million tokens, the cryptocurrency is deflationary.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/226469/bitcoin-imgs.jpg" alt="Bitcoin logo" /></figure>
<p>In November 2021, Bitcoin reached an ATH of nearly $70,000. However, 2022 was disappointing for the popular cryptocurrency and the widespread economic markets. </p>
<p>BTC enjoyed a strong first half of 2023, almost doubling in price and prices are predicted to rise further ahead of the next Bitcoin halving and amid institutional adoption, including spot Bitcoin ETFs from huge asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity.</p>
<p>Currently, BTC is trading at around $26k per token &#8211; 63% below the $70K highs &#8211; which could represent a decent potential entry point for many long-term investors. </p>
<p>While previous price history should not be used to consider future growth, Bitcoin has displayed a history of cyclical and boom-bust price action.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy BTC on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>12. Decentraland &#8211; Virtual Real Estate Cryptocurrency to Invest in 2023</strong></h3>
<p>The last few years have seen numerous NFT-based projects and use cases enter the digital assets space. </p>
<p>Decentraland has been one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the last few years &#8211; as it offers a metaverse-based virtual real-estate game where virtual plots of land can be bought or traded. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/226472/decentraland-home-ss.jpg" alt="Decentraland metaverse project" /></figure>
<p>Built on the Ethereum network, Decentraland features pieces of virtual land which are minted as ERC 721 smart contracts. The platform also offers Estates &#8211; which are NFTs representing combined pieces of digital land. These unique NFTs can be traded with MANA &#8211; an ERC-20 token and the native cryptocurrency of Decentraland. </p>
<p>In 2021, MANA increased from a price of $0.07 to an ATH of $5.90 &#8211; a price increase of more than 8,300%. </p>
<p>However, the sudden rise of multiple metaverse cryptocurrencies was followed by a huge price correction. Thus, the popular altcoin is now trading at $0.7127 per token. But, the metaverse is expected to reach a market cap of $5 trillion by 2030. </p>
<p>Since this space offers tradable NFTs by leveraging various decentralized finance elements, investors believe it to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm"><u>best future cryptocurrency</u></a> projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy MANA on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>13. Ethereum &#8211; Top Altcoin with new PoS Upgrade</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that deploys smart contracts to allow developers to create various decentralized finance (DeFi) products on its network. </p>
<p>Currently, Ethereum has the largest number of NFTs minted on its platform, making it one of the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-defi-coins.htm"><u> best DeFi coins</u></a> in the past few years, and is by far the biggest blockchain for decentralized app (dApp) builders, more than four times bigger than its nearest rival.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/226476/eth-pics.jpg" alt="Ethereum coin" /></figure>
<p>However, Ethereum has faced issues with high gas fees and slow trading times on its network. Therefore, the cryptocurrency recently underwent a network upgrade, allowing it to adopt the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. With the PoS consensus, Ethereum will offer high throughput &#8211; allowing a large number of transactions to be conducted every second. </p>
<p>One of the most promising cryptocurrencies to buy, Ethereum, reached an ATH of $4,900 in November 2021. Like Bitcoin its current price &#8211; around 65% below its all-time high &#8211; could mark a good entry point for buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy ETH on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>14. Polygon &#8211; Layer-2 Scaling Solution on Ethereum</strong></h3>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is a layer-2 scaling solution built on the Ethereum network. This cryptocurrency is used as a scaling solution for Ethereum. </p>
<p>Polygon uses Optimistic Rollups &#8211; which makes Ethereum more scalable and a multi-chain system. Polygon can reach around 65,000 transactions-per-second (TPS), way faster than the likes of Visa, which has a max TPS of 24,000.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/226478/polygon-home.jpg" alt="Polygon Layer 2 blockchain" /></figure>
<p>MATIC is Polygon&#8217;s native cryptocurrency and governance token and are used as a payment service on Polygon, as well as being leveraged by users to operate within the Polygon network. With a quick block time of under 2 seconds, over 50 dApps have been built on Polygon. </p>
<p>Trading at $0.01 in January 2021, MATIC reached an all-time high of $2.92 in December of the same year &#8211; a staggering 29,100% price increase. Currently, MATIC has a price of $0.54 and a market cap of $5 billion. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy MATIC on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>15. XRP &#8211; Global Payments Provider to Invest in 2023</strong></h3>
<p>Ripple is a blockchain-based payment service and global network which is used by banks and financial institutions. This platform offers global transactions by leveraging its native cryptocurrency &#8211; XRP. </p>
<p>While traditional finance offers low-speed processing times, XRP leverages blockchain technology to facilitate quick transactions in 3-5 seconds. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/226482/ripple-xrp.jpg" alt="Ripple coin" /></figure>
<p>With a low cost of $0.0002 per transaction and the ability to handle more than 1,500 transactions per second, XRP is a promising cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. After launching in 2013 at $0.0059, XRP reached an ATH of $3.84 in 2018. However, XRP has declined to a price of $0.50 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Due to this cryptocurrency&#8217;s alternative benefits, more than 300+ financial institutions have partnered with XRP to transfer funds globally. However, much of XRP&#8217;s price has been stifled by an ongoing court battle with the SEC &#8211; despite a recent victory, parent company Ripple Labs are not yet clear of more court appearances.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy XRP on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>16. Binance Coin &#8211; Governance Token of a Global Cryptocurrency Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange &#8211; a global cryptocurrency trading platform with more than 600 digital assets.</p>
<p>After being created on the Ethereum network, BNB is now deployed on the Binance Smart Chain &#8211; which can handle more than 60 transactions per second (TPS). This is more than 3 times greater than Ethereum’s average of 17 TPS. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/226487/bnb-token.jpg" alt="BNB coin" /></figure>
<p>The largest exchange in terms of trading volume, Binance offers low trading fees, referral programmes and leverage trading opportunities for users. By leveraging the BNB token, Binance users can access further discounts. For example, Binance customers holding a certain amount of BNB can gain a 25% discount on spot trading fees. </p>
<p>Thus, the popularity of Binance has allowed BNB to stay competitive. BNB has a current price of $270, with a market cap of $44 billion. Despite correcting by 60% since its ATH, BNB is still the fourth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap.</p>
<p>However, investors should note that Binance has been hit with sanctions and lawsuits in numerous territories around the world which could stifle the growth of the token.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy BNB on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>17. Dogecoin &#8211; Meme Coin with High-Growth Potential </strong></h3>
<p>Launched in 2013, Dogecoin was based as a joke on the popular Doge meme. However, social media backing and support from celebrities such as Mark Cuban and Elon Musk have made Dogecoin one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm"><u>best meme coins</u></a> to trade. </p>
<p>Just like Bitcoin, DOGE can be accessed via mining activities. The cryptocurrency uses scrypt technology, which allows investors to access DOGE. However, this particular asset has an unlimited token supply, with a circulating supply of more than 132 billion coins. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90362/226491/dogecoin-home.jpg" alt="Dogecoin cryptocurrency" /></figure>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-dogecoin.htm">Is it too late to buy Dogecoin</a>? After receiving backing from Elon Musk on Twitter in the last few years, DOGE has become one of the biggest digital assets in the space. From a price of $0.004 in January 2021, DOGE reached a high of $0.70 in the same year. This staggering price rise of 17,400% led to the development of multiple other meme projects, such as Shiba Inu and Dogelon Mars. </p>
<p>However, Dogecoin has corrected by over 90% since its ATH &#8211; with a live price of $0.063 per token. Since this cryptocurrency regularly attracts high levels of volatility, it may be a potential investment opportunity for high-risk high-reward-seeking investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy DOGE on eToro</a>

<h2><strong>How to Find Highly Promising Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When looking for new promising crypto projects in 2023, investors can look at a variety of factors and indicators to determine their next investments. Here are a few techniques to help you find the most promising cryptocurrency to trade right now: </p>
<h3><strong>Platform Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Analyzing a project’s use cases is a great way to identify promising cryptocurrency investments for the future. </p>
<p>Many thousands of different cryptos exist with many thousands of different use cases, which are also referred to as utility.</p>
<p>On this list, for example, yPredict is an AI-powered trading terminal, Launchpad XYZ is a gateway platform for Web3 users and Chimpzee is allowing crypto investors to also invest in eco-friendly projects and sustainable programs that help preserve nature and wildlife. </p>
<p>Some cryptocurrency projects are networks and blockchains that other protocols are built upon, with the likes of Ethereum and Polygon filling this void.</p>
<p>Different projects will have different goals and ambitions and, on the other hand, the likes of Dogecoin and other meme tokens exist purely as speculative investment vehicles and come with more risk.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, ironically, offers very little utility beyond being used sparingly as a payment but as it is considered the &#8216;safest&#8217; crypto it has found a niche as a store of value and has been referred to as &#8216;digital gold&#8217;.</p>
<h2><strong>Social Media Backing </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Apart from platform utility, marketing is an important feature that cryptocurrencies leverage. For example, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm"><u>best shitcoins</u></a>, such as Dogecoin, have a huge social media presence with more than 2.3 million subscribers on the r/dogecoin Reddit group. </p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is another project that has built a substantial social media following and leveraged that to raise $25 million during its presale. As a high visibility project that also has the attention of Elon Musk, it is expected to grow further once the $WSM token reaches exchanges at the end of September.</p>
<p>Furthermore, social media followings and sentiment is a great way to weed out projects that should be avoided &#8211; social media sites can be checked to see whether a project is worth investing in based on what others are saying.</p>
<h2><strong>Most Promising Time to Buy Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When is the best time to invest in the most promising crypto assets? Do you know what the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-during-the-bear-market.htm">best crypto to buy in the bear market</a> is? The sections below discuss when investors can pick up new cryptocurrency assets for profitable future returns. </p>
<h3><strong>Cryptocurrency Presales</strong></h3>
<p>The most promising cryptocurrency assets may not display a staggering market cap at current levels. Since many investors are looking for profitable cryptocurrencies which will offer long-term gains, investing in cryptocurrency presales may be the best possible time to enter into new holdings. </p>
<p>Presales often offer tokens at a discounted prices, allowing those who get in early to make gains when the token is initially listed on an exchange.</p>
<h3><strong>New Exchange Listings</strong></h3>
<p>The most promising digital assets are the ones that everyone wants to get their hands on. Therefore, they must be made available on the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. Once a cryptocurrency is listed on popular exchanges, it drives customer interest and can increase trading volumes.</p>
<p>As the number of listings increases, instant access to a new consumer base has the potential to move prices. </p>
<p>In the crypto space this has been referred to as the &#8216;Coinbase&#8217; or &#8216;Binance effect&#8217; as tokens get a huge boost when it is announced they will list on major exchanges &#8211; with investors anticipating an influx of new investment amid the excitement.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The most promising cryptos offer unique benefits and use cases, attracting more investors to look at their projects. Bitcoin ETF Token stands out as the most promising of all cryptos on the list for many different reasons.</p>
<p>The token is designed to reward holders based on events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC by burning 5% of the token supply with each milestone. There&#8217;s also a generous staking APY and you can buy the token at a price of $0.0052 at the moment.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Meme Kombat &#8211; Wager on Fighting Meme Coin Avatars on an AI-Focused Battle Arena, Stake $MK to Earn a 112% APY</strong></h3>
<p>The next gaming coin to watch is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK). This is a new meme cryptocurrency that leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to offer a play-to-earn battle arena. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88321/331529/meme-kombat-home.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat crypto presale" /></figure>
<p>The first season of the battle arena will launch by Q3 2023 and feature 11 popular meme coin avatars. $MK Token holders can wager their tokens on live battles and earn multiple rewards and free tokens. Users can challenge their friends in the Player vs Player mode and wager tokens to earn huge profits. </p>
<p>On Meme Kombat, users can also win exciting NFTs. Investors can stand a chance to win the free NFTs by purchasing at least $5K worth of tokens through the ongoing presale. From a low supply of just 12 million, 6 million tokens have been allocated for the presale. Currently, $MK is priced at just $1.667 per token. </p>
<p>Once you purchase the tokens on the presale, your holdings will be automatically staked through a staking contract. At press time, the Meme Kombat staking contract is offering a 112% APY. To earn the presale APYs, one must re-stake their tokens after the presale ends. The minimum lock-up period is only 14 days. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88321/331527/meme-kombat-apy.jpg" alt="$MK staking APY" /></figure>

<h3><strong>5. Tamadoge &#8211; Popular Gaming Crypto to Invest in 2023</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge</a> (TAMA) is the native cryptocurrency of the Tamaverse &#8211; a play-to-earn (P2E) ecosystem leveraging tradable NFT protocols, allowing players to monetize their gaming experience.</p>
<p>With the introduction of &#8216;To The Moon,&#8217; Tamadoge, the successful play-to-earn gaming platform, has once again captured the attention of gamers. This is the third game in the Tamadoge arcade lineup, which has seen thousands of hours of total playtime.</p>
<p>One of the top crypto gaming coins, TAMA is used to purchase Tamadoge pets &#8211; virtual dog-like avatars which can be purchased on the Tama store. These pets are used in community-wide competitions, allowing the top players to earn TAMA as a reward. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88321/252851/tamadoge-run.jpg" alt="Tamadoge P2E crypto game" /></figure>
<p>With a total of just 2 billion coins, TAMA has one of the smallest circulating supplies in the meme coin space. Concluding one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>best crypto presales</u></a> in 2022, Tamadoge raised $19 million in 8 weeks and then pumped to an all-time high of $0.194 in late 2022.</p>
<p>The price has since retraced but a breakout year is expected with its main game, two arcade-style mini-games and an Augmented Reality (AR) Tamadoge app &#8211; retaining the same P2E dynamics as the web-based platform &#8211; on the way in 2023.</p>
<p>The supply will also soon be subject to a 5% burn, decreasing the number of tokens and increasing their value &#8211; with all purchases in the pet store subject to the burn.</p>
<p>All told, we expect Tamadoge to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>fastest growing cryptocurrencies</u></a> in 2023. </p>

<h2><strong>What are Gaming Tokens &amp; GameFi Cryptos?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The term GameFi is the combination of two words &#8211; gaming and finance. Gaming-based cryptocurrency projects aim to incentivize players by providing in-game earning opportunities on their platform.</p>
<p>By leveraging blockchain technology, developers offer GameFi elements such as P2E &amp; tradable NFT avatars, tokenized rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies and more. Many such projects offer GameFi cryptos &#8211; which usually provide two benefits. </p>
<p>Firstly, the cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase in-game items and take part in events. On the other hand, the top performers can earn the GameFi cryptos as rewards &#8211; allowing players to monetize their time spent on the gaming ecosystem.</p>
<h2><strong>Are GameFi Cryptocurrencies a Good Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Looking to invest in the top GameFi cryptos? Before investing in the playable digital assets, let’s look at some of the reasons that make this sector a good investment. </p>
<h3><strong>Earn Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain gaming offers a simple solution &#8211; in-game rewards &#8211; for gamers looking to monetize their activities. Most of the GameFi projects attract investors due to the potential rewards that can be received via NFTs, cryptocurrencies or special prizes. </p>
<p>For example, Fight Out allows for several ways for players to generate active and passive revenue streams.</p>
<p>On Tamadoge, players leverage their pet NFTs to compete for points on a monthly points table. The top performers are rewarded with TAMA &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. </p>
<h3><strong>Potential for Long-Term Growth</strong></h3>
<p>The blockchain gaming sector saw investors pour in more than $2.5 billion in Q1 2022. With the growing popularity of web3, developers are leveraging blockchain technology to discover new use cases. GameFi tokens like Battle Infinity provided use cases for NFTs &#8211; incorporating these non-fungible assets as playable avatars in the metaverse game and offering NFT passes for investors to join their P2E ecosystems. </p>
<p>With the GameFi sector expected to be worth $50 billion by 2025, most of the above-mentioned cryptos may experience higher price evaluations in the long-term. Therefore, traders can diversify their portfolios by entering the crypto gaming sector right now. </p>

<p>This how to buy Cogwise guide and presale review will analyze all the features of this AI-driven model. Cogwise will offer blockchain developers premium trading insights and support by leveraging multiple AI concepts, such as machine learning and Natural Language Processing. </p>
<p>Our guide will also review $COGW, the native token, which is used for staking benefits, yield farming and gives access to the Cogwise AI models. Read more to find out how to buy Cogwise through the ongoing presale. </p>
<h2><strong>Cogwise Crypto: What is It? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cogwise.io/">Cogwise</a> is a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) model that leverages blockchain technology and machine learning tools to offer sophisticated trading insights.</p>
<p>This cryptocurrency platform will give users access to advanced models and services such as smart contract auditors, technical analysis charts, wallet tracking options, and no-code smart contract generators. Cogwise aims to help users identify trends and predict market movements to make profitable trades. </p>
<p>At the center of the Cogwise ecosystem is $COGW, the native cryptocurrency. With the $COGW token, users can access the premium AI models supported at Cogwise. In the future, Cogwise will be an open-source community where AI developers can share their models. The platform can communicate and understand human inputs by leveraging tools such as Natural Language Processing (NLP). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125914/332470/cogwise-home-img.jpg" alt="Cogwise web3 platform" /></figure>
<p>The $COGW token will also give token holders access to multiple earning opportunities. Cogwise is working on a gamification and rewards system through which token holders can accumulate tokens over time. This token will also reduce in supply with its burning mechanism &#8211; a feature that can help the token soar in price.</p>
<p>On Cogwise, users can leverage features such as the smart contract generator. Through this utility, users with no coding knowledge can create smart contracts by inputting information on the system. The platform supports contract auditors and will also feature news aggregators that constantly analyze important information related to the crypto space. </p>

<h2><strong>Cogwise: Key Components</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at some of the key components of this cryptocurrency project: </p>
<h3><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></h3>
<p>While AI is developing significant attraction recently, it is important to get it right. Cogwise’s entire AI-based model is based on understanding human inputs. Therefore, this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> leverages Natural Language Processing to analyze and process the human language. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125914/332472/cogwise-nlp.jpg" alt="CogwiseAI Core features" /></figure>
<p>With NLP, computers can also produce and communicate in a way that is understandable to humans. The Cogwise chatbot will respond to users in a way that is helpful and pertinent to the task at hand. NLP is also leveraged so that the computers offer contextual awareness. The responses will be prompt, and the computer will analyze past conversations to understand the context of the conversation. </p>
<p>NLP has been used to build the CogwiseAI Core, a conversational AI-powered assistant. The assistant will help with various tasks, including smart contract programming, market analysis, guidance, and trading. </p>
<h3><strong>Cogwise Engine </strong></h3>
<p>The Cogwise engine is another integral component of this cryptocurrency platform. The engine studies various data points to reason and draw out conclusions that can help make trading insights. </p>
<p>This engine possesses a deterministic nature that can guarantee accurate AI inference results. All these capabilities make Cogwise attractive to developers for building smart contracts and DApps (Decentralized Applications). The engine also helps enhance the platform’s performance and scalability &#8211; making it a lucrative solution for businesses delving into the AI and blockchain space. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">top utility token</a> also supports on-chain solutions, making it a reliable platform. Thus, users can access real-time trading insights through an AI trading assistant, which helps with technical analysis. The assistant analyzes historical prices and detects new chart patterns to help make new trades. </p>
<p>The capabilities of the engine also include a wallet tracking system. This system tracks large wallet transactions by monitoring the trading activity. </p>
<h2><strong>Is COGW Token a Worthwhile Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While we have analyzed the multiple features of Cogwise, let’s also take a deeper look at the $COGW token. After going through these points, we will determine whether this cryptocurrency is a worthwhile investment option: </p>
<h3><strong>Staking Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the $COGW token is used to get access to the premium features of the AI model. Cogwise supports a staking mechanism through which token holders can lock up their tokens for a certain amount of time. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125914/332475/cogwise-features.jpg" alt="Cogwise ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">best staking coins</a>, $COGW, can be staked to access premium AI models on Cogwise, such as trading insights, smart contract generation, wallet tracking, and more. The platform states that the AI model can be accessed by staking at least 10,000 $COGW tokens. Since $COGW is currently priced at $0.02 per presale, this amount tallies to a live price of just $200. </p>
<p>Staking $COGW will also help users receive priority services. The token can be a worthwhile investment to AI developers and traders seeking knowledge and insights into the AI premium models. </p>
<h3><strong>Farming and Liquidity Generation</strong></h3>
<p>Through the yield farming feature, $COGW token holders can help provide liquidity to the ecosystem. Token holders can provide liquidity to $COGW on other decentralized exchanges by depositing their tokens in a liquidity pool. </p>
<p>Notably, depositing your tokens in this pool will help you generate passive income. As your deposited tokens are used to swap with other tokens on decentralized exchanges, you will earn a percentage as profits. The rewards earned are proportional to the number of tokens you have deposited in the liquidity pool. This is a good way to earn free $COGW tokens while contributing to the ecosystem. </p>
<h3><strong>Rewards System </strong></h3>
<p>Cogwise is developing an entire rewards and gamification system to reward long-term token holders and platform users. As users leverage the AI consultant on Cogwise, they will earn $COGW tokens for simply interacting with the system. </p>
<p>Cogwise will launch an online leaderboard displaying the top members who have earned the most tokens depending on the activities they finish and the tasks they complete. Collecting a certain amount of tokens on the leaderboard will move up different reward tier levels, increasing your earnings. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125914/332477/screen-shot-2023-10-03-at.jpg" alt="Cogwise gamification system" /></figure>
<p>For example, users could earn a few tokens on the basic tiers. As you progress higher, you can win large rewards and get access to complex AI features in the ecosystem. The reward system will also start distributing seasonal rewards. This will offer attractive promotions for a short time period &#8211; attracting new users to the ecosystem. </p>
<p>The platform will also include a social sharing feature to reward those who share experiences with Cogwise across social media channels. Feedback reward systems and challenges will also be introduced to attract investors. This system is an exciting proposition since long-term investors can earn free tokens for their time spent on Cogwise. </p>
<h3><strong>$COGW Burning Mechanism </strong></h3>
<p>Another factor that makes $COGW a good investment is its burning mechanism. Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> and meme tokens have an unlimited token supply. This reduces the price growth in the long term, as the supply is higher than the demand. </p>
<p>$COGW has a maximum supply of only 1 billion tokens. However, the project will start burning tokens to make $COGW a more profitable investment in the future. 35% of all the profits and revenues generated on the Cogwise will be burned. This cut will be applicable for any sort of revenue generated with the use of the $COGW token. </p>
<p>Thus, if the popularity of the token increases, the low supply can help push the token price upwards. </p>

<div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration: none;color: white" href="https://cogwise.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">Visit Cogwise</a></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What makes Cogwise Unique?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While multiple AI platforms exist in the blockchain space, Cogwise is developing an all-around ecosystem that provides a little bit for all its stakeholders. To leverage AI to assist with trading ideas, the platform will use machine learning and NLP to communicate with humans. </p>
<p>Thus, this simplifies trading for beginner traders with no experience. While features such as smart alerts and real-time trading are suitable for traders, developers can also take advantage of other components of Cogwise, such as smart contract generators, on-chain features, and wallet tracking devices. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125914/332478/cogwise-security.jpg" alt="Cogwise security" /></figure>
<p>To protect the platform against cyber threats and attacks, Cogwise has implemented multiple security protocols. The platform will use secure cryptographic primitives and encrypted communication to protect the users. Furthermore, private keys will be securely stored on the platform. Cogwise will also be compatible with hardware wallets. </p>
<p>If all these features were not enough, the $COGW token displays unique and multiple use cases that make it an attractive proposition. As discussed earlier, the token can be used for staking purposes and to earn passive income through the farming mechanism. In the long term, the $COGW token will also decrease in supply through the burning mechanism. </p>
<p>For all these reasons, Cogwise ($COGW) has the potential to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best cryptocurrency investments in the long term</a>. </p>
<h2><strong>Who is behind Cogwise? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Unlike most cryptocurrency projects, the Cogwise team has made themselves public. This is a good sign in the cryptocurrency space since it helps garner the public&#8217;s trust. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125914/332479/cogwise-founders.jpg" alt="Cogwise team" /></figure>
<p>Delroy Maurie, the CEO and Founder, has a background in computer science and is striving to bring more innovative solutions by leveraging the capabilities of AI technology. Other team members, such as Mathias Niemann (Chief Technology Officer) and Bethel Douglas (Chief Operating Officer), have experience working in the blockchain space. </p>
<h2><strong>Cogwise Presale </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To leverage all the capabilities and use cases of the $COGW token, interested investors can buy this cryptocurrency through the ongoing presale. As mentioned above, $COGW has a total supply of 1 billion. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125914/332481/cogwise-tokenomics.jpg" alt="Cogwise tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The ongoing token presale has allocated 40% of the token supply &#8211; 400 million tokens. Currently, $COGW is priced at just $0.02 per token. Since the presale started, Cogwise has already sold 15.8 million tokens &#8211; raising more than $167K. By purchasing $COGW at the current price, investors can get a hold of the tokens before the price increases. </p>
<p>The $COGW listing price is set at $0.065 per token &#8211; a 225% price increase from current levels. By the end of the presale, Cogwise aims to raise $15.35 million. After the end of the presale, the <a href="https://cogwise.io/whitepaper-cogwise-COGW.pdf">Cogwise whitepaper</a> states that 12% of the token supply will be reserved for future CEX (Centralized Exchange) and DEX (Decentralized Exchange) listings. </p>

<p>Therefore, investors can buy the token at the early levels before the initial exchange offering takes place. </p>

<h3><strong>Step 2: Buy ETH/USDT Tokens</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>Best Methods to Earn Cryptocurrency Reviewed </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Wondering how to earn crypto? The sections below analyze some of the top methods to earn with digital assets. </p>
<p>From earning high APY (Annual Percentage Yield) with the best crypto interest accounts to winning multiple cryptocurrency giveaways, here are the best ways to earn free cryptocurrency rewards. <b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Earn Up to 500% in Annual Staking Yields with Bitcoin ETF Token </b></h3>
<p>One of the best ways to earn free crypto is with $BTCETF &#8211; the native cryptocurrency of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a>. This new cryptocurrency can be staked to earn high staking yields. Furthermore, the token is available to buy during the early phases of its presale. </p>
<p><iframe title="New BTC ETF 10X Potential Crypto?! | Bitcoin Alternative With Staking Rewards!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/17pXZtSNHDM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Currently, $BTCETF is priced at only $0.0052 per token on presale. The presale is allocating 840 million tokens &#8211; representing 40% of the total 2.1 billion token supply. By the end of the presale, Bitcoin ETF Token aims to raise almost $5 million. </p>
<p>A further 25% of the token supply will be distributed through staking rewards. Bitcoin ETF Token speculates the upcoming arrival of a Bitcoin ETF, and will offer staking rewards and burn tokens as the Bitcoin ETF’s release schedule progresses. </p>
<p>This cryptocurrency has been created to celebrate the arrival of the Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) and will reward long-term investors. Once the Bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 5% of its supply. Another 5% will be burned when the ETF is released. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130278" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token staking" width="900" height="297" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm.png 1329w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm-300x99.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm-1024x337.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699871094-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-12-17-28-pm-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Thus, loyal investors can earn from a pool of staking rewards. Furthermore, as the tokens start to burn, $BTCETF can potentially increase in price. To earn passive income, investors can stake $BTCETF and earn annual yields as high as 500%. So far, more than 55 million tokens have already been locked on Bitcoin ETF Token’s smart contract. </p>
<p>Since the start of the presale, Bitcoin ETF Token has raised $500K in under one week. Once the presale ends, $BTCETF will be listed on crypto exchanges.

<h3><strong>2. Earn Cloud Mining Credits and Staking Returns with Bitcoin Minetrix</strong></h3>
<p>Another way to earn free cryptocurrency is by leveraging the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> platform. This revolutionary cryptocurrency project is tokenizing the cloud mining space. In recent times, third-party cloud mining corporations have recently been scamming investors by performing dubious activities. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/332050/bitcoin-minetrix-184k-raised.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is solving this problem by decentralizing the process. By leveraging $BTCMTX, the native cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Minetrix will offer tokenized ERC-20 cloud mining credits. Since these are recorded on the blockchain, there is no chance of fraud. Users will have more autonomy over their credits. </p>
<p>To access these credits, you must first buy and stake $BTCMTX. Currently, Bitcoin Minetrix is allocating 2.8 billion tokens across ten presale rounds. This represents 70% of the total 4 billion token supply. The $BTCMTX token is priced at only $0.011 during the first presale round. The price will increase to $0.0119 by the final round. </p>
<p>Presale investors can instantly stake their holdings through the Ethereum-powered smart contract. The platform promises to offer high staking rewards. You will also collect the cloud mining credits by staking tokens. You can burn your credits on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin mining power. This will be used to earn allocated mining time, which will get you a share of mining revenues. </p>

<p>Therefore, this cryptocurrency platform will make cloud mining cost-effective and more transparent. Bitcoin Minetrix has raised more than $180K in a few days since the presale launched.

<h3><strong>3. Lock and Earn Huge Staking APYs and Community Rewards with Meme Kombat</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) is an exciting meme cryptocurrency platform that will feature a play-to-earn battle arena and a staking mechanism. $MK, the native cryptocurrency, is available to buy for just $1.667 through the ongoing presale. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86643/331359/screen-shot-2023-09-25-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" /></figure>

<p>To collect the staking rewards from the presale, users must re-stake their tokens at least once after the presale ends. Tokens only need to be locked-up for a minimum of 14 days. The <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper/">Meme Kombat whitepaper</a> states that some of the staked tokens can also be used to bet on the battle arena. </p>
<p>Meme Kombat’s battle arena will be released after the presale ends. The arena will feature battles between different meme coin avatars. Users can challenge their friends into Player vs Player battles, and lay wagers on their fights to earn free $MK tokens. The same can be done on the Player vs Game mode. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/331383/meme-kombat-presale-live.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat presale" /></figure>

<h3><strong>4. eTukTuk &#8211; Earn 33,487% APY And Help The Planet With eTukTuk’s Multi-Utility Token</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> is a campaign based in Sri Lanka, that has two core aims. The first is to remedy socio economic barriers. The second is to help the environment by reducing CO2 emissions from environmentally unfriendly vehicles. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/332152/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token staking" /><br /> </p>
<p>It aims to do this through the introduction of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), which will replace TukTuks. TukTuks are a form of 3-wheeled vehicle common in parts of Asia. But they are very problematic for the environment, emitting more CO2 than regular cars. The new ZEVs will be powered through electric, at designated charging stations.</p>
<p>This means that drivers won’t have to use any of their returns for fuel. The vehicles are also much more affordable than existing TukTuks and drivers manage their earnings and their route right from the dashboard. The routes will be optimized by AI, to further help in terms of energy conservation. AI will also assist in terms of long term vehicle maintenance, so nothing goes to waste.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/332153/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token presale page" /><br /> </p>
<p>Drivers and retail investors can also benefit from huge yields, which currently sit at 33,487%. This is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) project. This blockchain was selected due to being more eco-friendly, as well as faster and lower cost than the competition. The TUK token further supports green transportation through AI research. </p>
<p>Sri Lanka currently has a poor carbon footprint, and this initiative is meant to bring it up to speed. But electric vehicles are not in play even in developed countries, so this campaign would put it on the map in a global context, if it was implemented at the national level. It is also intended to be a means of banking the unbanked, solving a large number of problems through one unified ecosystem.</p>
<p><br /><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/332154/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk network expansion" /></p>
<p>The price per token is $0.024, thought this will likely increase as the presale progresses further. This is a multi-utility token used to earn high APY, bank the unbanked, and facilitate transactions within the wider ecosystem.</p>
<p>More information can be found in the project socials (<a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>Telegram</u></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TukToken"><u>Twitter</u></a>) as well as the official <a href="https://etuktuk.io/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Whitepaper</u></a>. </p>
<p>This project has further undertaken a <a href="https://coinsult.net/projects/etuktuk/"><u>smart contract audit</u></a>, with no issues found.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Earn Free Tokens By Staking On The Wall Street Memes Platform, Presale Complete</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> (WSM) offers high staking yields and user traction.</p>
<p>Originating from the successful Wall St Bulls Ethereum NFT collection introduced in 2021, WSM has a massive social media following—surpassing one million. The presale has already secured over $25 million and will list on top exchanges by month&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Staking your $WSM tokens allows you to earn rewards based on the Wall Street Memes ecosystem. The rewards you receive are calculated by considering two factors: your percentage stake in the $WSM pool and the project&#8217;s annual percentage yield, currently set at 68%.</p>
<p>Rewards are given out per block, currently at a rate of 75 WSM. Notably, the pool&#8217;s total amount of staked tokens has already exceeded 293 million, showing strong community backing.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/93044/328719/screenshot-2023-09-08-at-.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token staking" /></figure>
<p>Moreover, the platform&#8217;s broad reach is evident. Even celebrities like Elon Musk have engaged with its content, highlighting its viral presence.</p>
<p>The $WSM token pool comprises 2 billion tokens, with plans to distribute them entirely within the community. </p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes whitepaper</u></a>, half of this supply was reserved for the presale, and the rest is split between rewarding the community and liquidity provisioning. Through the $WSM presale, Wall Street Memes raised more than $25 million. The token is now trading on popular crypto exchanges such as OKX and Huobi. </p>
<p>Such a community-centric token distribution eliminates the risk of a potential rug pull in the market.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Earn Free Crypto Tokens with Tamadoge on ByBit</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge </a>(TAMA) is a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>new cryptocurrency</u></a> project and the native token of the Tamaverse &#8211; a play-to-earn (P2E) ecosystem offering in-game earning opportunities to investors. After purchasing TAMA tokens, the community members can purchase playable NFT avatars known as ‘Tamadoge Pets’. </p>
<p>These NFTs are minted using smart contract functionality and can be grown and bred by purchasing other virtual items from the Tama store. Eventually, Tamadoge pets can be used in community-wide competitions to earn points on a monthly leaderboard. The top performers are rewarded with free Tamadoge crypto. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/224780/tama-okx-free-crypto.jpg" alt="Tamadoge token promotion" /></figure>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge</a> has already conducted crypto giveaways worth $100K to presale investors to promote this crypto project. After completing one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>best crypto presales</u></a> in 2022, Tamadoge raised $19 million in just over 8 weeks. The price of TAMA increased from $0.01 to $0.03 by the end of the round &#8211; a 300% price increase. </p>
<p>Following the announcement, Tamadoge was listed on OKX &#8211; a global multi-asset trading platform with more than 20 million traders. On September 26th, TAMA began trading on the OKX centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchange (DEX) &#8211; making it available to investors, regardless of geographical regulations.</p>
<p>On OKX, Tamadoge is offering investors the opportunity to earn free crypto rewards. Users must sign up with OKX, complete the KYC Level 1 and trade the TAMA/USDT pair (no minimum trade size). After completing this, investors will win $10. </p>
<p>Along with the opportunity to earn free crypto, Tamadoge (TAMA) has the potential to become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm"><u>best long term</u></a> cryptocurrency projects. The token offers a maximum supply of 2 billion tokens, making it a deflationary asset. Furthermore, 5% of all TAMA spent on the ecosystem will be burnt. </p>
<p>Thus, the token will increase demand against the supply, potentially making it more valuable in the long run. According to the <a href="https://tamadoge.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Tamadoge-Whitepaper-V1-EN-1.pdf"><u>Tamadoge whitepaper</u></a>, the platform plans to implement an AR-based P2E app and a P2E-arcade game and make strategic metaverse partnerships in the coming years.</p>
<p>Currently, Tamadoge (TAMA) is trading on the OKX exchange at $0.073 per token &#8211; more than a 700% price increase since its presale launch price. Tamadoge will also be listed on MEXC exchange and LBank on 5th October 2022. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Earn 25% APY on the Battle Infinity Ecosystem </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> (IBAT) has emerged as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-games.htm"><u>best metaverse games</u></a> in 2023 &#8211; offering several in-game earning opportunities in its virtual ecosystem. The platform allows players to access the Battle Arena &#8211; a virtual ecosystem where all characters and avatars are minted as NFTs, using ERC 721 smart contracts. </p>
<p>Players can update their virtual avatars on Battle Infinity’s NFT marketplace and access the metaverse reality via VR headsets. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-earn-games.htm"><u>best play-to-earn crypto</u></a> games, Battle Infinity offers an NFT-based sports fantasy league where players can earn rewards with IBAT &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. IBAT tokens can be accessed and swapped with other cryptos on the IBAT Battle Swap &#8211; Battle Infinity’s decentralized exchange. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/224781/ibat-4-million-staked.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity staking rewards" /></figure>
<p>Notably, the cryptocurrency exchange’s new staking platform offers investors free to earn cryptocurrency. In September 2022, Battle Infinity launched the IBAT Battle Stake &#8211; the staking platform where IBAT can be deposited to earn potentially high APY. </p>
<p>2 days after the launch, Battle Infinity witnessed over $3 million worth of tokens locked on the staking protocol. Players can access flexible staking &#8211; which offers 12% APY and allows you to withdraw your tokens at any time. </p>
<p>The locked staking option lets players earn higher yields by locking up IBAT. For example, a 30-day lock-up results in 14% APY, while you can earn 17% for 90 days of staking. The yield increases to 20% and 25% for 180 days and 360 days lock-up, respectively. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm"><u>best proof of stake</u></a> platforms, more than 10% of the 10 billion maximum supply of IBAT deposited on the Battle Stake. Currently, over $4 million worth of IBAT has been staked on Battle Infinity&#8217;s staking protocol.</p>
<p>As the staked amount increase, the reduced supply of tokens can potentially lead to a higher price movement. The coin&#8217;s popularity increased as it collected 16,500 BNB worth of IBAT in 24 days of the presale. After being listed on presale for only $0.0015, IBAT is trading on PancakeSwap at $0.0035.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Battle Infinity</a>
<h3><strong>10. Use Cryptocurrency Interest Accounts</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-interest-accounts.htm">Cryptocurrency interest accounts</a> act similar to saving accounts &#8211; deposit different crypto assets and earn interest on your holdings. Therefore, long-term holders that want to hold their digital assets can leverage these services to earn free rewards. </p>
<p>One popular cryptocurrency account is Aqru &#8211; crypto savings account that offers high APY returns on popular assets such as Bitcoin. Aqru offers 7% APY on Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering lucrative passive income earning opportunities. Notably, Aqru also lets investors earn interest on stablecoins such as USD coins and DAI &#8211; with a 12% APY.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/224785/aqru-staking.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency interest rewards" /></figure>
<p>Notably, the interest earned on Aqru does not differ per deposit. Many exchanges offer differing APY depending on the amount deposited, but Aqru supports free crypto-earning opportunities without any limits. Furthermore, with Aqru, investors do not need to lock up their cryptocurrencies for a specified amount of time. </p>
<p>Investors can access other cryptocurrency interest accounts from platforms such as BlockFi, Binance and Crypto.com. </p>
<h3><strong>11. Earn Cryptocurrency Rewards with Credit/Debit Cards</strong></h3>
<p>Regular cryptocurrency traders can benefit by purchasing cryptocurrency credit and debit cards. With a crypto debit or credit card, investors can convert popular assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and more to fiat currency at merchant points. This process can also be conducted at specific ATMs where VISA and MasterCard are supported. </p>
<p>Therefore, the crypto cards can be used to purchase goods and services, even if the particular outlet or merchant does not support direct crypto payments. In such instances, the merchant at the other end of the transaction does not have to accept the payment in cryptocurrency since the providers handle the exchange process. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/224786/crypto-com-visa-card-tiers.jpg" alt="Earn crypto with a credit card" /></figure>
<p>Importantly, cryptocurrency credit and debit cards can give holders cashback rewards &#8211; allowing them to reclaim a certain amount of the transaction. For example, Crypto.com offers the Crypto.com VISA card &#8211; which offers up to 5% cashback when buying cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Some offers include a 10% rebate on Expedia or Airbnb bookings and a 100% rebate on your basic subscription plan for Netflix. Importantly, Crypto.com offers a maximum of 1 reimbursement per merchant per month. </p>
<p>Crypto.com offers different card types, each requiring a different amount of minimum investment staked in CRO &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. For example, the Ruby Steel Cashback card requires a minimum of $400 staked in CRO. </p>
<h3><strong>12. Get Free Bitcoin with Crypto Faucets</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto faucets are online websites or apps where you can stand a chance to win free cryptocurrency rewards by carrying out specific tasks or competing in various games. One of the top crypto faucets is FreeBitcoin &#8211; a platform which offers free Bitcoin (BTC) rewards to players. </p>
<p>The FreeBitcoin website claims to offer up to $200 worth of free BTC per hour by competing in games. The site allows players to compete in the HI-LO game, which leverages math and cryptography to offer players a fair chance to win rewards. The platform states that players can wager on the HI-LO dice game, with the top 10 ranked performers standing an opportunity to earn up to 1 Bitcoin every month. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/224787/freebitcoin-crypto-faucet.jpg" alt="Free Bitcoin games" /></figure>
<p>Players can also enter into golden ticket draws after wagering BTC on the HI-LO game to stand a chance to win a free Lamborghini. FreeBitcoin also hosts a referral programme &#8211; where you can refer an individual and earn 50% of their rewards won on the site. With FreeBitcoin, players can also earn interest on crypto such as Bitcoin. Deposit Bitcoin in your FreeBitco.in wallets to earn up to 4.08% annual interest. </p>
<p>Hosting weekly free lotteries, FreeBitcoin states to have over 50 million registered users on its platform. </p>
<h3><strong>13. Earn tokens with Crypto Mining</strong></h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies can be created using either the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">Proof-of-Stake</a> (PoS) or the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. The PoS consensus involves staking cryptos to validate new blocks, with the potential to earn cryptos as a reward. </p>
<p>However, the PoW consensus involves mining cryptocurrency to earn new tokens as a reward. For miners to generate new tokens, they must deploy machines and use large amounts of computational power to solve complex mathematical problems. For example, Bitcoin miners work to solve a mathematical problem &#8211; simultaneously validating new blocks on the blockchain in return for BTC rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/224788/crypto-mining.jpg" alt="Bitcoin mining" /></figure>
<p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-work-coins.htm"><u>best proof of work</u></a> cryptos, Bitcoin provides an estimated 6.25 tokens as rewards for successfully validating a new block. With a maximum supply of 21 million tokens, around 19.17 million tokens are circulating right now. After every 210,000 blocks, the rewards are halved to ensure the demand outweighs the supply. </p>
<p>It is estimated that all the 21 million BTC tokens will be mined and be in circulation by 2140. Unlike staking cryptocurrencies, crypto mining requires large amounts of hardware devices and computational power. As of July 2022, it is estimated that the average cost of mining 1 Bitcoin is $13,000. </p>
<h3><strong>14. Learn and Earn Crypto </strong></h3>
<p>Learn and earn cryptocurrency programs promote crypto education by leveraging cryptocurrency rewards for cryptocurrency investors. By accessing educational material from various sites, users can earn free cryptocurrencies and simultaneously increase their knowledge of digital assets. </p>
<p>For example, Coinbase is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges integrating crypto learn and earn. With ‘Coinbase Earn’, investors can take part in various online quizzes and free courses to earn cryptocurrency rewards. On Coinbase, rewards can be earned in over 20 tokens, depending on the courses you complete. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89608/224789/coinbase-earn.jpg" alt="Learn crypto rewards" /></figure>
<p>Binance is another top cryptocurrency exchange that offers learn and earn crypto rewards. The platform offers ‘Binance Academy’ &#8211; an online educational platform that provides reward certificates and free cryptos. The Binance reward certification requires investors to buy additional digital assets to redeem their rewards. Therefore this method incentivizes new investors &amp; beginners to learn more about this asset class while giving them a chance to earn rewards. </p>
<p>Some beginner traders are also interested in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-auto-trading-platforms.htm">best crypto auto trading platforms</a> that offer convenient features and tools to help make the entire investment process a more hands-off experience.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>This guide has provided some of the best methods to generate free cryptocurrency rewards in 2023. One of the best cryptos right now is Bitcoin ETF Token. $BTCETF can be staked to earn APYs up to 500%. This deflationary cryptocurrency will also decrease 25% of its token supply in the long-term. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino">TG.Casino</a> is a fully licensed Telegram casino. This <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrency</a> will be at the center of the ecosystem and will be used to take part in casino games, earn rewards, and get huge staking returns. </p>
<p>A 100% safe platform to use, the TG Casino has been licensed and audited. This is also one of the first casinos to be solely accessible via Telegram. Since more than 700 million people use Telegram, the casino is looking to attract a new demographic of users. Furthermore, no KYC (Know Your Customer) documents must be filled out before joining the casino. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125382/331130/tg-casino-img.jpg" alt="TG Casino crypto project" /></figure>

<p>The TG Casino offers a matched deposit bonus of 200% on your first deposit, up to 10 ETH.</p>

By combining the seamless integration of Telegram with the transparency and use cases of blockchain technology, TG Casino aims to be one of the top platforms in the coming years. </p>
<p>Since the $TGC token plays a vital role in casino games, the cryptocurrency may gain value as the popularity of this casino increases. The sections below discuss some of the main reasons to hold this cryptocurrency. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Staking Rewards &amp; Buyback Mechanism </strong></h3>
<p>One of the main advantages of holding $TGC is the high staking APYs (Annual Percentage Yield) the token offers. Token holders can purchase the cryptocurrency through the ongoing presale and directly stake $TGC on the staking contracts. </p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">best staking coins</a> in 2023, $TGC, can be staked to earn a live APY of 200%. While the presale has just started a day ago, more than 1 million tokens have already been staked on the staking contract. The staking returns will also depend on the amount you have staked. The more one stakes on the ecosystem, the higher they can potentially earn. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136068" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803823-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-11-00-04-am.png" alt="TG.Casino staking" width="900" height="189" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803823-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-11-00-04-am.png 1190w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803823-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-11-00-04-am-300x63.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803823-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-11-00-04-am-1024x215.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1700803823-screen-shot-2023-11-24-at-11-00-04-am-768x161.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>While $TGC has a modest maximum supply of 100 million tokens, the supply will reduce over time. According to the <a href="https://tg-casino.gitbook.io/tg.casino-whitepaper/">TG.Casino whitepaper</a>, a portion of the profits generated from the casino will be used to buy back tokens from a decentralized exchange (DEX). </p>
<p>40% of the tokens bought back will be burnt on the ecosystem. The remaining tokens will be distributed as rewards through a staking pool. This initiative helps limit price volatility, which is a common occurrence for new tokens. Moreover, distributing token rewards can help build a loyal and thriving community.

<h2><strong>How Does the Bitcoin Profit Platform Work? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Bitcoin Profit trading platform claims to support the buying and selling of new cryptocurrencies for users. Once an account is created, users must make a minimum deposit of $250. </p>
<p>Afterwards, they can supposedly trade multiple tokens such as BTC, BCH, ETH, and more. According to the Bitcoin Profit website, the trading platform is integrated with MetaTrader 4, the popular web-based platform. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/102227/252196/immediate-edge-cryptos.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Profit crypto investment offering" /></figure>
<p>MetaTrader 4 is a third-party device that lets users access multiple technical indicators and tools. Bitcoin Profit also claims to offer a tailor-made web mobile experience. Thus, any iOS or Android device can be used to access Bitcoin Profit. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin Profit does not provide additional information about how the platform operates. All interested readers should research this platform on their own and be aware of the risks involved when trading cryptocurrencies. </p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Profit Key Features &amp; Tools</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>After analyzing some of the claims made by Bitcoin Profit, here are some features of this trading platform: </p>
<h3><strong>Multi-Asset Cryptocurrency Trading</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin Profit supposedly supports multi-asset cryptocurrency trading through its platform. After a user creates an account and makes a minimum deposit, they can trade some of the top-ranked digital assets. </p>
<p>According to the Bitcoin Profit website, one can invest in Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Cardano, XRP, and many more digital assets. Due to a lack of transparency, we could not verify this claim without actually making a minimum deposit and testing the trading platform. </p>
<h3><strong>Demo Trading Account </strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin Profit also claims to offer a demo account to all platform users. A demo trading platform lets one trade with virtual funds. Users can access all the platform trading tools and features and make trading decisions without risking any of their funds. </p>
<p>This way, a member can analyze the potential success of a particular trading strategy. Since demo accounts mirror live market conditions, it is a great way to familiarize yourself with the platform. We cannot confirm whether Bitcoin Profit actually offers the demo account due to the limited information available on this platform. </p>

<h2><strong>Is Bitcoin Profit a Scam? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin Profit claims to offer a cryptocurrency trading platform that is accessible after creating a new account and making a minimum deposit. The platform also states that it supports trading top assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. </p>
<p>However, the lack of information on the platform makes it difficult to verify any of the claims. While Bitcoin Profit also states it offers customer service, there is a lack of user testimonials available on Trustpilot or other similar platforms. </p>
<p>After researching other Bitcoin Profit review pages, we find out that this feeling is mutual. Not much is known about Bitcoin Profit’s founders and development team, which is why one may prefer to conduct extensive research before using this trading platform. </p>

<h2><strong>Who Created Bitcoin Profit? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<p>The anonymity of the platform founders and development team makes it hard to verify much of Bitcoin Profit’s claims. Readers should analyze this trading platform and be aware of the risks involved before making an investment decision. </p>

The BitSoft360 website states that investors can buy and sell multiple digital assets, including large-cap cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p><p>Since BTC and ETH are 66% and 67% below their all-time highs, new investors may see this as an opportunity to enter the digital assets space.

On BitSoft360, one can instantly create a new account by filling in the details on the registration page. The platform states that users need to first make a minimum deposit of $250 to begin trading, similar to other popular crypto robot tools we&#8217;ve reviewed on this site such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/biticodes-review.htm">BitiCodes</a>.</p><p>However, the online website provides no extra information on how BitSoft360 works.

The MT4 platform allows users to trade forex, cryptocurrencies and many more assets by accessing real-time price data, technical indicators, and other trading tools.&nbsp;</p><p>BitSoft360 also claims to support Web Trader, another web-based platform that lets investors open and close trades without downloading any additional software.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the website, Bitsoft 360 uses its algorithm to detect market movement and automatically enters trades at the best available price, then closes the trade at an optimal profit level.</p><p>The software and algorithm also uses copy trading and stop losses to ensure users don&#8217;t lose large sums during their trading &#8211; however, as with all trading robots, users should ensure to carefully monitor the performance.</p><h3>Which Devices Use Bitsoft360?</h3><p>Bitsoft 360 is available on all devices that have a web browser and working internet connection.&nbsp;</p><p>That includes Android and iOS devices such as smartphones, desktop PCs, laptops and tablets.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there is no dedicated mobile app for Bitsoft360.</p><h3>Which Brokers and Exchanges has Bitsoft360 Partnered With?</h3><p>We were unable to review exactly which brokers are used as they differ for each user based on location.</p><h3>Can I use Bitsoft360 in this Country?</h3><p>Bitsoft360 is available in many nations around the world, although the USA is a notable exception as CFD trading is not allowed. However, there are reports that the platform can be accessed with a VPN in certain nations.</p><p>Bitsoft 360 is available in the UK, Australia, Canada, many other major European nations and across African and Asia.</p><h3>How Much Profit Can I Make with Bitsoft360?</h3><p>Bitsoft 360 has a claimed win rate of 90%, although we have been unable to verify those claims over a long period.</p><p>Bit Capex Pro 360 users should continually monitor the performance of the trading robot should they sign up, as trading is inherently risky and losing some trades is an inevitable feature.</p><p>Beginners should only invest what they can afford to lose and be aware that many countries tax trading profits.</p><p>Successful traders also develop their own strategies and analytical insights rather than solely relying on trading robots.</p><h2>BitSoft360 Key Features</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Our BitSoft360 review will now discuss some of the platform features. These features have been analyzed after studying the claims made by the BitSoft 360 platform.&nbsp;</p><h3>Supports Multiple Digital Assets&nbsp;</h3><p>BitSoft360 claims to offer a trading platform that lets users buy and sell cryptocurrency assets. Once the account has been created, members must make a deposit before accessing the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterwards, BitSoft 360 states that investors can begin trading multiple tokens, including BTC, ETH, ADA, BCH, XRP, and many more.&nbsp;</p><h3>Offers a Demo Account</h3><p>The BitSoft360 trading platform also claims to provide a demo trading account that all members can use. A demo account allows users to trade assets using virtual funds. A demo trading account typically mirrors the live market conditions of the standard account.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that one can access all the trading tools of the standard platform to test out future strategies. The demo account is one way traders can analyze the potential of a particular trading platform without losing any funds.

The platform states that centralized banks and financial institutions have caused several issues in the last few decades.</p><p>In 2008, when the housing market collapse took place, it was the centralized institutions and government that were at fault. Around 15 years later, people still face the same issues with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/25/governments-advised-to-cut-public-spending-or-raise-taxes-to-curb-inflation">rising taxes, an increase in inflation</a>, and multi-billion dollar companies leaking our private information.</p><p>Anarchy is leveraging blockchain technology to build a community that can be truly decentralized. By holding $ANA, an ERC-20 token, users will be able to make rewards and be a part of taking the platform forward through the Anarchy DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323006/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323006/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_426.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323006/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_341.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323006/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_284.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323006/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_142.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img"></figure><p>The Anarchy movement aims to stand for free speech, privacy rights and empower individuals in the ecosystem. By entering the $ANA presale, users can benefit from one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm"><u>best penny tokens</u></a> in 2023.</p><p>As seen since the start of 2023, meme tokens have been among the best investments to make. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-pepecoin-trader-turned-dollar263-into-millions">Tokens such as Pepe ($PEPE) and Milady ($LADYS) have generated a return of more than 1,000%</a> in only a few weeks. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, Anarchy&rsquo;s $ANA token will look to become the next <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm"><u>best meme coin</u></a> in the future.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/anarchy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Anarchy</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Anarchy: Key Components</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In the sections below, we will look at some of the key components of the Anarchy platform.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>$ANA Token&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>One of the main features of this cryptocurrency platform is the native token, $ANA. This is an ERC-20 token, which has been built on the Ethereum blockchain. In total, $ANA has a maximum supply of 69.42 billion tokens.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323008/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323008/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_438.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323008/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_350.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323008/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_292.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323008/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_146.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img"></figure><p>80% of the token supply has been allocated for the ongoing presale, while the remaining 20% will be used for exchange listings. In the future, 0.5% of the token supply will be burnt on the ecosystem. Through $ANA, Anarchy community members can monetize their time spent on this platform.</p><h3><strong>Anarchy DAO&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Holders of the $ANA token get access to Anarchy&rsquo;s decentralized autonomous organization. A governance token, $ANA, can be held to make decisions on the ecosystem. Every month, the community DAO will vote on deciding how to spend funds on the ecosystem.</p><p>The funds will be received on the DAO through a tax implemented on the ecosystem. Whenever traders decide to buy or sell $ANA, a 4.5% tax will be levied and sent to the DAO.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323007/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323007/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_364.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323007/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_291.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323007/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_243.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323007/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_121.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img"></figure><p>Through the DAO, community members can also vote for DAO ambassadors, who will be responsible for handling the treasury.&nbsp; Anarchy will use Gnosis Safe to secure the treasury by using multi-signature solutions.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Anarchy Community&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Anarchy plans to expand to help grow the community in the long term. Since the community is of vital importance to maintain the DAO and promote the $ANA token, Anarchy has already started promoting itself on social media platforms.</p><p>Through the <a href="https://twitter.com/anarchycoineth">Anarchy Twitter</a> account, the platform aims to communicate about presale developments, new announcements, and milestones to the general public. Interested readers can also join the <a href="https://t.me/anarchyarmy"><u>Anarchy Telegram channel</u></a> to stay updated with all new project developments and announcements.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Is ANA Token a Worthwhile Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Before investing in this new token presale, let&rsquo;s analyze whether $ANA is a good investment in the first place.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Available to Buy at the Lowest Levels&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>At the time of writing, $ANA is priced at only $0.00024 per token. The token is available to buy during the second presale round. A cryptocurrency presale is a great way for investors to purchase a limited number of tokens before a potential explosion in the price.&nbsp;</p><p>While meme coins can be volatile investments, many offer more than 10x or even 100x returns. While there is no guarantee that $ANA will offer such returns, the meme coins space has recently been among the best-performing crypto niches.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm"><u>top cryptos to watch</u></a>, the price of $ANA can increase after the exchange listing takes place. This will help increase the trading volume and help push the price upwards. Therefore, long-term investors may choose to diversify their portfolios by acquiring this cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Presale Giveaways&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>To promote the ongoing presale, Anarchy is running a huge giveaway. The giveaway will award 4 lucky winners with 1 ETH ($1,842). Users must purchase $ANA through the ongoing presale round to join the giveaway.</p><p>Users must also follow Anarchy on its social media pages. On a <a href="https://twitter.com/anarchycoineth/status/1669618721046888448">post made by the platform&rsquo;s Twitter page</a>, Anarchy states that users can participate in the giveaway by retweeting the tweet, liking the post, and following the Twitter page. Finally, tag two more friends to stand a chance to win the 1 ETH prize.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What makes Anarchy Unique?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Anarchy aims to be a part of the meme revolution that has been experienced in the crypto markets for the past few years. However, the platform stands out from some of the other existing projects.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, while meme coins such as Shiba Inu have a growing token supply of 586 trillion and counting, $ANA has a limited supply. A lower supply can help increase the price when there is a jump in demand. Furthermore, the 0.5% tax implementation will help decrease the total supply of $ANA in the long term.</p><p>Moreover, Anarchy&rsquo;s DAO aims to offer true decentralization to community members. People can decide on the platform&rsquo;s future outlook by selecting new leaders and voting on decisions. This shows that Anarchy is one of the few platforms that is actually listening and involving the public to help grow the platform.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Who is behind Anarchy?&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Anarchy is a 100% community token, which aims to be run by the people who hold the $ANA token. While there is no information available on the platform&#8217;s founders, we know that the community will play an integral part in moving this platform forward.</p><h2><strong>Anarchy Presale&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The Anarchy presale is the first time $ANA tokens are offered to the public. The token presale began in June 2023. Currently, the token is priced at only $0.00024 during the second round.</p><p>From a total supply of 69.420 billion tokens, 80% has been allocated for the ongoing presale. One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>best crypto presales</u></a>, Anarchy, has already raised more than $200K. Therefore, interested readers can buy $ANA at the earliest presale stage before the price increases.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no minimum amount to get started with the presale. Investors can connect a crypto wallet to connect with the presale or purchase $ETH with a card on the platform itself. After the presale ends, Anarchy will look to conduct its initial exchange offering.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Buy ANA Tokens</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Interested in being a part of the Anarchy token presale? The sections below will show readers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/anarchy/en">how to start investing in $ANA</a> in just a few simple steps.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Before purchasing presale tokens, investors are required to set up a cryptocurrency wallet. Luckily, Anarchy is compatible with a wide range of cryptocurrency wallets. MetaMask and Wallet Connect are some of the best available wallets to use.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, the presale can also be accessed with the Coinbase wallet, Trust, BitKeep, and SafePal. Choose the wallet of your choice, and download it as an extension if you are using a browser. When using wallets such as MetaMask on mobile, simply get the mobile app and set it up.</p><h3><strong>Step 2: Buy ETH/BNB or USDT Tokens&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>$ANA tokens can be swapped with some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm"><u>best altcoins</u></a>, including Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB). If you do not hold any of these tokens in your wallet, purchase them from a crypto exchange of your choice.&nbsp;</p><p>After buying the coins, send them to your cryptocurrency wallet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Connect the Wallet to the Presale Website&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Once the tokens are in your crypto wallet, visit the Anarchy presale website. On the homepage, you will be able to see the presale price and a &lsquo;Connect Wallet&rsquo; option right below. Click on this option, choose your own cryptocurrency wallet, and follow the instructions to connect the wallet with the presale.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323009/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122049/323009/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_452.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323009/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_362.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323009/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_301.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122049/323009/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_151.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="900" class="content-img"></figure><h3><strong>Step 4: Purchase $ANA Tokens&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>After the wallet is connected, enter the number of tokens you wish to purchase. You can choose to swap with either ETH/USDT or BNB. For instance, when you wish to swap 0.002 ETH, you will receive 17,475 ANA tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>After entering the swapping amount, click on &lsquo;Buy $ANA.&rsquo; Alternatively, investors can purchase ETH with a card directly on the presale website and then make the swap.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 5: Claim the Tokens</strong></h3><p>While you would have confirmed your purchase during the ongoing presale, you can only access the tokens after the presale ends.
