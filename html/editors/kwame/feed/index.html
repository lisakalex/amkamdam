<h2><b>MyStake Bonuses &amp; Promos</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bonuses and promotions are key areas in which this casino shines. Their reward scheme will entice both newcomers and regulars.</p>
<h3><b>MyStake Welcome Bonus Offers</b></h3>
<p>You can go down two avenues when you deposit &#8211; fiat or crypto.</p>
<p>MyStake’s crypto welcome bonus is <b>170% up to $1000. </b>Deposit no less than $20, then manually activate your bonus &#8211; that’s essential. Get it done before you start to play, or you’ll cancel out your eligibility for the bonus.</p>
<p>This particular offer comes with MyStake’s standard 30x wagering requirement. That means the total sum of the combined amount of your initial deposit plus the bonus received must be wagered 30x before receiving your winnings.</p>
<p>MyStake’s fiat welcome bonus is a slightly less rewarding <b>100% up to $1000</b>, but those looking to deposit less than<b> $200 will be matched 150%.</b> Once again, it comes with a 30x wagering requirement.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more&#8230;</p>
<p>MyStake’s <b>eSports Welcome Bonus</b> offers <b>100% up to $500.</b> The same rules apply &#8211; deposit a minimum of $20, activate the bonus and spend the next 30 days scrambling to meet the 30x wagering requirement &#8211; except this specific bonus is only available for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-esports-betting-sites.htm">eSports</a> betting.</p>
<p>About the wagering requirements &#8211; if you don’t make it, don’t worry; you’re not the first. Though you will lose both the bonus money and subsequent winnings if you don’t meet their wagering requirements, it’s worth noting that a 30-day grace period is almost 100% more than most other casinos offer.</p>
<h3><b>Existing Customer Promos</b></h3>
<p>Those looking beyond a generous MyStake Welcome Offer have much to look forward to.</p>
<h4><b>Sports Promos</b></h4>
<p><b>New Season &#8211; 30% Cashback: </b>Bet on the top soccer leagues and get 30% CashBack on Sports, Slots and Mini Games. ​​You’ll receive 10% in free spins on Lazy Sheriff, 10% as a sports-free bet and 10% as a Mini Games Free Bet. The bonus is awarded based on every ten units of your bet &#8211; meaning a $30 bet will earn you a $3 bonus (or equivalent).</p>
<p><b>10% Cashback: </b>Bet on the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023, US Open 2023, or Rugby World Cup 2023 and receive a 10% weekly Freebet in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-nfl-betting-sites.htm">Sportsbook</a>. The Freebet is calculated every week and credited to your account on Mondays. For instance, a Net Weekly Loss of $100 will result in a 10% calculation, equalling $10 Freebet. The Freebet amount is determined by the total of all your tickets placed on these events throughout the week.</p>
<p><b>35% Reload Bonus: </b>Deposits between $20 and $350 can earn you a 35% bonus, to which you’re entitled on ALL your deposits. The maximum reward is $125 per deposit, but you can expect to see it reflected in your balance immediately. This Sports Bonus comes with just a 7x wagering requirement, and you still get 30 days to meet it.</p>
<p><b>3 + 1 Freebet: </b>Place 3 bets, and get a 4th for free. The value of the 4th is calculated to be the mean of your initial 3 bets. Say your bets are $25, $50, and $75, and your free bet will be 25+50+75 divided by 3, which is $50. The maximum free bet award is $100.</p>
<h4><b>Casino Promos</b></h4>

<p><b>10% Crypto Cashback: </b>They’ll add up your monthly crypto deposits and give you 10% cashback on your losses. Say you deposit $500 in BTC. If you lose it, you&#8217;ll still get $50 back.</p>
<p><b>100% up to $500 &#8211; 2nd Deposit Bonus: </b>Your 2nd deposit, between $20 to $500, is matched 100% with a reload bonus. You get it immediately after you claim it, but it&#8217;s valid only once. Nevertheless, ALL MyStake players claiming their 1st deposit bonus are eligible.</p>
<h3><b>MyStake Loyalty Program</b></h3>
<p>Their loyalty program offers several benefits. One key feature is a 10% cashback bonus on losses. But that’s not all &#8211; regular players are often rewarded based on their gameplay and activities.</p>

<h2><b>MyStake Sports Betting</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135141" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700657472-mystake-sportsbook-300x128.jpg" alt="MyStake sports betting options" width="1000" height="428" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700657472-mystake-sportsbook-300x128.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700657472-mystake-sportsbook-1024x438.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700657472-mystake-sportsbook-768x329.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700657472-mystake-sportsbook-1536x657.jpg 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700657472-mystake-sportsbook-2048x876.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If there’s one thing to be said about MyStake’s sportsbook, it’s BIG. With their lobby almost functioning as its own site, you’ll find numerous promotions supporting your fun with basketball, football, tennis, ice hockey and eSports games to bet on.</p>
<h3><b>Available Sports &amp; Markets</b></h3>
<p>Bettors have a wide variety of betting opportunities across over 30 different sports, including popular ones like football, basketball, tennis, and American football, with numerous betting markets and options like match bets, handicaps, and totals.</p>
<p>Virtual sports at MyStake feature artificial leagues across various sports, offering continuous virtual games with live broadcasts, albeit with slightly less extensive betting markets. Horse and greyhound racing are given special emphasis, with bets available from races worldwide, accompanied by detailed information on each contestant.</p>
<p>Esports betting is another strong area, with a dedicated lobby for major games like Counter-Strike, League of Legends, Dota 2, and Valorant. The esports coverage includes a variety of bet types, extending beyond match winners to more specific game events. Additionally, MyStake caters to niche sports and even offers betting on non-sporting events like politics and entertainment awards.</p>
<h3><b>MyStake Odds </b></h3>
<p>MyStake Sportsbook offers decent odds across various sports, with live betting odds updated in real-time to assist in making informed decisions during live events. While its odds may not always match the very best betting sites, they are considered fair and competitive.</p>
<p>The platform is particularly noteworthy for its competitive odds in football and baseball. It&#8217;s important to note that the more significant the sporting league, the more competitive the odds tend to be at MyStake.</p>
<p>For instance, Major League Baseball (MLB) and major European football leagues typically offer better odds. However, tennis enthusiasts might find the betting margins at MyStake slightly higher than the market average​​.</p>
<p>Regarding specific betting margins, MyStake&#8217;s odds are broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseball: 4.09%</li>
<li>Basketball: 5.89%</li>
<li>eSports: 6.7%</li>
<li>Football: 4.95%</li>
<li>Tennis: 7.87%</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall betting margin averages out to 5.9%. This breakdown indicates that MyStake offers relatively competitive odds, especially in sports like baseball and football, while the margins for tennis are somewhat higher than average.</p>

<p>MyStake’s modern interface competes with the best crypto casinos in the industry. They’ve made it easy to switch between their sportsbook and casino and made sure browsing their games library is just as simple. Let’s say you’re looking exclusively for Megaways titles &#8211; after selecting the subgenre, any term you type in the search bar will only bring up titles within the genre. If you leave the term in the search bar and move to another subgenre, the results will change accordingly.</p>
<p>What also stands out is MyStake&#8217;s responsiveness across different devices. Desktop, tablet or mobile device, you’ll see everything you need to see, and it will all run smoothly. No matter where you go, no matter what you’re using, you can be sure to have a polished experience on the site.</p>
<h2><b>Does MyStake Have a Mobile App?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Many MyStake reviews wax lyrical about the casino&#8217;s smooth, cross-platform UI/UX design. This comes down to HTML5, practically guaranteeing users a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. There is also a mobile app available at the Apple and Google Play Store, and it is tailor-made for that extra bit of seamlessness if you are looking for more.</p>
<p>With the web app, you needn’t worry about updates, storage space or using too much data. There is no need to download APK files from dodgy sources either, and you can be sure to rely on MyStake’s SSL128 encryption to safeguard your data. Their web app adapts to any device, but the mobile app gives you a more bespoke experience. We advise downloading the web app for your tablet, laptop or desktop and the mobile app for your phone.</p>
<h2><b>MyStake Security</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With MyStake Casino implementing various security measures, it’s important to note their commitment to your safety.</p>
<p><b>Data Encryption and Security Protocols: </b>As stated earlier, SSL128 encryption guards all information passing between your browser and their server. Your personal and financial details are seen only by the relevant parties &#8211; only authorized personnel at MyStake can store and manage your data securely. And, for an added layer of security, you can set up 2FA (two-factor authentication).</p>
<p><b>Licensing and Regulation:</b> MyStake Casino is owned and operated by Curaco-based Santeda International B.V. (registration number: 151296) which, in turn, operates through Cyprus-based Payment Agent SANTEDA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED (registration number: HE406761; registered in Cyprus with actual address: Patrikiou Loumoumpa, 7, Block A, Flat A13, 7560 Pervolia, Larnaca, Cyprus).</p>
<p>Though a <a href="https://crustlab.com/blog/curacao-gaming-license-casino-regulations/">Curacao gaming license</a> is the best a crypto casino can acquire, the regulatory body is not as respected as a UKGC or MGA license. The latter-mentioned bodies have rules that essentially, bar the use of cryptocurrencies to remain on top of money laundering. Still, you’re in good hands with any licensed casino and are much better off than you would be playing at an unlicensed casino.</p>
<p><b>RNG (Random Number Generators):</b> MyStake only partnered with providers who’ve been independently tested to ensure RNGs are running their games. Random Number Generators are fairly common. If you’re unfamiliar with them, you can find one online and experiment to get a feel for how fixed in fairness any game using them will be.</p>
<p><b>Responsible Gaming:</b> MyStake holds a dedicated page on Responsible Gaming, featuring crucial information for all who may be worried about developing a gambling addiction. There, you’ll find tools and other websites dedicated to helping players overcome or avoid addiction.</p>
