<p>Lucky Block&#8217;s successful presale was followed by an even more explosive initial coin offering (ICO). The demand for the Lucky Block (LBLOCK) token was overwhelming and showed in its over 50x price rally to approximately one cent. </p>
<p>LBLOCK has provided early investors huge returns, and market participants are predicting both coins&#8217; future trajectory &#8211; there is now a V1 and V2 token. We reviewed the project&#8217;s fundamentals and provided a potential Lucky Block price prediction for 2023 to 2025.</p>
<p>Our guide deep dives into Lucky Block&#8217;s roadmap and analyzes the factors that could provide investors with even more returns. To make investing in Lucky Block simpler, we also cover a step-by-step guide on how to buy LBLOCK V2.</p>
<h2><strong>Price Prediction of Lucky Block 2023 &#8211; 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before providing a detailed outlook of each year, we provided a price prediction and a brief summary.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023: </strong>An altcoin season in 2023 in the run up to the 2024 Bitcoin halving could drive Lucky Block&#8217;s price to its next key resistance, which is at $0.005.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2025: </strong>Another crypto bear market could ensue in 2025 but not before Lucky Block potentially sets a new all-time high. After that rally, the coin should find strong support at $0.003.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The History of Lucky Block&#8217;s Price</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Lucky Block proved it would be a successful project from the beginning. Before its exchange listing, Lucky Block had an extremely successful <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a>. Early-rounding funding gave investors an opportunity to get an edge over the rest of the market.</p>
<p>High demand for Lucky Block&#8217;s token, LBLOCK, resulted in the presale selling out ahead of time. Launched in Q4 2021, Lucky Block&#8217;s presale was scheduled to last 90 days. Just over 32 billion tokens were available for early investors. The overwhelming demand for the LBLOCK token sold out the presale within 49 days.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221650/lucky-block-wallet.jpg" alt="NFT wallet stylized" /></figure>
<p>What made Lucky Block&#8217;s sold-out presale even more impressive is that it happened during the ongoing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-opinions-should-people-follow-during-bear-market.htm">crypto bear market</a>.</p>
<p>Another key reason investors see huge potential in Lucky Block is that the platform has now transformed itself from just a jackpot prize-draw project to also being a robust NFT competitions platform. Lucky Block&#8217;s decentralized prize draws still run, with better transparency and security than traditional platforms, and are now supplemented by NFT giveaways. </p>
<p>The arduous and inefficient process of claiming prizes from conventional draws has made participants apprehensive about entering them. Lucky Block simplified the process by using blockchain, thereby enabling instant payouts and hosting of daily draws. </p>
<p>Entering Lucky Block draws involves participants in good causes as 10% of the total funds collected are distributed to charities, and 70% are dedicated to winners. The remaining 20% is divided between marketing, the token holders and the NFT pool.</p>
<p>After the presale, Lucky Block V1 was listed on the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap on 26 January 2022. High demand from the presale had spilled over to the ICO and resulted in the first Lucky Block bull cycle.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221639/lblock-2.jpg" alt="LBLOCK price chart" /></figure>
<p>The LBLOCK price pumped more than 1,000% in the month since it started trading. More exchange listings followed, resulting in a further spike after the LBank listing on 11 February last year.  </p>
<p>The entire bull run had provided investors with more than 1,100% returns within the first few weeks after the Lucky Block ICO. Investors who bought the coin during the earliest stage of the presale had profited by an even higher margin &#8211; a private sale took place during which the LBLOCK price was $0.00015.</p>
<p>LBLOCK reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.0095 on 17 February 2022, then proceeded to correct. The Lucky Block V1 price today (at the time of writing) is near $0.000234.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick recap of LBLOCK&#8217;s price history:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lucky Block&#8217;s presale launched in Q4 2021 and sold out early — within 49 days of the planned 90 days.</li>
<li>PancakeSwap listed LBLOCK V1 on 26 January 2022, and a bull run followed.</li>
<li>Investors who bought Lucky Block at ICO profited more than 1,100% by mid-February last year.</li>
<li>Lucky Block reached an ATH of $0.0095 on 17 February last year, providing presale investors with more than 3,000% returns.</li>
<li>The LBLOCK V2 price is currently $0.00052 and it is listed on LBank, MEXC, Uniswap and Gate.io</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>LBLOCK Price Prediction 2023</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We foresee several factors for a further LBLOCK price pump in 2023. One of them is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-tweets-with-crypto-prices-crashing-fomc-day.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> action. The altcoin market has proven that it follows Bitcoin. Many investors believe that Bitcoin is in a bear market short term, but in the long term will set a new ATH.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221660/bitcoin-price-chart.jpg" alt="LBLOCK price chart" /></figure>
<p><i>                                                  Bitcoin Price History &#8211; Previous Bear Market</i></p>
<p>Either way, Bitcoin is poised for more upward movement in the long run. Even if Bitcoin is in a bear market, it hasn&#8217;t had a significant short-term rally since crashing from its ATH, which was similar price action during the 2018 bear market (shown above).</p>
<p>After reaching its ATH in 2018, Bitcoin crashed but then bounced to Fibonacci retracement level 0.702. Then, it resumed its bear market. Now that Bitcoin crashed from its ATH of $69,000, it hasn&#8217;t has a short-term rally to the 0.702 Fib, which is expected.</p>
<p>If it were to hit that price target, Bitcoin would rally to $53,000 and take the altcoin market with it. That means LBLOCK is likely to test its next resistance, at $0.005 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Another key development that will make Lucky Block more attractive to investors and possibly result in higher demand is the LBLOCK token burn.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221691/lucky-block-token-burn.jpg" alt="Lucky Block token burn" /></p>
<p>Lucky Block CEO Scott Ryder announced a monthly token burn in September last year. The intent is to make the coin more valuable. Many cryptos have experienced a drastic rise in value after announcing token burns because investors value scarce assets (most recently Terra LUNA and LUNC).</p>
<p>After the token burn announcement, Lucky Block&#8217;s price spiked by 60% within 3 days.</p>
<p>In 2023, Lucky Block&#8217;s circulating supply will therefore diminish drastically, making it more challenging for investors to buy LBLOCK and causing the LBLOCK token price to rise.</p>
<h2><strong>LBLOCK Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Lucky Block is potentially one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos to buy</a> right now before it goes on another bull run, due to its low price point making it undervalued. If LBLOCK reaches resistance at $0.005 in 2023 and breaks through it, its next target will be the ATH at $0.0095.</p>
<p>The crypto community has witnessed a Bitcoin bull run in 2021, but it hasn&#8217;t yet seen a significant altcoin bull run. An alt season usually follows Bitcoin&#8217;s bull run, and if that were to happen, we could see Lucky Block become the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/next-cryptocurrency-to-explode.htm">next cryptocurrency to explode</a> and set a new high.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221707/lucky-block-moonsshot.jpg" alt="Lucky Block rocket" /></figure>
<p>An altcoin bull run could possibly pump Lucky Block&#8217;s price to $0.015, an increase of 57% from its current ATH. That could happen before 2025, as a brutal crypto winter market is expected to be in full force during 2025.</p>
<p>After a bull run, a crypto market crash or correction has to follow. Since many investors believe that crypto&#8217;s bear market will be harsh, it&#8217;s possible that Lucky Block breaks through some of its key supports as it pulls back.</p>
<p>Our LBLOCK price prediction for 2025 is that the coin will retest $0.003 &#8211; $0.004 and find strong support at around that level. </p>

<h2><strong>Lucky Block&#8217;s Potential Highs and Lows</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Even the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> are volatile and can consolidate in a specific range for prolonged periods. We prepared the potential highs and lows Lucky Block&#8217;s price could reach.</p>

<h2><strong>How Do Investors Benefit from Lucky Block?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Lucky Block isn&#8217;t just another crypto project offering no utility and based off hype. Its price spikes are indicative of investor confidence because it provides several benefits.</p>
<h3><strong>Prizes &amp; Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>Participants can choose the competition they wish to enter. Prizes vary in size from a luxury watch to a home worth $1 million. Draws are hosted daily, and payouts are instantaneous. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221761/step-12.jpg" alt="Platinum Club NFT holder benefits" /></figure>
<p>The main prizes are in the Platinum Roller Club NFT. To enter, participants need to own Lucky Block NFTs. Participants buy the limited 10,000 NFTs via the Launchpad.xyz. Competitions are hosted weekly and Platinum Rollers Club holders are automatically entered.</p>
<p>The added benefit of holding LBLOCK is that participants can earn even if they didn&#8217;t win one of the main prizes. That&#8217;s because Lucky Block provides rewards daily to participants as long as they have their NFTs in their wallets.</p>
<p>The platform provides the most rewards to investors who have the highest number of NFTs for the longest duration. </p>
<h3><strong>Capital Appreciation</strong></h3>
<p>Investors looking for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long term crypto project</a> will find Lucky Block to be an ideal investment. A cryptocurrency can provide longevity only if it solves a real-world problem and provides investors high returns.</p>
<p>Lucky Block has demonstrated both. Investors who bought LBLOCK during its private sale or presale received more than 1,000% returns after the coin&#8217;s major exchange listings. In mid-September last year, LBLOCK V1 spiked around 60% after the announcement of the token burn.</p>
<p>As for utility, Lucky Block has drastically expanded its prize range. But more importantly, it&#8217;s made NFT and crypto giveaways more fair and transparent by hosting them on the blockchain &#8211; in the case of Lucky Block V1 on the Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221797/lucky-blogk-platform.jpg" alt="Lucky Block crypto project" /></figure>
<p>By decentralizing its draws, Lucky Block has made its competition platform more secure. A third party cannot interfere in the draws and sway the results.</p>
<h2><strong>What Influences Lucky Block&#8217;s Price?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>LBLOCK is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">cryptocurrencies with the highest upside</a> because it has several key factors that influence its price favorably.</p>
<h3><strong>Developments </strong></h3>
<p>Lucky Block is constantly evolving to offer investors more returns and provide bigger prizes to competition participants. Its latest development is the 1% token burn. That will take place monthly, which will significantly reduce the coin&#8217;s supply over a prolonged period.</p>
<p>Part of the CEO&#8217;s announcement was Lucky Block partnering with major Web3 projects. Another announcement was more <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-coin-listing.htm">exchange listings</a> for the Lucky Block V2 token.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221792/lucky-block-v2.jpg" alt="LBlock v2 token features" /></figure>
<p>A major development to the Lucky Block network is its ERC-20 token update, known as LBLOCK V2. At launch, Lucky Block had developed a BEP-20 token to enable participants to enter draws and receive payouts instantly. </p>
<p>Although transaction fees for buying tickets with the BEP-20 didn&#8217;t apply, investors incurred a 12% sales tax for trading the coin. Lucky Block wanted to provide a sales tax-free token, so it developed LBLOCK V2.</p>
<p>This ERC-20 token, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">proof of stake crypto</a>, expedited centralized exchange listings. Lucky Block is listed on LBank, MEXC, Uniswap, and Gate.io.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221799/l-bridge.jpg" alt="Lucky Block bridge" /></figure>
<p>Part of the development of LBLOCK V2 is the upcoming Lucky Block Bridge. This Ethereum bridge will enable investors to transfer their assets between protocols from one smart contract chain to release them into another.</p>
<h3><strong>Speculation</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest growing cryptos</a> went on bull runs based purely on speculation. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, where investors thought that altcoins would pump, so they bought, thereby driving the price up.</p>
<p>Lucky Block is another altcoin that has been the subject of speculation. Many investors believed that certain fundamental changes to Lucky Block&#8217;s platform would result in price pumps. To profit from those movements, investors bought Lucky Block and fueled further speculations of price spikes as their purchases increased demand.</p>
<p>The latest speculation among many investors is that altcoins are due for a bull run and LBLOCK is an undervalued crypto asset. The market sentiment on Bitcoin is bearish, but many investors believe that an altcoin bull run should follow any Bitcoin price rally.</p>
<p>Lucky Block has proven that its price can pump massively. And once more members of the crypto community change their sentiment to bullish, an altcoin bull run is likely to follow.</p>
<h3><strong>Effective Marketing Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> had rallies because of endorsements by Elon Musk and other celebrities. Lucky Block has partnered with several celebrities to broaden its exposure.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221808/dillina-white.jpg" alt="Dillian Whyte wearing Lucky Block hat" /></figure>
<p>One of the key partnerships Lucky Block formed was with heavyweight boxing champion Dillian Whyte. The 12-month contract with the heavyweight champion enabled Lucky Block to showcase its brand to millions of viewers.</p>
<p>Whyte wore Lucky Block merchandise to the weigh-in of his prize fight with Tyson Fury. The brand endorsement by Whyte solidified Lucky Block&#8217;s reputation of being a legit crypto project teaming up with the best athletes.</p>
<p>But Whyte wasn&#8217;t the only celebrity to become part of the Lucky Block roster. This NFT competition platform went on to sign another boxing champion, Florian Marku, as well and Savannah Marshall. Another celebrity to team up with Lucky Block was Love Island&#8217;s Jamie Lewitt.</p>
<p>That resulted in the launch of the boxing podcast <i>Fighting on the Inside. </i>The podcast is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LuckyBlockCoin">YouTube</a>, and Whyte and Marku have signed on to appear.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Invest in Lucky Block</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We&#8217;ve written a detailed guide on how to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-lucky-block.htm">buy Lucky Block</a>, but here&#8217;s a quick tutorial to help investors get started &#8211; specifically with buying LBLOCK V2.</p>
<p>It can be time-consuming to invest in LBLOCK V1 via decentralized exchanges. A simpler process is to use the centralized exchange LBank which today supports the V2 token.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Open LBank Account</strong></h3>
<p>Investors should <a href="https://www.lbank.info/invitevip?icode=13FDI&amp;lange=en-US">visit LBank&#8217;s website</a> and open an account by inputting an email address and password.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221822/step-1-lb.jpg" alt="LBank registration page" /></figure>
<p>Verify the account by inputting the code sent to the email used for registration.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Buy USDT</strong></h3>
<p>Investors need to own USDT to exchange for LBLOCK. On the homepage, investors can input the amount of USDT to buy and then click &#8216;Buy now.&#8217;</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221823/step-2lb.jpg" alt="LBank dashboard" /></figure>
<p>The next step is to select the preferred payment method: debit/credit card or peer-to-peer (P2P).</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Search for LBLOCK</strong></h3>
<p>To enter the exchange, investors should click the Trade icon at the top, followed by Spot. Once on the exchange, investors should use the search box on the left and type &#8216;LBLOCK&#8217;.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221826/step-6lb.jpg" alt="LBK to USDT price chart" /></figure>
<p>When the symbol appears, click on it.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Buy LBLOCK</strong></h3>
<p>Investors need to enter the number of LBLOCK to purchase, then click &#8216;Buy LBLOCK&#8217; to confirm the order.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221827/step-7lb.jpg" alt="LBLOCK token on exchange" /></figure>
<h2>Accessing LBLOCK Through Binance</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are some other places to buy LuckyBlock. The coin is not currently available on the Binance exchange, but this is our prime recommendation mainly due to its 0.1% fee, which is much lower than other major exchanges. You can purchase a token such as BNB on Binance and use it to purchase LBLOCK on a decentralized or centralized exchange, as it has the lowest fees for the initial purchase. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to use Binance&#8217;s self-custody wallet to connect with presales, taking the place of other options like MetaMask. However, the Binance self-custody wallet has to be accepted by the official presale page. </p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136799" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1701097557-screen-shot-2023-11-27-at-15-05-09-e1701097576782.png" alt="How To Buy Lucky Block" width="900" height="349" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from this, Binance has a huge range of products and services as the world&#8217;s largest exchange by trade volume. This includes a dedicated NFT marketplace, a stake-to-earn program, loans, futures, a P2P marketplace, educational resources, and more. Binance is also very easy to use and has a swift signup process, along with strong security protocols. </p>
<p>While Lucky Block is not listed on Binance at the present time, that might soon change &#8211; Binance is continually adding new coins to its list. </p>

<h2><strong>Is Lucky Block the Best Crypto to Invest in This Year?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The answer to the question lies in Lucky Block&#8217;s utility. Investors should ask themselves if this platform solves real-world problems. The answer is, yes. Lucky Block has made competition entries and prize payouts decentralized, simpler and safer &#8211; a clear use case.</p>
<p>Its competition platform is safe and transparent as it&#8217;s hosted on the blockchain, which prevents third parties from interfering. Lucky Block offers competition participants huge prizes. </p>
<p>Another bullish catalyst for Lucky Block is the public team&#8217;s constant strive to make its network and token more valuable &#8211; unlike some crypto projects the founding team are not anonymous, they self-doxxed and frequently appear on AMA (ask me anything) events and similar Q&amp;A sessions with LBLOCK holders.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88249/221906/lbank-listing.jpg" alt="LBLOCK listed on LBank" /></figure>
<p>Lucky Block developed a BEP-20 token and later an ERC-20 token (V2 token), the latter of which is ideal for day trading because a sales tax isn&#8217;t applicable. The V2 token has resulted in more CEX listings, providing more exposure and increasing demand. </p>
<p>More exchange listings are in the pipeline and so are monthly 1% token burns. Lucky Block will receive more exposure due to additional listings, but its token burn will decrease supply. Increased demand and decreased supply are the perfect combinations for a scarce asset which is already at a low price point, potentially undervalued with a low market cap (currently $15 million).</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Lucky Block&#8217;s platform has incentivized participants to enter draws by offering major prizes such as a Lamborghini and a home worth $1 million. The expansion of Lucky Block&#8217;s NFT competition has directly benefited LBLOCK investors because it&#8217;s necessary to own the coin to enter competitions.</p>
<p>LBLOCK has provided significant capital appreciation to investors since its presale and then even more during the ICOs. New developments are constantly added to the network, benefiting investors and competition participants. The increased utility of Lucky Block should make the coin more in demand, so investors shouldn&#8217;t sleep on this project.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What could LBLOCK&#8217;s price be in 2025?</strong></p>
<p>Our Lucky Block forecast is that the coin should have a rally and set a new all-time high (ATH), thereby surpassing its current ATH of $0.0095. It&#8217;s possible that LBLOCK could reach $0.015 &#8211; $0.02 before it retraces to $0.003 during the next crypto winter.</p>
<p><strong>What price did Lucky Block start with?</strong></p>
<p>During the presale, investors could buy Lucky Block for $0.00015. The second phase of the presale pushed the price up to $0.00019. Then when Lucky Block listed on major exchanges, investors could buy it for $0.0008.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What was Lucky Block&#8217;s all time high?</strong></p>
<p>Lucky Block reached its highest price, $0.0095, in mid-February last year after rallying more than 1,100% since its ICO. The bull run started a few days after the coin&#8217;s listing on exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>How do I invest in Lucky Block?</strong></p>
<p>Investors can buy Lucky Block from centralized and decentralized exchanges. Some of the exchanges listing LBLOCK are PancakeSwap, LBank, MEXC, Gate.io and Uniswap. More exchange listings are expected to follow in the near future. </p>

<h2><strong>Analyzing the Top New Coins on Coinbase</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Let&#8217;s find out what these new coins coming to Coinbase have to offer investors.</p>
<h3>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Top Potential Coinbase Listing With Market-Driven Roadmap</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is our #1 choice as a potential Coinbase listing, for several relevant reasons. </p>
<p>This is a utility-focused ERC20 presale with a roadmap that corresponds with key events in the wider economy. The main roadmap milestone is the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>If this occurs, the presale could undergo vast increases in trade volume and price levels. This could certainly prompt Coinbase to list the token. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130890" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Homepage" width="900" height="439" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699956357-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-09-49-54-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The campaign was created specifically for anticipated BTC ETF approvals. So it stands to reason that it will appreciate by more than the majority of other crypto assets if it comes to pass, something which many experts have suggested might happen over the coming weeks. </p>
<p>There has been significant hype over the past couple of months regarding this approval, and Bitcoin ETF Token could easily benefit by association. The campaign has a roadmap that corresponds with important events in the larger crypto market, such as the price of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 and the overall AUM of the BTC ETF market hitting $1 billion. </p>
<p>With each of these milestones, 5% of the supply is burned to promote token scarcity, for a 25% burn overall. Aside from aggressive token burning, the presale offers a 450% PoS APY as well as a structured price increase from round one to round ten.</p>
<p><iframe title="New BITCOIN ETF 10X Potential Crypto Presale?! (WHY THIS MIGHT 10X?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NhSSPSzmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In the first round, the price per token is $0.0050. By the final round, round ten, the price will rise to $0.0068, a definite increase just shy of 40%. There are 840 million tokens available in the presale out of the total 2.1 billion supply.</p>
<p>None of the token supply has been withheld by a central team and the smart contract audit results were highly encouraging. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Exciting Stake-to-Mine Token That Has Raised $2.7M in its Presale</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is a high-potential crypto presale that has raced past the $2.7 million milestone in less than one month since it launched.</p>
<p>The project offers novel utility and is Web3&#8217;s first stake-to-mine protocol, tokenizing Bitcoin cloud mining to make the space safer and easier to manage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="438" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123006" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Presale Page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-300x146.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-768x374.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698669697-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-12-40-33-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Over time, Bitcoin mining has become the preserve of multi-billion-dollar mining firms, with the average cost of mining one BTC currently costing over $30k, due to the cost of equipment, processing power and energy consumption.</p>
<p>Cloud mining &#8211; where costs are shared or processing power rented &#8211; was a potential solution but the space has been filled with scammers who lock unknowing customers into paying high up-front fees over many months and often add hidden and miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>By tokenizing the process, Bitcoin Minetrix allows BTCMTX holders to stake tokens to generate cloud mining credits that can then be spent on mining power. It takes much of the risk away and does away with fees and contracts &#8211; opening the sector up to retail investors, who can mine BTC for just $10 worth of tokens.</p>
<p>Through the presale, buyers can also choose to stake their tokens, with the current annual percentage yield (APY) estimated to be 215%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="357" class="alignnone wp-image-123317 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698681589-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-59-06.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698681589-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-59-06.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698681589-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-59-06-300x119.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698681589-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-15-59-06-768x305.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>2.8 billion of its 4 billion supply is available in this presale. The price per token is currently $0.0113. </p>
<p>The huge interest in its presale and speed with which it reached $2.7M could be a signal that the token eventually reaches major exchanges such as Coinbase.</p>
<p>Investors should read the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> or join the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix">Telegram group</a> for more info.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Meme Presale with Added Utility via Staking With Play-to-Earn Battle Arena, Over $</strong><strong>850K Raised So Far</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is another exciting presale that is a meme coin with a difference &#8211; offering staking rewards and a play-to-earn Battle Arena. The project, which has raised more than $850,000 so far, is offering a 112% staking APY during the presale. </p>
<p>It could be a potential Coinbase listing due to its novel approach and strong community focus. It offers the appeal of many memes under one roof. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="436" class="alignnone wp-image-122512 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40.png" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-300x145.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-768x372.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Its main feature, however, is the Battle Arena, where players can wager on the outcome of battles between characters representing popular meme coins such as Pepe and Floki. The play-to-earn game is underpinned by blockchain technology and AI, meaning all results are immutable, transparent, and fair, with winnings paid instantly.</p>
<p>As well as betting on the results of battles, there will also be side markets available to add depth, intrigue, and added skill to the game. Meme Kombat has been developed by a doxxed team and will have seasonal updates, with new characters, themes, and game modes added over time. Season One features eleven of the world&#8217;s most famous meme tokens. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="377" class="alignnone wp-image-122514 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58.png" alt="Meme Kombat tokenomics" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58-300x126.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659963-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-58-768x322.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>There are 120 million $MK tokens, with 60 million allocated to the presale. Of the remaining supply, 30% goes to the staking, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to community rewards.</p>
<p>Tokens cost $0.1667 at the current time, though this will rise to $0.183 soon. More price rises are likely throughout presale and upon exchange listing. </p>

<h3><strong>4. TG.Casino Token &#8211; Upcoming Crypto Casino with Staking Rewards and Buyback</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/en">TG.Casino</a> is an upcoming crypto casino that will offer additional benefits to players who invest in their native token, $TGC. </p>
<p>The Telegram-powered casino will offer secure and anonymous crypto gaming, with anonymous deposits and withdrawals &#8211; with no fees &#8211; thousands of slots, a classic casino and a full sportsbook.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/333523/tgcasino-750.jpg" alt="TG Casino token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The main draw, however, is that TGC will allow players to earn huge staking rewards as well as earn casino profits via its buyback.</p>
<p>TG.Casino will go a step further than Rollbit &#8211; where native token $RLB pumped to a $70 million market cap after announcing a buyback &#8211; by not only offering staking and a buyback to share profits, but also one that will burn tokens.</p>
<p>Those who stake TGC will see profits shared among them, with 60% of purchased tokens distributed to players. </p>
<p>The remaining 40% will be sent to a burn address, which makes the supply deflationary which, over time, helps to increase the value of the token.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/333524/tg-casino-rewards.jpg" alt="TG Casino tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The token presale has, so far, raised more than $750k with a huge number of taken locked inside the staking pool, which is offering an APY of 625%.</p>
<p>The casino is fully licensed and regulated in Curacao, although some players will need a VPN. More info can be found in the <a href="https://tg-casino.gitbook.io/tg.casino-whitepaper/">whitepaper</a> or <a href="https://t.me/TG_CasinoCommunity">Telegram community</a> group.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Hot New Meme Coin with Over $75 Million Market Cap</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> ($WSM) enjoyed one of the biggest crypto presales and is now flying high on exchanges meaning it could be set for Coinbase soon.</p>
<p>Having sold more than $25 million of tokens during its presale, the meme coin is now available on multiple exchanges and has a market cap of $75 million &#8211; in fact, it only trails Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe in trading volume. High volume is usually a requirement for listing on major exchanges.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/329175/wall-street-memes-7.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes characters" /></figure>
<p>The Wall Street Memes token follows its 2021 NFT collection that <a href="https://thedalesreport.com/crypto-nfts/wall-street-bulls-nft-collection-sells-out-in-half-an-hour/"><u>sold out on Ethereum in just 30 minutes</u></a>. The project&#8217;s ambition was redirected towards capitalizing on the popular meme coin trend, a recent crypto niche that has grown substantially.</p>
<p>Influential figures, including Elon Musk, have engaged with Wall Street Memes on Twitter, boosting its profile, with their social media following standing at more than a million across platforms.</p>
<p>With this growing following and mega volume, the token looks set to be a major gainer in the next crypto bull run having already enjoyed a 275% despite launching in a bear market.</p>
<p>Although meme coin investment can be risky, projects with solid community backing often fare well and has helped boost the profile and interest in the WSM token.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/277446/screenshot-2023-05-26-at-.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes WSM token" /></figure>
<p>According to the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes whitepaper</u></a>, the platform’s token has a max supply of 2 billion, tiny for a meme coin. Importantly, no team allocation suggests a community-driven approach and resistance to rug pulls, with the project also fully audited by SolidProof.</p>
<p>Another major feature of Wall Street Memes is its staking pool, which has seen huge interest and is currently offering an estimated APY of 40% at the time of writing.</p>
<p>In fact, more than 400 million tokens &#8211; 20% of the total supply &#8211; is locked in the pool, highlighting investor confidence in the long-term potential of the project.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; Access Multiple Web3 Services through this Crypto Platform </strong></h3>
<p>While Web3 adoption is rising, it can be challenging to understand the range of services that this space provides. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a> curates the entry process by providing a single entry point for a suite of services. </p>
<p>On Launchpad XYZ, users can access a decentralized exchange to trade different cryptos and access crypto pairs. By leveraging $LPX, the native token, one can access discounts on trading fees. Launchpad XYZ also allows users to create their own Web3 wallets, which can be created after providing a phone number or email address. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/329177/screenshot-2023-09-05-134523.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Through the wallet, users can interact with different DApps (Decentralized Applications), swap tokens, and sign into different Web3 services. With Launchpad XYZ, users can also search through every available NFT marketplace. </p>
<p>One can identify which upcoming NFT release has high potential, access exclusive deals, and curate a collection on the NFT Gallery. Members can also access NFT whitelists if they stake a minimum monthly average of 10,000 $LPX tokens. </p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ offers more use cases than multiple cryptocurrencies despite being a new token. For instance, users can purchase NFTs with $LPX, and take loans against their assets as collateral. </p>
<p>New traders can access the Learn2Earn feature, where they can participate in Launchpad XYZ’s internal trading game, and learn and test new trading strategies. Top users can earn NFTs through this feature, and utilize them to earn discounts on platform fees. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/273393/launchpad-img.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ web3 project" /></figure>
<p>The presale has now raised more than $1.85 million, while one of its main features &#8211; an alpha signals group on Telegram &#8211; has offered multiple 1,000%-plus calls in recent weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>7. eTukTuk &#8211; Eco Friendly Presale Focused on Sustainable Transport in Impoverished Regions, 40% Community Sale Bonus</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> is an initiative that aims to remedy the damage caused by TukTuk vehicles in Sri Lanka and the surrounding areas. TukTuks are a common means of transport in these regions, and they are far more damaging to the environment as compared to regular vehicles. </p>
<p>Because of this, eTukTuk aims to replace these vehicles with an upgraded kind of electric vehicles which can be charged at designated regions and maintained by territory partners.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/328405/screen-shot-2023-09-07-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk TUK token presale page" /></figure>
<p>Sri Lanka rates quite poorly in terms of environmental pollution, as do many countries in Asia that rely on such vehicles. So this has become a matter of national concern and the campaign hopes to partner with government departments and commercial entities.</p>
<p>Aside from the environmental aspect, eTukTuk is aspiring to remedy socio economic barriers. eTukTuk drivers do not earn much of an income and spend a lot of it on fuel, but the new vehicles are far more affordable. Drivers can use the Tuk token for purchases and stake the token for rewards.</p>
<p>On an international level, the launch of such vehicles will help to place Sri Lanka on the map economically, with less reliance on fuel and better standing as a result of an improved CO2 profile.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/328406/screen-shot-2023-09-07-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk electric vehicle" /></figure>
<p>The project has raised $80,000 and tokens are available at a 40% discount. This is likely the lowest possible price to ever get the token, as the price will increase in subsequent fundraising rounds. </p>
<p>The price per token is $0.024 and this presale accepts many cryptos as payment &#8211; ETH, BNB, USDC, USDT, or ADA. It has also been audited by Certik.</p>
<p>To learn more about this presale, stay in touch with the <a href="https://twitter.com/TukToken"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>Telegram</u></a> accounts. You can also read the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf"><u>eTukTuk whitepaper</u></a> to understand the risks and benefits of eTukTuk investment. </p>
<p>The price will increase to $0.028 in the next phase. </p>

<h3><strong>8. Chimpzee &#8211; Monkey On a Mission to Save The World, Donates $15,000 &amp; Plants 20,000 Trees, $1.55 Million Raised in Presale</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/en"><u>Chimpzee (CHMPZ)</u></a> is a proactive presale that has already donated $15,000 to wildlife conservation while planting over 20,000 trees to save the rainforest. </p>
<p>These are significant contributions and it&#8217;s impressive that this campaign has already made an impact, even while the presale is ongoing. Most presales make a  lot of promises that never deliver, even after completion.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/328401/screen-shot-2023-09-07-at.jpg" alt="Chimpzee token presale page" /></figure>
<p>10% of all proceeds go towards environmentally concerned charities. The project has also undergone a <a href="https://sourcehat.com/audits/ChimpzeeCoin/"><u>third party smart contract audit</u></a> as well as attained a <a href="https://github.com/coinscope-co/kyc/blob/main/chmpz/kyc.png"><u>KYC Certificate from Coinscope</u></a>. Taking all these factors into account, this is not a typical presale that is only concerned with profits, but a real initiative for planetary conservation.</p>
<p>The goal of Chimpzee, as outlined in its whitepaper, is to raise funds and awareness for animal protection and forestry, while also allowing users to earn an income. Chimpzee provides three ways to earn an income &#8211; Play-To-Earn, Trade-To-Earn, and Shop-To-Earn.</p>
<p>The best way to earn an income is through a Diamond NFT passport, which allows for staking rewards of 20%. Other NFT passports &#8211; such as the Silver and Bronze &#8211; only allow for a 15% or 10% staking yield.</p>
<p>Chimpzee further engages in an aggressive token burning strategy that can serve to encourage price appreciation. It has already burned over 100 billion tokens and aims to burn all the way down to 50 billion.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/328404/screen-shot-2023-09-07-at.jpg" alt="Chimpzee crypto project" /></figure>
<p>There is no buying or selling tax, and no fees. The current price per CHMPZ is $0.001, significantly less than the listing price of $0.00185. Early entry is preferable from an economic standpoint.</p>

This presale accepts a large variety of Web3 wallets. Payment can be made with ETH, USDT, or Credit Card. $1.55 million out of its $1.8 million hard cap has been raised so far. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Scorpion Casino &#8211; Allows Indirect Casino Ownership, $10,000 Daily Staking Rewards, and 40% in Casino Credits</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/scorpion-casino/en"><u>Scorpion Casino (SCORP)</u></a> is a casino token presale that is all set for completion. It has achieved its $1 million hard cap but it is still possible to invest at the current time, so this is the very last chance for entry before it lists on a major exchange such as Coinbase. The current price is $0.017 and the listing price is $0.05. So if it does list on Coinbase you could pay nearly 3x more for it.</p>
<p>The idea behind Scorpion Casino is that it democratizes the market to make it accessible for everybody. Traditionally, the only way to make money from a casino was to own it. The SCORP token allows holders to take part in casino revenue. The more the casino earns, the bigger the rewards, to a maximum of $10,000 daily.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/328409/screen-shot-2023-09-07-at.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino token presale page" /></figure>
<p>$SCORP aims to be the leading token for the entire casino industry. It offers 30,000 betting opportunities monthly as well as 210 casino games, and 160 live games. Over 35 different sports are integrated into the platform. Scorpion Casino is provably fair, regulated, and transparent.</p>
<p>The team behind Scorpion Casino has been verified by Assure DeFi a Gold Standard, pecialist within Web3 KYC protocols. The casino platform is also licensed by the Curacao EGaming Authority and audited by Solidproof.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/328410/screen-shot-2023-09-07-at.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino project security" /></figure>
<p>Scorpion Casino accepts 4 major Web3 wallets for its presale &#8211; MetaMask, Wallet Connect, Trust Wallet, and CoinBase Wallet. Payment can be made in ETH, USDT, or BNB. Full details are outlined in the <a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/static/media/Whitepaper.ac4ceb28f62e7fb2bb01.pdf"><u>whitepaper</u></a>, which discloses all the risks.

<p>The VeChain ecosystem claims to provide a complete view of all necessary data linked to a product and its business processes &#8211; storage, transportation, supply &#8211; to specific stakeholders and create greater market transparency. </p>
<p>For instance, the blockchain could be used to track the quality, authenticity, storage temperature, transportation medium, and last-mile delivery of a food product or vaccine right from the manufacturing facility,  to the very last mile where it is received by the customer. </p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, VeChain uses smart chips or Radio Frequency Identification tags/ sensors that broadcast key information over the blockchain network. This can be accessed in real-time by stakeholders that have authorization. </p>
<p>The blockchain itself also has some impressive stats. The cost per transaction is minuscule, at just $0.0015. Since 2018, there has not been a single outage. Its carbon footprint is tiny, claiming to be just 0.04% of other blockchains. It aims to integrate sustainability into its business model while working with enterprise level platforms. </p>

<h2><strong>How Often Does Coinbase Add New Cryptocurrencies?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>Upcoming coins on Coinbase can be listed at any time because the exchange doesn&#8217;t have a fixed interval for new coin listings. </strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-upcoming-icos.htm">upcoming ICO cryptos</a> is that Coinbase has expedited its process for listings. A key reason for that is competition from major exchanges boasting a large range of coins and a desire to satisfy customer demand. </p>
<p>Although the process has sped up, upcoming Coinbase listings are carefully vetted to ensure project legitimacy and long-term investment potential.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89532/225015/coinbase-plat.jpg" alt="Coinbase exchange sign up" /></figure>
<p>At the peak of Coinbase&#8217;s popularity, new cryptos added to the exchange surged because its listings were regarded as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long term crypto investment</a> after thorough screenings.</p>
<h2><strong>Why You Should Buy Coins Before They List on Coinbase</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>One of the key reasons investors should buy new cryptos coming to Coinbase before their listing is to ensure more affordable prices. A Coinbase listing is likely to pump the price exponentially, especially on the first day when everyone is trying to lock in the lowest prices. </strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coinbase is one of the largest crypto exchanges, serving millions of customers in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, securing tokens early &#8211; especially during presales &#8211; can lead to even larger gains over investing once a token has already found an established following.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Invest in New Coinbase Cryptos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Considering we mentioned that it&#8217;s best to buy Coinbase upcoming listings before the coin trades on the exchange, we provided a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) during the presale.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Download Crypto Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Investors will need to have a crypto wallet such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect to buy $BTCETF tokens.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Purchase Compatible Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>The token is not yet listed on any exchanges, but one can purchase the token by swapping it with ETH, USDT, MATIC or BNB via its presale website.</p>
<p>ETH is the best option as it is needed to cover gas fees and can be bought directly on any trusted exchange or broker and transferred to the wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Connect to the Website and Purchase $BTCETF</strong></h3>
<p>Next, investors must connect to the Bitcoin ETF Token presale website. Once they have signed in, select the correct option and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
<p>At this point, the buyer has to decide whether to immediately stake tokens &#8211; with the current APY sitting at 450% &#8211; or not.</p>
<p>Click on the token you wish to swap $BTCETF with, and enter the transaction amount. You must leave enough of the token to cover the gas fees with, which might amount to $5 or $10. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Claim $BTCETF Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Once the presale is finished, $BTCETF tokens can be claimed from the presale website &#8211; details will be announced by the project closer to the time.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Purchasing tokens before they reach Coinbase can be a good way to secure gains, with the &#8216;Coinbase effect&#8217; often seeing tokens pump in price after they are listed with the exchange.</p>
<p>One of the new tokens that could be listed on Coinbase is $BTCETF &#8211; the native token of Bitcoin ETF Token. This is an extremely promising presale given the hype that surrounds BTC ETF approval at present.</p>
<p>The token is positioning itself for this event to occur and could benefit tremendously should it materialize. Moreover, it provides strong investment incentives such as a high APY and a powerful 25% token burn to promote scarcity. </p>

<p><strong>What new coins are coming to Coinbase?</strong></p>
<p>Crypto projects such as Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, Meme Kombat, Wall Street Memes, and TG.Casino Token could potentially be listed on Coinbase.</p>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve listed the cryptos with the fastest growth, let&#8217;s get into their details to find out the mechanics behind the projects.</p>
<h3><b>1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) &#8211; Fastest Growing Cryptocurrency to Hold For High Staking Rewards</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is the fastest growing cryptocurrency in 2023. Recently, $BTCETF has just been launched on presale &#8211; and has raised more than $550K in only one week. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1311" height="609" class="aligncenter wp-image-130984" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699961225-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-2-45-44-pm.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699961225-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-2-45-44-pm.png 1311w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699961225-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-2-45-44-pm-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699961225-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-2-45-44-pm-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699961225-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-2-45-44-pm-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1699961225-screen-shot-2023-11-14-at-2-45-44-pm-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1311px) 100vw, 1311px" /></p>
<p>This cryptocurrency has been created to celebrate the arrival of a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). The first Bitcoin ETF has yet to be approved by the SEC. Bitcoin ETF Token will offer rewards and conduct token burning events, as each of the following 5 milestones are completed: </p>
<ul>
<li>SEC approves the first Bitcoin ETF </li>
<li>The first Bitcoin ETF gets launched</li>
<li>Bitcoin ETF reaches $1 billion in assets under management</li>
<li>Bitcoin closes at a high of $100K</li>
<li>$BTCETF completes $100 million in trading volume </li>
</ul>
<p>As each of these milestones are completed, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 5% of its token supply &#8211; 25% in total. Another 25% of the token supply will be allocated through staking rewards. In total, Bitcoin ETF Token has a total supply of 2.1 billion tokens. </p>
<p>40% of the tokens are currently being distributed across ten presale rounds. Each presale round will offer 84 million tokens. At the time of writing, $BTCETF is priced at just $0.0052 per token. The price will increase to $0.0068 by the final round. </p>

<p>Once you purchase tokens from the presale, you can also stake your holdings to generate passive income. By locking $BTCETF on a verified smart contract, you can earn up to 450% in APYs (Annual Percentage Yields). </p>
<p>The staking yields and the successful start to the presale can make Bitcoin ETF Token one of the fastest growing cryptos right now.

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) &#8211; Earn Cloud Mining Credits with this Stake-to-Mine Crypto, Price Will Rise By 15% on Presale </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX) is a new cryptocurrency that adopts a revolutionary stake-to-mine mechanism &#8211; allowing individuals to access crypto mining power in a cost-effective and transparent manner. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/334673/screen-shot-2023-10-23-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Presale Page" /></figure>
<p>Individuals can access rented mining times without the hassle of purchasing mining equipment through a process known as cloud mining. However, the centralized companies that allocate mining time often engage in dubious activities to scam investors. Bitcoin Minetrix is decentralizing this process by recording cloud mining credits as ERC-20 tokens on the blockchain. </p>
<p>Thus, user’s have autonomy and cannot be scammed out of their holdings. To earn the cloud mining credits, users must buy and stake $BTCMTX tokens. The tokens can currently be purchased via the Bitcoin Minetrix presale. $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0112, but will increase by 15.17% to $0.0129 by the final presale round. </p>
<p>After purchasing $BTCMTX, token holders can stake their assets on an Ethereum-powered smart contract to generate the ERC-20 cloud mining credits. While these tokens cannot be traded, Bitcoin Minetrix allows users to burn the token to acquire Bitcoin cloud mining power. The mining power is used to earn a portion of crypto and Bitcoin mining revenues. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/334674/bitcoin-minetrix-cloud-mining.jpg" alt="Decentralized Cloud Mining With Bitcoin Minetrix" /></figure>
<p>So far, Bitcoin Minetrix has already raised over $2.1 million since the presale launch. From a low supply of 4 billion tokens, 2.8 billion are allocated for the presale. This gives investors ample opportunity to enter the presale before the exchange listing takes place. </p>
<p>This crypto is also selling out at a rapid pace due to the passive income-earning opportunities. By staking $BTCMTX &#8211; one can also earn annual yields as high as 270%.

<p>A meme cryptocurrency that offers multiple use cases &#8211; <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/visit/memekombat">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) has been soaring since the start of its presale. This platform leverages artificial intelligence to offer users with an immersive battle arena. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331122/screenshot-2023-09-21-151052.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat Staking Process" /></p>
<p>On the battle arena, users can fight other players by leveraging various meme coin avatars. The <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper/">Meme Kombat whitepaper</a> states that the battle arena will be released in different seasons. The first season will be launched after the end of the $MK presale and will feature 11 meme coin characters. </p>
<p>Players can fight other friends through the Player vs Player mode and up the stakes by wagering $MK tokens on battles. Tokens can also be wagered on Player vs Game modes, and other live battles taking place on the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Priced at only $0.1667 on presale, Meme Kombat has allocated 60 million tokens from its total 120 million supply. Once you purchase $MK on presale, your holdings are automatically staked on a staking contract. The live APY (Annual Percentage Yield) of staking $MK is 112%. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/331123/screenshot-2023-09-21-151109.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat Tokenomics Allocation" /></p>
<p>After the presale ends, staked token holders must re-stake their holdings for one lock-up period to earn the staking rewards. The lock-up period on Meme Kombat is only 14 days. Since the start of the presale, Meme Kombat has raised more than $730K. </p>
<p>Another 30% of the token supply will be allocated through staking and battle rewards. 10% of the supply will be offered through community rewards, and the remaining tokens will be allocated for the DEX listing. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes —  Fastest Growing Crypto in 2023 With a Huge $25 Million Presale Raise</strong></h3>
<p>We continue our review with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a>, a coin inspired, in part, by the GameStop craze. Thanks to social media, the project was in the spotlight even before its presale in May 2023. </p>
<p>This popularity, along with its branding and mission, has helped it raise over $25 million in just twelve weeks &#8211; making it the fastest-growing crypto on our list.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/312837/image1-27.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes History" /></figure>
<p>Wall Street Memes was conceived by Wall Street Bulls&#8217; creators, a team of developers who rose to prominence in 2021. The brand originated from the Wall Street Bets subreddit that discussed investment strategies and trading tactics. </p>
<p>Wall Street Memes was an offshoot that shared funny memes and content and now has more than a million followers on social media &#8211; with Elon Musk a known fan having interacted with the page on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Their first endeavor in crypto was the Wall Street Bulls NFT collection that sold 10,000 non-fungible tokens in only 32 minutes and then sold out a Bitcoin Ordinals NFT collection. </p>
<p>It looks like WSM is on the same path with its huge early success and hype around the project. The network’s aim to “tokenize” meme popularity struck a chord with numerous crypto enthusiasts. It even managed to gain support from various influential figures, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954"><u>including Elon Musk</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/319900/wall-street-memes-2.jpg" alt="Buy Or Sell With Wall Street Memes" /></figure>
<p>Even with this initial success, WSM has a long way to go. Its <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>whitepaper </u></a>describes a 30-stage presale and plans for future listings on DEX and CEX, partnerships, expansions, exclusive content, and more. Users can get a sense of what’s to come by participating in WSM’s first airdrop. The giveaway will split $50,000 worth of tokens between five lucky winners by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>If you’d like to join, you can follow the group on various social networks like <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram</u></a>. Purchasing its native coins will help your winning chances. </p>
<p>$WSM is available to buy on the OKX and Huobi exchanges.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Chimpzee (CHMPZ) &#8211; Fastest Growing Passive Income Crypto That Saves the Planet</strong></h3>
<p><a href="/ext/chimpzee/"><u>Chimpzee</u></a> is another one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2023. The project provides a passive income to its users while simultaneously making charitable donations to organizations focused on preventing global warming and saving wildlife. </p>
<p>The entire premise behind the project is to use Web3 to increase public awareness of the dangers of global warming while providing financial contributions to notable charities, including The Giving Block, One Tree Planted, and the Wild Foundation. More than $1.3m has been raised so far.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/275725/image1.jpg" alt="Chimpzee Organizational Partners" /></figure>
<p>The project is centered around Max Chimpzeeski’s creation &#8211; a brilliant scientist with a heart of gold born in the depths of the African jungle &#8211; who’s on a mission to save the planet from climate change. Max has used his genius to create a Web3 weapon called Chimpzee that uses a vibrant ecosystem that protects nature, helps save the forests and benefits mankind.</p>
<p>The brilliant scientist has combined three components of Web3 &#8211; Shop-to-Earn, Trade-to-Earn, and Play-to-Earn &#8211; to create an ecosystem that provides a passive income to NFT holders and gives back to charitable organizations.</p>
<p>The Chimpzee shop is the Shop-to-Earn component and is the central commerce center that allows users to earn CHMPZ tokens on branded goods in the store. A percentage of all profits are donated to charities that share our mission.</p>
<p>The NFT Marketplace is the Trade-to-Earn component. It will be the first NFT marketplace in the world that shares a percentage of the trading fees with active users on the platform. Chimpzee NFT passport holders will receive a large share.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/275726/image2.jpg" alt="Chimpzee Ecosystem Earning Mechanisms" /></p>
<p>The Play-to-Earn component is the Chimpzee Zero Tolerance game, a fun P2E game that is the main entertainment component of the ecosystem which allows users to earn CHMPZ tokens when they reach certain milestones. Players that use their NFT Passport in the game receive boosted rewards to earn more tokens.</p>
<p>The project is currently hosting a presale for the CHMPZ tokens and is expected to explode once the ecosystem starts to make donations to charity. Free Bonus tokens will be available only during the presale. 10% of the total coin supply will also be donated to charity to help bootstrap the charitable side of the project. </p>

<p>The ecosystem of Scorpion Casino revolves around three core elements: the Scorpion Casino platform, the affiliate system, and the SCORP token.

<h3><strong>7. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; All-in-One Web3.0 Cryptocurrency Ecosystem </strong></h3>
<p>With the rapid development of the Web3.0 sector, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a> aims to release an ecosystem that will make different services accessible through one portal. The platform will deploy its own token, $LPX, to maintain the ecosystem, offer discounts on trading, and access to other environments. </p>
<p>This cryptocurrency is available for only $0.0445 through the ongoing presale. Currently, on round one of a ten-stage presale, the price of $LPX will jump to $0.7. This equates to a 100% price increase. From a 1 billion total supply, 250 million tokens have been allocated for the presale. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/275250/lpx-price-312k.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ Crypto Homepage" /></figure>
<p>The token can be used within Launchpad XYZ’s NFT decentralized exchange to avail trading discounts. Users that stake at least 1,000 $LPX monthly can also get access to more partner discounts. </p>
<p>Users can access hundreds of crypto trading pairs through the decentralized exchange and take out perpetual contracts. Launchpad XYZ will also offer its own Web3 wallet. This can be registered by entering an email address or phone number. </p>
<p>Through the Web3 wallet, users can access new Web3.0 presale listings on the ecosystem. Those that stake $LPX will get guaranteed access to the listings. The tokens will be claimed and transferred directly to the wallet. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/275251/launchpad-web3.jpg" alt="Launchpad Home of Web3" /></figure>
<p>The wallet can also be used to interact with other DApps (Decentralized Applications), swap tokens, and get self-custody of your assets. Another feature of Launchpad XYZ is its NFT site. Users can directly access the top NFT marketplaces through the platform and curate their own NFT collections. </p>
<p>One can use $LPX to purchase fractionalized assets, which include items of historical value such as art and real estate. Since the Launchpad XYZ presale started, the project has raised around $1.5 million.</p>

<h3><strong>8. yPredict &#8211; Next-Gen Crypto Trading and Analytics Platform </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> gives users access to various data-driven marketing insights through its financial marketplace. One can purchase monthly subscriptions with $YPRED, the native token on presale. </p>
<p>Since the presale started, the token has raised more than $3.8 million and is in its penultimate stage.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/275248/ypredict-home.jpg" alt="yPredict Trading Terminal" /></figure>
<p>On the financial marketplace, predictive models are provided by AI developers and researchers. These models give a future outlook on how certain digital assets may perform. The platform leverages AI tools such as sentiment analysis to determine the popularity of various digital assets. </p>
<p>yPredict even has a patent pending chart recognition algorithm, which dictates whether a certain coin is bullish or bearish. Other features include AI trading signals and technical indicators. The $YPRED token is rushing through its presale due to the different use cases it provides. </p>
<p>For instance, existing token holders can earn a potentially high APY (Annual Percentage Yield) by staking $YPRED. 10% of the revenue generated through new subscriptions is distributed to existing customers. Furthermore, 15% of the platform’s swapping fees are sent to a staking pool. </p>
<p>On yPredict, users can also join a play-to-earn ecosystem. On this ecosystem, members can make directional bets on the future of various tokens. The best performers are rewarded with $YPRED as a reward. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/275249/ypredict-features.jpg" alt="yPredict Tools And Features" /></figure>
<p>Furthermore, yPredict will also offer a Learn2Earn ecosystem. Users can increase their knowledge through this platform by taking quizzes and assessments. Every time you successfully take an assessment, you earn $YPRED tokens. </p>
<p>Thus, many have been purchasing $YPRED through the presale due to all these different use cases.</p>
<p>Currently, the token is priced at $0.10 per token and by the next stage &#8211; which is the final one &#8211; the price will jump by 20% to $0.12.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Polygon (MATIC) &#8211; Ethereum-compatible Network Providing Layer 2 Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Polygon&#8217;s platform connects Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its key function solves problems regarding slow speeds and high gas fees, which many crypto projects have experienced.</p>
<p>The appealing factor of Polygon is that it solves the speed and fees issues many blockchain users experience without compromising security. The project&#8217;s founders built Polygon on top of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum.htm">Ethereum blockchain</a>, enabling it to process Ethereum-based transactions while offering scalability.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/319903/polygon.jpg" alt="Polygon Web3 Homepage" /></figure>
<p>Polygon&#8217;s transactions are processed faster because it functions on a separate blockchain. And the best part is that Polygon&#8217;s transactions are cheaper than Ethereum&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons for this project&#8217;s adoption growth is the ability of developers to create decentralized applications. Polygon&#8217;s platform is also used for NFT launches and several big corporations have launched NFT collections and Web 3.0 projects on the Polygon network. Wondering where to buy MATIC in 2023? The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm">best crypto apps</a> offer the most popular digital assets as well as a secure crypto wallet.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>10. Solana (SOL) &#8211; Smart Contract Platform Offering High Transaction Speeds</strong></h3>
<p>Solana is possibly the fastest growing crypto coin, having provided early investors with more than 20,000% returns. SOL&#8217;s hype isn&#8217;t merely based off celebrity endorsement, but the token solves a massive problem.</p>
<p>It provides high transaction speeds at a low cost. Investors use SOL to pay transaction fees on the network and enjoy smart contracts. Solana is an ever-expanding project, as it aims to improve blockchain scalability.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/319904/solana.jpg" alt="Start Building With Solana" /></figure>
<p>By using proof-of-stake and proof-of-history technology. Solana plans to develop its network to process more than 60,000 transactions per second. The fees for using Solana&#8217;s network are mere pennies. </p>
<p>Investors who <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins.htm">buy Bitcoin</a> can incur fees of more than $50 and wait several hours for the transfer to reflect, depending on network usage and other factors. The key advantage of using Solana is that investors enjoy fast, affordable and scalable transactions.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>11. Decentraland (MANA) </strong>&#8211; <strong>Metaverse Gaming Platform with DAO Governance</strong></h3>
<p>Decentraland&#8217;s mission was to build the first ever virtual world owned by its users. Joining this game enables players to explore LANDs, divided into 90,000 parcels, to traverse through fascinating scenery and structures. </p>
<p>Players build up their lands as they please, and some of the interesting infrastructure found in Decentraland are medieval dungeon mazes and villages. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/319905/decentraland.jpg" alt="Decentraland Virtual Metaverse" /></figure>
<p>The game enables players to acquire more land with the platform&#8217;s native token, MANA. Players can also use the builder tool to create scenes, artworks and challenges &#8211; even charging a fee for other players to enter.</p>
<p>A key attraction of this NFT game is that a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governs its policies, stipulating how the platform functions, and the demand for Decentraland&#8217;s parcels increased drastically in 2021.</p>
<p>It appears that the demand and growth of this platform are set to continue in 2023, where Decentraland has announced partnerships with big corporations, enabling them to purchase digital land and advertise their brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong>Buy MANA on eToro</strong></a></p>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>12. Ripple (XRP)- Efficient Cross-Border Payments Solution Partnering with Banks</strong> </h3>
<p>Ripple is a fintech company based in San Francisco, determined to provide effective payment solutions to users globally. XRP, its native token, was designed to help people receive money efficiently and at a low cost.</p>
<p>It has managed to provide both, as XRP transactions take mere seconds to reflect on the other side of the world and cost pennies. Ripple&#8217;s goal of enabling peer-to-peer transacting has been achieved, but it has its sights on massive corporations.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/319906/xrp-1505.jpg" alt="XRP Offers Global Utility" /></figure>
<p>Although Ripple&#8217;s community, referred to as the XRP Army, has a large influence on the coin&#8217;s price movement, it&#8217;s the partnership with banks that increased adoption. </p>
<p>Numerous Asian banks and payment providers have partnered with Ripple to use XRP as a means to send large blocks of transactions across the world at a minimal cost &#8211; XRP&#8217;s price has proven to react favorably to Ripple&#8217;s partnerships.</p>
<p>The hindrance in XRP&#8217;s price has been Ripple&#8217;s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC &#8211; the US Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Ripple for sales of unregistered securities and has claimed that XRP is a security.</p>
<p>But XRP&#8217;s support from the army has led to a significant price pump, resulting in more than 1,300% returns for investors who bought the coin in March 2020 and held it until April 2021. That rally proved even a lawsuit cannot prevent XRP&#8217;s price from pumping.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>13.</strong> <strong>The Sandbox (SAND) &#8211; Asset-Building Game with Expanding User Base</strong> </h3>
<p>Another Metaverse game that has made a lot of noise with the NFT community is The Sandbox. This crypto game enables players to monetize their piece of LAND and use avatars to turn their NFT collection into a life-like form.</p>
<p>Owning LAND enables players to build experiences, host events and invite friends and they can also increase the value of their land by adding infrastructure and then selling it for profit. Players need to own $SAND, the game&#8217;s token, to buy and sell assets and land in the Metaverse.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86850/319907/sandbox.jpg" alt="Sandbox Asset Ownership" /></figure>
<p>The Sandbox&#8217;s user base grew significantly in 2021, with a wallet database reaching 500,000 and several thousand users spending more than an hour in The Sandbox, developing their land. </p>
<p>Another key development has been this game&#8217;s partnership with big brands, making it a key <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm">crypto to watch</a> in the future.</p>
<p>Some of the artists The Sandbox teamed up with are Snoop Dogg, DJ Richie Hawtin and Deadmau5. Another collaboration is with Adidas, which bought a piece of land on the platform to promote its brand.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i> </p>
<h2><strong>The Criteria for Ranking the Fastest Growing Cryptos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To determine the fastest growing cryptocurrencies, we used several factors. Let&#8217;s explore each of them in detail.</p>
<h3><strong>Supply</strong></h3>
<p>Assets high in demand are usually in low supply &#8211; investors struggle to buy them, so they&#8217;re willing to pay a premium for ownership. Scarce assets are valuable, and a finite supply, such as Bitcoin&#8217;s, makes investors eager to invest in the project.</p>
<h3><strong>Popularity</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the reason some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hottest-crypto-to-buy.htm">hottest cryptos</a> rallied is because of popularity, manifested from celebrity endorsements and strong social media backing.</p>
<p>Dogecoin is a perfect example, receiving Elon Musk and Mark Cuban&#8217;s backing, even though the coin had virtually no utility and was developed as a joke.</p>
<p>But Dogecoin&#8217;s popularity resulted in the coin going on an epic bull run, providing investors with more than 10,000% who bought coins at the beginning of 2021.</p>
<h3><strong>Age</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is the first crypto developed on the blockchain and has been around the longest. It&#8217;s one of the reasons it has the highest market cap of all coins and was one of the fastest growing crypto on Coinbase.</p>
<p>But new crypto projects have proven they can also make an impression on investors if they solve a real-world problem. </p>
<h3><strong>Utility</strong></h3>
<p>Some coins get away with providing almost no utility and managing to have significant price pumps- a good example being Dogecoin &#8211; but such coins lose their appeal fast and experience a massive price crash.</p>
<p>The only cryptocurrencies that can have longevity are the ones that provide utility and continued use case, either helping to solve a problem on the blockchain or providing continued entertainment.</p>
<h3><strong>Staking</strong></h3>
<p>Many investors now consider staking as one of the best ways to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-rich-off-crypto.htm">get rich off crypto</a>. Staking involves investors using the coins they own to earn more coins by locking them away on an exchange. Investors earn interest by staking their coins, which they can exchange for fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Not all coins can be staked, and some stake coins offer lower interest than others.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We&#8217;ve highlighted the key criteria for selecting the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies, and we applied them to all the cryptos featured in this guide. </p>
<p>One of the fastest growing cryptos is Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF). This new ERC-20 token is offering high staking yields through its smart contract &#8211; and will burn 25% of its token supply over time. In only a week, $BTCETF has raised over $550K from its token presale. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What qualifies as fast growing crypto?</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies that have experienced tremendous growth by raising large amounts of money during early funding, significant increases in wallet userbase, massive coin price spikes and transaction increases would make a crypto fast growing.</p>
<p><strong>Which crypto is the fastest growing this year?</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token is an exciting new crypto project which speculates on the upcoming arrival of a Bitcoin ETF. $BTCETF can be staked to earn high staking yields. The token supply will reduce by 25% over time. The token is currently available to buy during the early presale rounds. </p>
<p><strong>How do I know which cryptos will grow fast?</strong></p>
<p>A good indication of a crypto coin that may grow fast is usually evidenced in its presale &#8211; Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, Meme Kombat, and Wall Street Memes are clear examples of investors flocking to a presale.</p>
<p><strong>What cryptocurrency on Coinbase is the fastest growing?</strong></p>
<p>Several cryptocurrencies have provided massive returns for investors such as Bitcoin and Cardano. Solana is another coin that had a huge rally.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com</i></p>
<p>Earning optimal returns requires investors to buy assets at the lowest prices. Investors who didn&#8217;t get in on presales have another chance at low prices during the initial coin offering (ICO) &#8211; when a token is first launched for public sale.</p>
<p>New crypto projects are added to the blockchain almost daily, but investors need sound investments, so we discovered the best upcoming ICOs. With ICOs, as with presales, there is more risk than purchasing established coins as the projects are typically in the building stage and despite their high potential have no proven utility.</p>
<p>However, they typically offer much higher potential for growth and returns and are attractive to investors for exactly those reasons.</p>
<p>We compiled an upcoming ICO list and detailed each project&#8217;s features and benefits. Let&#8217;s find out more about how investors can potentially earn from new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">crypto ICOs</a> and what they entail.</p>

<h2><strong>What&#8217;s an ICO?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>An ICO is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering and is similar to when companies go public and offer shares during Initial Public Offerings (IPO) &#8211; the key difference is that crypto projects offer digital tokens instead of shares to raise capital.</p>
<p>Investors who didn&#8217;t partake in the presale of a project try to obtain the best prices of cryptos during ICOs. Upcoming ICOs in 2023 need to solve a real-world problem for the project to convince investors it&#8217;s a worthwhile investment.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87395/219937/jeremy-bezanger-9opihrpivr0-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="Coinbase stock price chart" /></figure>
<p>A key advantage of new ICO crypto over IPOs is that many elements of the crypto market remain unregulated. </p>
<p>That can be advantageous to the crypto project because it enables it to circumvent lengthy processes to register as a regulated entity, although crypto investment does come with increased risks over IPO investment.</p>
<h2><strong>The Mechanics of ICOs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>New ICOs for 2023 are available on numerous exchanges thanks to the increased adoption of blockchain technologies and crypto tokens. But how exactly do ICOs work?</p>
<p>ICOs occur on centralized exchanges, and the coin is listed once sufficient liquidity is reached. Even before that, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long term crypto projects</a> decide on how to structure the coin. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preset price and fixed supply: </strong>The project determines a preset price for the token and limits the supply.</li>
<li><strong>Variable price and fixed supply: </strong>The coin&#8217;s supply is fixed, but the market determines the price. The funding received determines the overall price per coin.</li>
<li><strong>Preset price and variable supply: </strong>Certain projects prefer to determine the price before the ICO, but the supply is based on the demand for the token.</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide insight about the project to investors, the developers release a whitepaper. It stipulates the coin&#8217;s utility, token rewards offered, the project&#8217;s mission, how it benefits investors and a roadmap of what the project wants to achieve during various stages.</p>
<p>Once the coin is listed on the exchange, investors need to open an account and fund it. New ICO crypto is most commonly paired with the US dollar. Investors input the amount of dollars they wish to exchange for the crypto and then open a buy position.</p>
<h2><strong>Detailed Review of Top New ICO Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve identified crypto projects with upcoming ICOs, let&#8217;s find out exactly what they offer and how investors could potentially benefit. </p>
<h3>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Top Upcoming ICO With A Discounted Presale Price And Market-Specific Roadmap Milestones</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is a recently launched ICO that has raised $500,000 in a week, out of its hard cap which is just under $5 million. </p>
<p>This presale centers around the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Should this take place, the campaign will be perfectly placed to benefit, and will likely appreciate by much more than other crypto assets. </p>
<p> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130370" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Homepage" width="900" height="443" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-768x378.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Few, if any, presales have such a direct connection with a regulatory event in the wider market. Most ICOs are self-contained ecosystems that exist independently of other phenomena. But Bitcoin ETF Token has a roadmap and a burning mechanism that is deeply connected to the wider crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>There are five milestones listed in the roadmap, as outlined in the official <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token Whitepaper</a><b>. </b>These milestones include events such as the price of BTC hitting $100,000, the total BTC ETF AUM reaching $1 billion, and the SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs. </p>
<p>5% of the total token supply is burned when a milestone is achieved, for a 25% burn overall. This deflationary mechanism could further serve to increase the price of the remaining coins. </p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token maintains a dedicated section on its website for key information relating to Bitcoin ETF approval. Further alerts and updates can be obtained from the <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Telegram</a> accounts. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130371" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Staking Information" width="900" height="373" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1-300x124.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1-768x318.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The total token allocation is 2.1 billion with 40% allocated to the presale, 25% allocated to staking, 25% to a burn address, and 10% to DEX liquidity.</p>
<p>There are 840 million tokens available in the presale at a discounted price of just $0.0052 in the current round (round two). This will rise to $0.0068 by round ten. </p>
<p>Along with this automatic price increase, the dynamic for this coin is 500%. These are powerful investment incentives that could add further value, along with the expected SEC approval that could 10x the coin, if market conditions allow. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) &#8211; High Quality Crypto ICO with Huge APY and Cloud Mining</strong></h3>
<p>One of the top cryptocurrency platforms circulating the market is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a>. This is a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency platform that converges two popular crypto niches &#8211; token staking and cloud mining. </p>
<p>The ICO has got off to a roaring start and already raised more than $2.2 million.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87395/332345/screen-shot-2023-10-02-at.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Crypto Project" /></figure>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix will reduce the entry barrier for mining activities by tokenizing cloud mining. Individuals do not need to purchase their own advanced equipment or hardware to mine Bitcoin and other cryptos. With Bitcoin Minetrix, one can simply purchase $BTCMTX &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>The tokens can be staked on an Ethereum-powered smart contract to generate a high yield. At press time, Bitcoin Minetrix offers over 270% in staking rewards. Furthermore, your staked tokens will help you generate cloud mining credits &#8211; ERC-20 non-tradable assets. The credits you collect can be burned on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin mining power. </p>
<p>The mining power is leveraged to get allocated mining times &#8211; returning your investment with a percentage of mining revenues. This process is cost-effective since the platform will leverage the cloud mining equipment of other companies. Since the credits are recorded and stored on the blockchain, Bitcoin Minetrix offers transparency to individuals. </p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix has recently launched $BTCMTC on presale. This ICO will consist of 39 rounds and offer 2.8 billion tokens. The goal is to collect a hard cap of $33 million. </p>
<p>The tokens are currently priced at $0.012 at the present time but will be priced at $0.0129 by the final stage. </p>

<h3><b>3. Meme Kombat (MK) &#8211; Wager and Earn Staking Rewards on this AI-Driven Battle Arena</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/">Meme Kombat</a> ($MK) is a new meme cryptocurrency that can be leveraged to earn rewards in an AI-based battle arena. The battle arena allows players to battle with multiple meme coin avatars. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-121742" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png" alt="Meme Kombat presale" width="900" height="418" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home.png 1439w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>$MK, the native token, can be wagered on this battle arena to bet on the outcome of the fights. By using various artificial intelligence tools, the battle arena offers dynamic visualization to portray realistic-looking fights. According to the Meme Kombat roadmap, the first season of the battle arena will feature 11 meme coin characters such as Pepe Coin and Spongebob. </p>
<p> Players can pick their preferred avatars and engage in Player vs Player and Player vs Game battles. Wagers can be made on your fights, or any other live battles taking place in the arena. $MK can also be staked via staking pools to earn high APYs (Annual Percentage Yields). The returns depend on your contribution compared to the overall staking pool. </p>
<p>Meme Kombat is offering 112% staking APYs to investors that buy $MK through the ongoing presale. The current ICO round has priced $MK at $0.1667 per token. As soon as you purchase tokens, they are automatically locked on Meme Kombat’s staking contract. </p>
<p>To earn the presale yields, investors must re-stake their holdings for one lock-up period after the presale ends. For a meme coin, Meme Kombat boasts a low supply of just 120 million. Furthermore, this community-driven project is allocating the entire token supply to the public. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/86635/331157/meme-kombat-tokenomics.jpg" alt="" width="1435" /></p>
<p>50% of the tokens are allocated for the presale, and another 40% will be offered through staking, battle, and community rewards. The remaining 10% of the supply has been set aside for DEX (Decentralized Exchange) allocation. </p>
<p>Meme Kombat has raised $920K since the presale launched. Read the <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper/">Meme Kombat whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/MemeKombatToken">Telegram channel</a> to stay updated with this new presale token. </p>

<h3><strong>5. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; Earn Staking Rewards and Reduce Air Pollution with this Upcoming ICO</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk</a> (TUK) is helping TukTuk drivers in developing countries make the switch from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The platform is doing it by setting up charging stations where payments can be made with $TUK, the native cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>The platform will allocate territories in various developing countries to set up electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSEs). Once the EV charging stations are launched, they will be compatible with ZEVs. Currently, more than 270 million TukTuks are running use ICEs, which contribute to huge air pollution and use fossil fuels. </p>

<p>According to eTukTuk, its energy-efficient network will help reduce the fees for TukTuk drivers by 75%. The Binance Smart Chain can process a high number of transactions and charges a small amount per transaction. Thus, TukTuk drivers will be able to take home approximately 400% more by using this network. </p>
<p>Territory partners will also be leveraged to locally operate and install EVSEs in various countries. They will be paid a percentage of each transaction that drivers make on the ecosystem. Token holders can earn an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) by staking $TUK tokens. </p>
<p>From a 2 billion token supply, eTukTuk will allocate 250 million tokens for the presale round, which launched last month and has now raised more than $120k.</p>

A token-burning mechanism sustains the healthy value of the token in the long term. </p>

<h3><strong>9. ScapesMania ($MANIA) &#8211; Merging the Best of Web 2 &amp; Web 3 Gaming To Reward Gamers</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://scapesmania.io/?utm_source=CryptoNews&amp;utm_medium=space&amp;utm_campaign=top10list"><u>ScapesMania</u></a> is an upcoming ICO bridging the gap between enthusiasts and casual gamers, offering an engaging gameplay experience.</p>
<p>The project recognizes the play-to-earn model&#8217;s challenges, from a rapidly declining user base to waning transaction volumes. ScapesMania sidesteps these issues by not being strictly play-to-earn; it combines the fun aspects of casual gaming with the economic benefits of blockchain.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87395/313911/scapesmania.jpg" alt="ScapesMania token presale" /></figure>
<p>Currently on presale, its native token, $MANIA, is selling out for $0.002. However, this price will rise to $0.003 in the next stage. Moreover, the platform also offers a bonus of up to 25% on $MANIA purchases. 30% of the total 4 billion tokens are allocated for the presale phase.</p>
<p>The game concept of ScapesMania is appealing. Players own a plot of land, decorate their homes, participate in contests, and interact with a vibrant community. The game offers a combination of land customization, mini-games, story progression, reputation building, and regular events.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://scapesmania.io/whitepaper.pdf"><u>ScapesMania whitepaper</u></a>, the essence of the platform lies in its two-tier audience approach. Web3 enthusiasts can participate in the project&#8217;s development through DAO governance and benefit from token buyback and burn events.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, casual gamers, the Web2 audience, are offered an engaging game without interacting with the project&#8217;s crypto aspect. This duality makes ScapesMania both enjoyable and rewarding.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87395/313712/screenshot-2023-06-19-at-.jpg" alt="ScapesMania Web3 Crypto Game" /></figure>
<p>The in-game economy of ScapesMania is well-established, comprising standard monetization techniques. It includes options such as direct and indirect purchases of unique objects, regular events that generate revenue, and season passes. These mechanics ensure the game&#8217;s longevity and economic viability.</p>
<p>The $MANIA token is central to ScapesMania, offering various utilities. It can be used in governance decisions, buyback, burn events, staking, and as in-game assets.</p>
<p>Users can enter the <a href="https://t.me/scapesmaniaAnn"><u>ScapesMania announcements Telegram group</u></a> to get the latest news on the project’s upcoming events.</p>

<p>When looking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-ico-tokens.htm">buy ICO tokens</a>, finding the most promising cryptos can be easier said than done. Investors can look in several places to find the best upcoming ICO. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/ico-calendar/">CoinMarketCap provides a calendar</a> of scheduled ICOs and even IDOs (initial decentralized offerings). </p>
<p>Social media is where most crypto projects announce to the masses about the offering and is a handy way of getting the word out quickly and spreading it to millions of people. </p>
<p>The crypto community is largely based on Twitter. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">Crypto on Reddit</a>, a popular social platform, is another source to locate ICOs, as are CoinGecko, CoinList and CoinSniper, which all have calendars similar to CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>To get an advantage over the market by locking in the best prices, investors should search for crypto presales. They provide insight into how a token may perform during its ICO, however, after finding ICOs it is vitally important to do further research on the projects. </p>
<p>Given the number of malicious operators in the space, investors must conduct due diligence to avoid being scammed on rug pulls or honey pots. You should read websites, whitepapers and roadmaps thoroughly &#8211; if they are poorly put together, unclear or vague, that is usually a red flag.</p>
<p>Doxxed teams usually indicate a project is honest, whereas hiding behind anonymity is another red flag. However, one exception to that rule is that many meme projects have anonymous &#8211; including Dogecoin and Pepe &#8211; so investors should take extra care by looking at other elements of the project.</p>
<p>Social media is also a good place to find opinions on a project, although beware of FUD, with large followings and activity a sign that a project has interest and buzz. However, you must also look out for bots and spammers and also always ensure you are sending funds to the correct contracts and not imitators with malicious intentions.</p>
<h2><strong>Is an ICO Coin a Worthwhile Investment?  </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto projects that solve real-world problems and make people&#8217;s lives more convenient tend to receive a lot of attention. </p>

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at the Best New Coin Launches</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We start off our list of the top new coin launches with some brand-new projects in the early phases of their presale:</p>
<h3>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Brand New Crypto Launched With Regulatory Focus And 25% Token Burn</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is a recently launched ERC20 presale with a focus on SEC ratification of Bitcoin ETFs in the USA. This is the main emphasis of this brand-new campaign. </p>
<p>Many industry professionals have insinuated that this approval should be forthcoming shortly, as soon as December 2023. Should it materialize, it would mean an influx of new funds into the crypto economy as well as a much-improved price profile for Bitcoin ETF Token. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-130370 aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Homepage" width="900" height="443" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-768x378.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877448-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-08-1-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This campaign is different from many others, due to its ties to an actual event in the wider economy, and one that could have major effects. In total, the Bitcoin ETF roadmap consists of five major milestones. These include the SEC ratification of BTC ETFs, the total AUM of the BTC ETF market hitting $1 billion, and the BTC price reaching $100,000.</p>
<p>At each milestone target, 5% of the total 2.1 billion supply is burned, for a total burn of 25%. This encourages upwards price momentum for the remaining coins, rewarding token holders. Aside from the 25% burn allocation, 40% (840 million) goes to the presale, 25% (525 million) to staking, and 10% (10 million) to DEX liquidity. </p>
<p>The campaign offers significant price appreciation through its presale, from $0.0050 in stage one to $0.0068 in stage ten &#8211; the current price is $0.006. Each stage offers 84 million tokens, with price increases at each.  Staking APY for this presale currently hovers above 125%. </p>
<p>More than $2 million has been raised in just three weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="New BTC ETF 10X Potential Crypto?! | Bitcoin Alternative With Staking Rewards!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/17pXZtSNHDM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The new market-driven presale is offering a new concept and the token could enjoy massive success if the SEC approval happens, as that is exactly what the campaign has been designed for. Aside from this, it provides powerful APY, predetermined presale price increases, and a 25% token burn. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) &#8211; Stake-to-Mine Crypto is Offering Huge Staking APYs and Cloud Mining Credits, New Presale is Selling Out </strong></h3>
<p>One of the best crypto launches in recent times is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a>, a stake-to-mine cryptocurrency platform. A revolutionary cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Minetrix will tokenize cloud mining. </p>
<p>More than $4.5 million has been raised in the presale at the time of writing, with 130% staking APY on offer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="443" class="size-full wp-image-125758 aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Presale Page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-768x378.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919127-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-52-45-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Cloud Mining is mostly offered by third-party corporations &#8211; allowing individuals to access rented mining power. However, these corporations have often scammed investors and stolen funds. Therefore, Bitcoin Minetrix will record all activities between themselves and investors on the blockchain. </p>
<p>For instance, Bitcoin Minetrix will offer cloud mining credits &#8211; which are ERC-20 tokens. These will be recorded on a digital ledger since they are earned by staking $BTCMTX, the native cryptocurrency. Tokens will be staked on an Ethereum-powered staking contract on Bitcoin Minetrix. </p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The earned cloud mining credits can be burned to earn Bitcoin mining power. The mining power is used to get allocated mining times and earn a portion of mining revenues. Therefore, this new cryptocurrency will revolutionize the cloud mining space by offering more transparency and security. </p>
<p>Interested investors can buy $BTCMTX tokens during round one of a ten-stage presale. There is a total supply of 4 billion tokens &#8211; 2.8 billion of which are being allocated on the presale. Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0119. This will rise to $0.0148 in the final stage, stage 39. <!-- notionvc: 22c6c24a-f1f4-4da4-a81d-b9c2119a4630 --></p>

<h3><strong>7. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; New Crypto Launch Aiming To Reduce Carbon Emissions With EVs, Offers APY on Staking $TUK</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/"><u>eTukTuk</u></a> (TUK) is a new crypto launch on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain that aims to tackle global challenges like climate change and economic inequality. It&#8217;s mainly focusing on sustainable transport in developing countries.</p>
<p>The platform’s main goal is to transition existing TukTuk fleets powered by Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) to electric vehicles (EVs), significantly cutting carbon emissions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315137/etuktuk-home.jpg" alt="eTukTuk EV crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Plus, eTukTuk is establishing a network of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and solar charging stations with local partners, readying for a broader EV rollout.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://tuktoken.io/white-paper.pdf?"><u>eTukTuk whitepaper</u></a>, the platform&#8217;s token, $TUK, has various uses. Primarily, it will be utilized for transactions at EV charging points. </p>
<p>As these stations become more popular, part of the revenue will be shared with local collaborators who maintain and power the stations. Also, $TUK token owners can stake the tokens to earn an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) that grows with the rise in transactions and EVSEs.</p>
<p>With the support of The Capital Maharaja Group, the project aims to encourage local production to reduce costs and make EVs affordable for TukTuk drivers. This change could quadruple driver earnings due to lower operating and maintenance costs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/315136/etuktuk-staking.jpg" alt="eTukTuk staking and territory partner program" /></figure>
<p>Beyond green transportation, eTukTuk uses blockchain to boost economic inclusion, lower transaction fees, and offer digital identities, extending financial access to underserved communities. </p>
<p>The presale has now raised more than $275k and offers 750% staking APY &#8211; to stay updated on eTukTuk&#8217;s progress, consider joining the token whitelist and following the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>eTukTuk Telegram channel</u></a>.</p>

So far, the campaign has planted 1,200 trees to save the Brazilian rainforest, donated $15,000 to save elephants, and also planted 20,000 trees in Guatemala.</p>
<p>Plus, it has already attained a <a href="https://github.com/coinscope-co/kyc/blob/main/chmpz/kyc.png"><u>KYC certificate by coinscope</u></a> as well as a <a href="https://solidity.finance/audits/ChimpzeeCoin/"><u>third party smarty contract audit</u></a>, compelling evidence of its transparency and commitment to excellence. </p>

<p>For these reasons, and more, Chimpzee has raised an impressive $2.3 million during its presale. Other positive elements of this environmental initiative include its novel earning mechanisms, including shop to earn (Chimpzee Shop), trade to earn (NFT Marketplace), and play to earn (Zero Tolerance Game).</p>
<p>The Chimpzee NFT passports provide the most direct means of earning the most income, receiving the biggest rewards, and acquiring the most privileges in the Chimpzee network.</p>
<p>There are a total of 4 NFT Passports &#8211; Diamond, Gold, Silver and Bronze. Those that do not own a passport will earn less income, receive less rewards and have less benefits</p>
<p>If you want to become part of the budding Chimpzee army, it&#8217;s easy to take part in the presale. The current price per token is a mere $0.00095 while the listing price is set at $0.00185. Trust Wallet or MetaMask can be used to facilitate the transaction, using ETH, USDT, or card. </p>

<p>At the center of the ecosystem is the CogwiseAI Core &#8211; which will feature a conversational AI-powered assistant that can help you with smart contract generation, market analysis, and guidance. Members can also access trading strategies through the AI &#8211; which automatically reads charting patterns and conducts technical analysis on different assets. </p>
<p>All these features can be accessed by staking a minimum of 10,000 $COGW tokens on the ecosystem. This new cryptocurrency also provides passive income to token holders. $COGW can be staked into liquidity pools, and are used to offer liquidity to other decentralized exchanges (DEXs). </p>
<p>As the tokens are used on the exchanges, token holders get a percentage of each swap. $COGW has a supply of 1 billion &#8211; 400 million of which have been allocated for the ongoing presale. Once the platform starts generating profits, 35% will be burned to reduce the supply. The remaining will be used for growth and sustainability.</p>

<p>The marketplace allows purchases only in $PIKA. 5% of all tokens spent on the marketplace are burned. Another 65% are given back to players through a play-to-earn prize pool, while the remaining tokens are used for marketing purposes. </p>
<p>Pikamoon also features an exploration side &#8211; where players can view the different regions, and capture new Pikamoon avatars along the way. Expanding your empire can be one way to stand a better chance of winning in the battles. </p>

<h3><strong>12</strong><strong>. Corite (CO) &#8211; Popular Interactive Music Crowdfunding Platform </strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain boasts various projects, and musicians can benefit from it as well. Corite is a platform launched for artists and their fans to interact while serving as a crowdfunding source.</p>
<p>Artists on Corite can invite fans to support their new projects by investing. It&#8217;s different from a donations platform because fans that support their artists receive a share of the streaming revenues. The artists decide the share of their royalties, and they keep all the rights.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88928/223444/cor.jpg" alt="Project Co music streaming initiative" /></figure>
<p>Corite provides daily data about how music is streamed globally and has also been instrumental in helping artists such as Alan Walker and Oscar Stembridge. Both artists gave back to their fans by using Corite.</p>
<p>At the core of this project is the native token CO. This utility token powers the entire ecosystem to enable transparent funding. Owning the coin enables investors to stake it, earn rewards for contributions and unlock functionality.  </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88928/223459/wsi-token.jpg" alt="WeSendIt token project" /></figure>

<p>The platform has enabled investors to stake their coins while they wait for them to be released, so they can earn rewards.</p>
<h3><strong>15. LasMeta (LASM) &#8211; New Play to Earn VR Poker Gaming Platform</strong> </h3>

<p>Investors can buy IPT tokens from the platform&#8217;s website. Each token costs $0.25, and 35 million coins are available. Interest Protocol aims to raise $8.75 million to make its platform even more scalable.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Find New Crypto Launches</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors wanting the best possible crypto prices should get involved in projects in their infancy. That means investing in projects when they’re in presales or during the ICO. Below are some resources for finding such avenues.</p>
<h3><strong>ICO Calendar</strong></h3>
<p>The most popular ICO calendar is provided by CoinMarketCap. The convenient aspect of using this source for new coin launches that it shows <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-upcoming-icos.htm">upcoming ICOs</a> and ongoing projects. Having access to the upcoming ICO information enables investors to gauge projects potentially in the presale stages.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88928/223665/coinm.jpg" alt="CoinMarketCap ICO calendar" /></figure>
<p>CoinMarketCap’s calendar also provides information about projects that recently concluded their ICO. Those platforms are also considered to be new crypto launches.</p>
<h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>
<p>Networking is a powerful tool for attaining wealth. The best way to network with like-minded individuals is by attending crypto events. The key speakers usually have an inside scoop about upcoming projects.</p>
<p>Even if the speakers don’t mention <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">new cryptocurrencies</a> during the speech, investors can speak to them after the event. Meeting one of the attendees who know about new crypto launches is highly likely.</p>
<h3><strong>Exchanges</strong></h3>
<p>Exchanges advertise new coin listings well in advance to ensure sufficient liquidity the day the coin starts trading. A key advantage of buying new crypto when it launches on an exchange is the possibility of getting the lowest prices.</p>
<p>Then when the rest of the market enters, the demand should increase the coin’s value. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Decide Whether to Invest in a Crypto Launch</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors need to do their due diligence to ensure a project is worth investing in. The fewer risks that accompany a project, the more likely it is to be a sound investment. So, how do investors minimize risk?</p>
<p>Ensure that a cryptocurrency provides utility. Crypto coins need to solve a real-world problem, provide a service or enable investors to earn interest by owning them. </p>
<p>The meme coin era has passed and has proven that investors quickly get over the hype of celebrity endorsements. They require value from projects. The ideal investment would be a project that already has a prominent brand and is branching out into different blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>Investors should enquire about the project’s developers. Knowing the identities of the people running the project is key. It shows they aren’t trying to hide, and investors know who to hold accountable in case of nefarious activities.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>From the new crypto launches we reviewed, Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) is one of the top options to watch.</p>
<p>It offers many incentives for the cost-conscious investor, and its fate is tied to key market phenomena. Should these events occur, Bitcoin ETF Token could perform extremely well. </p>
<p>Currently in its early presale stage, the token price is heavily discounted and the APY yields remain very high at over 200% &#8211; more than $2 million has been raised in just three weeks.</p>

<h2><strong>Reviewing the Top P2E Games</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve identified free play to earn games, let&#8217;s find out more about them.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Meme Kombat &#8211; Overall Best P2E Game With 112% APY And Exciting Meme vs Meme Fighting</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat"><u>Meme Kombat ($MK)</u></a> is an inventive new presale that gathers the world’s most famous memes together in a battle royale style arena. </p>
<p>The memes face off against one another (Doge vs Floki, Shiba Inu vs Doge, Pepe vs Sponge, etc) and spectators can bet on the outcome in a variety of different betting formats.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88485/332611/screen-shot-2023-10-04-at.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" /></figure>
<p>While the majority of meme presales are based on a singular meme icon, Meme Kombat has done it differently, taking already established meme coins and putting them under a single architecture. In this way, it might benefit from the already-enormous online meme communities, such as from Doge or Shiba Inu.</p>
<p>The gameplay is also well constructed. The fights are selected using random order sequencing with various odds depending on the unique characteristics of the meme tokens. State-of-the-art battle depictions are generated using AI rendering and fight outcomes are processed on the blockchain.</p>
<p>There are three primary betting mechanisms &#8211; P v P, P v Game, and Direct. There is also a multitude of side betting options to make the battles more exciting. These side betting options will be increased with time, demanding on ecosystem development and user feedback.</p>

<p>For season one, there are eleven memes in total. These are &#8211; Pepe, Pepe 2, Shiba, Sponge, Doge, Floki, Baby Doge, Milady, Kishu, Mong, and Wojack. More memes and styles will also be added, in due course.</p>
<p>This P2E game provides a steady 112% APY along with price appreciation potential and live wagering on combat outcomes &#8211; three ROI verticals.</p>
<p>It’s also expected to be fun and engaging to play, which is the main point, where users can spectate as their favorite memes engage in combat. These users can even wager against one another in P v P mode.</p>
<figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&#8221;https://youtu.be/Pf5esWyKM5A?si=imDO209kTOdht9uD[/embed]
<p>Some analysts have pegged this P2E ecosystem as a 10x, or even a 100x campaign, though these are only estimates and the meme industry is notoriously volatile.</p>
<p>More info on this meme vs meme game can be found in the <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper/"><u>Whitepaper</u></a>, as well as the  social channels (<a href="https://t.me/MemeKombatToken"><u>Telegram</u></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2FMeme_Kombat"><u>Twitter</u></a>).</p>

<h3><strong>2. eTukTuk &#8211; Green Transportation Project Aiming For Financial Inclusion in SE Asia</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tuktuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> is a new solution aiming to assist the environment and provide a means of passive income for TukTuk drivers. </p>
<p>TukTuks are a means of transport common to Asian countries, and play a key role in terms of revenue for many citizens. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88485/331915/screen-shot-2023-09-28-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token presale page" /></figure>
<p>TukTuks are very damaging to the environment, however. They emit more CO2 than a car. eTukTuk replaces them with electric vehicles that are much more affordable for drivers to purchase, and far more efficient. Designated charging stations will be maintinained by territory partners, to power the vehicles. This will help to cut down on fuel costs, which helps the drivers to earn more of an income.</p>
<p>The project launches from Sri Lanka, a region known to fare very poorly in terms of CO2 omissions. Climate change is now a matter of national concern for the government, and it has caught the attention of government departments as well as high profile investment groups, including Capital Maharaja Group and Asian Token Fund.</p>
<p>Driver routes will be optimized by AI to find the most efficient path, which can help to conserve battery power. The driver will be able to take advantage of token staking as well as rewards from using the TUK token for in-app purchases. It means less expense for the driver in terms of purchasing the vehicle, maintaining the vehicle, and finding the best route.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88485/331916/screen-shot-2023-09-28-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token staking" /></figure>
<p>Ultimately, eTukTuk aims to remedy socio-economic barriers and assist the environment through a single solution of electric vehicles. The price per token is currently $0.024 and acceptable cryptocurrencies include BNB, ETH, and USDT. eTukTuk is a Binance Smart Chain implementation.</p>
<p>The campaign has gone through <a href="https://coinsult.net/projects/etuktuk/"><u>a smart contract audit,</u></a> with excellent results.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>Telegram</u></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TukToken"><u>Twitter</u></a> can be connected with, for alerts and updates.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Chimpzee (CHMPZ) &#8211; A Green Play to Earn Token Featuring a Unique Crypto Game</strong></h3>
<p>At the second spot, we have a newly arrived play-to-earn crypto that focuses on providing a green ecosystem to users. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/">Chimpzee</a> is a Web 3 project that allows users to earn passive income while protecting the environment. </p>
<p>And the way that this earning mechanic is implemented has three parts. The Shop, the NFT marketplace, and the Zero Tolerance Game.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88485/311892/chimpzee-play-2-earn-game.jpg" alt="Chimpzee crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Zero Tolerance Game is a unique game that the official whitepaper of this project describes as a set of tasks that must be completed to stop the mechanics of man from destroying the forest, This P2E game has gamified doing good for the environment and tied with the reward tokens &#8211; CHMPZ coins. </p>
<p>The other two earning mechanics that are also a part of this ecosystem are Trade to Earn and Shop to Earn. Shop to Earn tokens allows users to earn CHMPZ coins by buying Chimpzee gear and merch, and the Trade to Earn mechanic has been weaved into the NFT marketplace that gives a share of the trading profits to everyone on the platform. </p>
<p>There have only been a few cryptocurrency projects that have weaved green aspirations into a P2E mechanic, and Chimpzee is one of the first to have done it. While the nature of this P2E game will be unveiled as we learn more. For now, it might be one of the most unique P2E games of this year. </p>
<p>Chimpzee has organized a presale that has 4 stages. Those who participate in the first stage will get to buy CHMPZ tokens at the lowest price. They will also get a chance to buy a Chimpzee Diamond NFT. Check out the <a href="https://www.chimpzee.io/assets/chimpzeeWhitepaper.pdf">official whitepaper of this project</a> for further details.</p>

<h3>5. PawFury &#8211; P2E Meme Ecosystem Leverages AI And Blockchain to Fight Climate Change</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.pawfury.com/">PawFury ($PAW)</a> is a new P2E ecosystem designed to blend AI and climate events for life-like simulations. It utilizes machine learning tools such as IBM Watson and Microsoft Azure to offer dynamic challenges in a realistic setting for players. This makes the gameplay educational as well as unique. </p>
<p>This is an environment whereby player activity corresponds to real-life scenarios. Players can complete in-game quests that result in a reduction in carbon emission, meaning there is variety in terms of what area is assisted. The main theme is that there is an intertwining between virtual and real activity, making the game itself far more meaningful. </p>
<h3><img decoding="async" width="900" height="442" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-129895" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699634115-screen-shot-2023-11-10-at-14-08-51-1.png" alt="PawFury Presale Homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699634115-screen-shot-2023-11-10-at-14-08-51-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699634115-screen-shot-2023-11-10-at-14-08-51-1-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699634115-screen-shot-2023-11-10-at-14-08-51-1-768x377.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699634115-screen-shot-2023-11-10-at-14-08-51-1-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699634115-screen-shot-2023-11-10-at-14-08-51-1-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699634115-screen-shot-2023-11-10-at-14-08-51-1-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></h3>
<p>The platform features five major meme icons (Max, Boris, Maya, Yuki, and Spike), each with distinct characteristics. Max, for instance, is a confrontational Shiba Inu character who meets challenges head-on with his sword, while Maya is a medic with a compassionate heart. Memes have three primary attributes &#8211; power, heart, and speed.</p>
<p>PawFury aims to release monthly reports on carbon reductions. These reports will outline how much was donated to a specific cause and the total overall reduction, as well as other key metrics. Players earn carbon credits for their activity and have freedom in terms of what cause they contribute towards.</p>
<p>The game helps to make players aware of what carbon emissions are and how to track them and will serve to inspire developers to incorporate green initiatives into their code. AI is also utilized in this gaming ecosystem to set new benchmarks in terms of the tracking and reduction of carbon emissions.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Decentraland (MANA) &#8211; Top Real Estate Metaverse Game  </strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that Decentraland is one of the best P2E games just based on its popularity. But it&#8217;s earned that prestige because this Ethereum-based platform provides more than just entertainment. Major corporations such as Samsung and Atari have used Decentraland to advertise their brands.</p>
<p>Decentraland is the first virtual world owned by its users, enabling them to create, explore and buy LAND, a plot in the Metaverse. Players can explore LANDs to experience majestic scenery such as medieval dungeon mazes and villages.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88485/222350/decen.jpg" alt="Decentraland crypto project" /></figure>
<p>This <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-metaverse-games-play-2022.htm">Metaverse game</a> enables players to buy LAND, which players can embellish by adding NFT assets to increase the value. LAND owners can rent their virtual lands to tenants to earn the native token, MANA.</p>
<p>Alternatively, players can also sell their lands after adding infrastructure to earn a profit. Samsung bought LAND on Decentraland and used it to open its first virtual store. Players can open a casino and earn rewards from participants in blackjack, poker or roulette games.</p>
<p>The other way to earn from Decentraland is by MANA&#8217;s capital appreciation. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88485/222393/sand-x.jpg" alt="Decentraland NFTs" /></figure>
<p>The Sandbox enables SAND token holders to use them for trading, governance, mortgages and earnings. This NFT crypto game has partnered with big names such as Snoop Dogg and Adidas, both of which own LAND in the Sandbox.</p>
<p>Investors also stand a chance of earning rewards if $SAND&#8217;s value appreciates. Considering The Sandbox&#8217;s userbase is expanding since its available on PC, mobile app, Mac and iPad, its native coin may see favorable price action in the future.</p>

<p>The blockchain contains a consensus mechanism to ensure crypto payments aren&#8217;t duplicated. The two major consensus methods are known as &#8216;proof of work&#8217; (PoW) and &#8216;proof of stake&#8217; (PoS). Bitcoin and the best proof of work coins use the original consensus mechanism &#8211; we&#8217;ve reviewed them and highlighted their benefits below.</p>
<p>This guide also details what proof of work is, how it differs from proof of stake and why PoW coins may be a good investment.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) &#8211; Best Alternative To PoW Coin With High APY, Dynamic Token Burns, And A Deflationary Mechanism<br /></strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is currently the top alternative to PoW coins connected to the much-anticipated Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). </p>
<p>$BTCETF, an ERC-20 token, leverages this anticipation, although it&#8217;s not directly linked to any Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>
<p>In its presale phase, $BTCETF offers a tiered pricing structure across ten stages. The current $0.0052 per token price will increase to $0.0068 by the final stage. </p>
<p>The presale has attracted high investor interest, with over $560K raised in just over a week of launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF whitepaper</a>, the maximum supply of $BTCETF is restricted to 2.1 billion tokens. Using a deflationary strategy, the project plans to reduce this supply by 25% through five token-burning events.</p>
<p>These events are aligned with significant milestones in the Bitcoin ETF space, including the approval and launch of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF, $BTCETF achieving $100 million in trading volume, the ETF crossing $1 billion in assets under management, and Bitcoin&#8217;s price exceeding $100K.</p>
<p>Additionally, a 5% trading tax is implemented on $BTCETF transactions, which is set to decrease by 1% with each milestone reached, further promoting long-term holding and value retention.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Bitcoin ETF Token is its staking mechanism, offering one of the highest Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) in the market.</p>
<p>Early stakers can get APYs exceeding over 400%, a rate expected to decrease as more tokens are staked. </p>
<p>This staking opportunity and 25% of the token supply dedicated to staking rewards provide an attractive prospect for investors looking to earn passive income.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Over 64 million tokens have been staked on the platform at press time, highlighting the increasing investor confidence.</p>
<p>Investors interested in $BTCETF can purchase the token using Ethereum wallets like MetaMask, with various cryptos accepted for payment. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) &#8211; Stake-to-Mine Crypto Offering Bitcoin Cloud Mining Power, Presale is Soaring</strong></h3>
<p>We recommend <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX) as the next best alternative to proof of work coins. The aim of Bitcoin Minetrix is to make cloud mining a cheaper and more transparent process for everyday people. </p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix will introduce a unique stake-to-mine mechanism through which $BTCMTX token holders can stake their holdings and earn tokenized cloud mining credits. Mining Bitcoin directly requires high investments in advanced equipment and hardware. Therefore, Bitcoin Minetrix will let users access rented equipment from third parties. </p>
<p>By staking the tokens on an Ethereum-powered smart contract, investors can generate cloud mining credits. These credits can be burned on the ecosystem to earn Bitcoin cloud mining power. This is used to get allocated mining times through which one can earn a portion of the mining revenues. </p>
<p>Thus, the entry barrier is reduced, and investors have complete control over their holdings. From a maximum supply of 4 billion, 2.8 billion $BTCMTX tokens have been allocated for the ongoing presale. The presale will consist of 39 rounds. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/333343/bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics.jpg" alt="BTCMTX tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>In only two weeks, Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $3.1 million on presale. The platform aims to generate a hard cap of $33.46 million by the end of the presale. While $BTCMTX is currently priced at $0.0114 per token, the price will increase at each successive stage. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; PoW Alternative With Staking APY and Meme vs Meme Appeal, 10% Presale Price Increase Upcoming </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is an inventive presale that offers meme vs meme combat. It’s a PoS system built on Ethereum that features some of the world&#8217;s most successful meme coins, pitting them against one another in a battle arena. </p>
<p>This proof-of-work alternative has the benefit of staking rewards. It’s also more environmentally friendly in comparison to proof of work. Ethereum slashed its carbon footprint by 99% in its recent merge to proof of stake from proof of work.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" width="900" height="440" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125759" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43.png" alt="Meme Kombat Presale Homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698919131-screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-09-55-43-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></h3>
<p>Users can bet on the outcome of the fights for additional ROI. There are three primary betting mechanisms with Meme Kombat. These are Direct, P v P, and P v Game. Side bets are also an option, allowing for dynamic bets on specialized fight dynamics. After Season One concludes, more betting options and meme icons are likely to be included.</p>
<p>This PoW alternative has substantial appeal as a multi-meme framework. Icons like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba Inu will feature in Season One. This could draw attention from some of the enormous online meme communities. Some analysts have suggested that this could be a 10x coin.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meme Kombat New 100x Potential Meme Coin Crypto Presale LIVE - 112% Staking Rewards &#x1f680;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pf5esWyKM5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The price per token will increase from $0.1667 to $0.183, a 10% increase. This is an automatic 10% price rise, with more rises expected in the near future. A total of 60 million $MK tokens are available in the presale, which recently broke through the $1 million mark. The hard cap is $10 million.</p>
<p>To invest in this PoW alternative, users will need to have a compatible Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Tamadoge (TAMA) &#8211; Proof Of Work Crypto Meme Coin with P2E Elements</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/tamadoge">Tamadoge</a> is a new meme coin offering high utility and rewards. This P2E game enables players to compete for crypto rewards by looking after virtual pets. Players who nurture their pets into adulthood the best climb the leaderboard to collect free crypto.</p>
<p>As well as rewarding players with TAMA tokens the Tamadoge platform has a multi-year roadmap to offer a better crypto gaming experience and more opportunities to earn. Two of the developments in 2023 are a Tamadoge P2E Arcade game, offering physical Tamadoge rewards and token prizes, and the augmented reality app — making player/pet interaction more realistic.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/223265/tamadoge-vault.jpg" alt="Tamadoge coin vault" /></figure>
<p>The other development is the token burn. TAMA tokens are already limited to a fixed maximum supply of 2 billion, and the game&#8217;s developers will burn 5% of all tokens received from transaction fees in the pet store purchases. </p>
<p>That will decrease the coin&#8217;s supply over time, and the increased exposure after its exchange listing on OKX will raise demand, making it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos to buy</a> and hold for the long term.</p>
<p>TAMA&#8217;s exchange listings have become convenient thanks to its ERC-20 token and proof of work mechanism that will be used for verifying its transactions once the presale ends. Tamadoge already had one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales</a> of 2022, selling $19 million of tokens in just eight weeks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220228/tama-p12.jpg" alt="Tamadoge ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>Investors can stay up to date with the coin&#8217;s latest developments by subscribing to the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram channel</a>. Bear in mind that the channel&#8217;s admins never DM subscribers first, so watch out for imposters.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Battle Infinity (IBAT) &#8211;  Popular Metaverse P2E Gaming Platform</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> has become one of the most popular P2E Metaverse games, enabling players to receive rewards from six platforms. Players can buy the native token, IBAT, on Battle Swap, a decentralized exchange on the platform, to build up teams and compete in the IBAT Premier League.</p>
<p>The game enables players to buy NFTs in Battle Marketplace to use as fashion accessories on their avatars. Players can also stylize their characters with unique hairstyles and use them to explore the Metaverse in Battle Arena while interacting with players in real time.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220233/ibat-pr1.jpg" alt="Battle Arena crypto project" /></figure>
<p>One of the ways players earn IBAT tokens is by monetizing their land. Another way is by staking their coins. Players can choose solo, duo and crates staking. Battle Infinity also rewards the most active players from the global staking pool, which receives half of the transaction fees on the platform.</p>
<p>IBAT&#8217;s presale was scheduled to last 90 days, but high demand for the coin resulted in it selling out within 25 days. During the presale, IBAT was available for $0.0015. The coin&#8217;s popularity was evident in the exchange listing, as IBAT&#8217;s price surged 700%, proving it&#8217;s one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest growing cryptocurrency to invest in</a>. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220238/ibat-coins.jpg" alt="IBAT crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>The game&#8217;s developers wanted to facilitate efficient and low-cost transactions, so they developed a BEP-20 token. Although Battle Infinity uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism, its platform offers investors several ways to earn rewards and potentially profit from price pumps when listed on new exchanges. </p>
<p>Investors can stay informed about Battle Infinity&#8217;s developments by joining the <a href="https://t.me/battleinfinity">Telegram channel.</a>    </p>

<h3><strong>6. Lucky Block (LBLOCK) &#8211; Top-Rated NFT Competition Platform</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most popular proof of work cryptos is LBLOCK. Initially, the project created a BEP-20 token enabling investors to earn rewards but also incur sales tax. <a href="https://luckyblock.com/">Lucky Block</a> developed LBLOCK V2, an ERC-20 token containing no sales tax and enabling centralized exchange listings.</p>
<p>Major exchanges LBank and MEXC have listed LBLOCK. The most recent listing was Gate.io on 1 September 2022. This coin&#8217;s history proved that its price pumps during new listings. Lucky Block CEO Scott Ryder announced that more exchanges will also list the coin.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220255/lucky-block-platform.jpg" alt="Lucky Block crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Another key announcement was the token burn. To make the coin more valuable, Ryder stated a 1% monthly token burn will commence on 30 September 2022. Lucky Block has partnered with exciting Web3.0 projects, which it will announce soon.</p>
<p>Besides the potential capital appreciation, Lucky Block enables investors to enter prize draws. Investors enter the draws by owning LBLOCK and accessing the Platinum Rollers Club NFT to stand a chance of winning a Lamborghini, $1 million in Bitcoin and a house worth $1 million. Transaction fees don&#8217;t apply to buying coins for draws.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220273/lblock-13.jpg" alt="Crypto coins and NFT coins" /></figure>
<p>Lucky Block started as a prize-giveaway platform offering exotic vacations and has progressed to an NFT competition platform giving away major prizes and offering two tokens, proving it&#8217;s one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long term crypto projects.</a></p>

<p>Litecoin is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, released in 2011 by its creator, Charlie Lee. The platform developed as a Bitcoin fork after Lee noticed that Bitcoin&#8217;s transactions were hefty and slow.</p>
<p>That resulted in the development of a Bitcoin alternative, an open source, global payment network that provides instant, near-zero cost payments globally. Litecoin&#8217;s network handles a higher transaction volume than Bitcoin because of more frequent block generation.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220285/1litecoin.jpg" alt="Litecoin to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Litecoin is software that enables users to run, modify, copy and distribute it. The platform&#8217;s use of proof of work means anyone with sufficient hardware can add blocks to its blockchain. Individuals verifying transactions are referred to as miners, who are rewarded 12.5 LTC per block.</p>
<p>Its halving occurs every 840,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years), resulting in the network producing 84 million LTCs. </p>
<p>Since the crypto community deems Litecoin as a Bitcoin alternative, it&#8217;s potentially one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins to buy.</a></p>

<h3><strong>8. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) &#8211;</strong><i> </i><strong>Efficient and Affordable Bitcoin Alternative Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin Cash is also a fork of Bitcoin and dubbed the Bitcoin &#8216;Peer to Peer Electronic Cash&#8217;. While Bitcoin is regarded as gold 2.0 and a store of value, Bitcoin Cash would be a credit card used for everyday transacting.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin fork increased the size of the blocks, enabling Bitcoin Cash to handle a larger volume of transactions and improve scalability. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220293/bch-1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Cash price chart" /></figure>
<p>Much like Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash was developed to offer faster and cheaper transactions. Its network operates without congestion, and transactions are confirmed within minutes. It costs mere pennies to send BCH globally and offers several levels of privacy.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash uses the proof of work algorithm to timestamp new blocks. The project used the same mining algorithm as Bitcoin, known as Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) — adjusting difficulty every 2016 blocks.</p>
<p>The platform has revised its EDA algorithm to make it more convenient for miners to earn BCH.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Ethereum Classic (ETC) &#8211; Ethereum Fork Running Smart Contracts and Apps </strong></h3>
<p>The hard fork of Ethereum&#8217;s network resulted in the separation of two blockchains and the formation of Ethereum Classic. ETC&#8217;s technology differs from Ethereum&#8217;s and is capable of running a wide variety of applications.</p>
<p>ETC powers transactions and smart contracts on its platform and is also rewarded to miners for solving proof of work puzzles by verifying transactions. Unlike Ethereum, Ethereum Classic is committed to using proof of work indefinitely.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220312/etc.jpg" alt="Ethereum Classic price chart" /></figure>
<p>The project insists that proof of work is the true consensus mechanism, providing censorship resistance. Ethereum Classic developers also believe that projects migrating to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-proof-of-stake-coins.htm">proof of stake</a> are financially motivated and don&#8217;t do it because of environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Ethereum Classic acknowledges that proof of work isn&#8217;t a perfect system and is subject to 51% attacks. But its chains have functioned resiliently for over 10 years and prioritize critical qualities providing blockchain utility.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Bitcoin (BTC) &#8211; Highest Market-Cap Crypto and Original Proof of Work Coin</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s epic rallies have made it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm">top trending cryptos.</a> It&#8217;s the first coin to take off in a bull run and pave the way for altcoins. BTC is the most popular crypto and has the largest market cap in the digital asset market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the first crypto developed to use the proof of work consensus mechanism. The effectiveness of Bitcoin&#8217;s use of proof work hasn&#8217;t deteriorated throughout the years, regardless of the BTC price. But it requires special hardware and relies on microprocessors. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220318/bitcoin-btc.jpg" alt="Bitcoin to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>By using proof of work since 2009, Bitcoin has provided a borderless, decentralized currency enabling peer-to-peer transactions at any time. </p>
<p>According to popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a>, BTC is expected to reach its ATH of $68k by 2025. </p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>11. Zcash (ZEC)</strong> <strong>&#8211; Cryptography Platform Providing Enhanced Privacy</strong></h3>
<p>Although blockchain provides a decentralized platform, most of its transactions are public. Since discretion is important to investors, privacy coins such as Zcash have become popular.</p>
<p>A key feature of Zcash is the privacy aspect, but it also provides fast transactions at low costs. The platform offers shielded transactions and keeps the user&#8217;s financial information confidential. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220325/zcash.jpg" alt="ZCash price chart" /></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s the first project to use zk-SNARKs, a form of zero-knowledge cryptography, providing the highest level of privacy. Although Zcash transactions are on the blockchain, it hides key personal information such as the user&#8217;s wallet address and the amount of funds transferred.</p>
<p>Zcash secures its network by using proof of work mining algorithm, then rewards miners for the computation of each block with Zcash tokens and fees for transactions added to the block.</p>

<h2><strong>What Defines Proof of Work Crypto?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrency projects can choose between proof of work and proof of stake consensus mechanisms. Every transaction on the blockchain needs to be verified to avoid duplication and to ensure legitimate transactions.</p>
<p>A consensus mechanism acts as a system that connects all networks to ensure transaction legitimacy. It could be referred to as the central authority for transaction verification and as means for different stakeholders to agree to a transaction.</p>
<p>Proof of work is the original crypto consensus mechanism and requires a tremendous amount of processing power. Bitcoin, the first crypto to use proof of work, has received significant criticism for using a lot of energy consumption for mining. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220363/bitcoin-g759dcf22c-1280.jpg" alt="Crypto miner" /></figure>
<p>Virtual miners secure and verify proof of work blockchains by solving a math equation and receive token rewards for successful completion.</p>
<h2><strong>The Difference Between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Proof of work blockchain is regarded as the true consensus mechanism maintaining a secure decentralized blockchain by converting electricity into security. Using proof of work is an energy-intensive exercise, and it can struggle to process a large number of transactions that busy networks generate.</p>
<p>It is prone to 51% of attacks on the blockchain. To provide blockchain users with a safer, more efficient alternative, proof of stake was developed. </p>
<p>Proof of stake doesn&#8217;t convert energy into security. Instead, it requires crypto holders to lock up their assets so that blocks can be added. In exchange for locking up their coins, stakers receive more tokens as rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87537/220375/bitcoin-gde5a9671d-1280.jpg" alt="Bitcoin blockchain network" /></figure>
<p>A key reason crypto projects use proof of stake instead of proof of work is environmentalism. Proof of stake has been marketed as a secure verification method without vast energy consumption. Excessive electricity use isn&#8217;t required, unlike proof of work.</p>
<p>One of the main differences between these two consensus mechanisms is penalties for network disruptions and bad actors. Miners using proof of work are penalized the sunk cost of energy and computing power for submitting incorrect information.</p>
<p>With proof of stake, validators have their funds reduced for accepting a bad block.</p>
<h2><strong>Are Proof of Work Cryptos a Worthwhile Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-volatile-cryptos.htm">most volatile cryptos</a> use proof of work as a consensus mechanism. Yet, proof of work cryptocurrencies provide investors several benefits.</p>
<h3><strong>Proven to Work</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is the first crypto that used proof of work for secure transaction verification and still does to this day. Proof of work has been around for more than 10 years and hosts the biggest crypto coins such as Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s been around since day one, proof of work is a more trusted mechanism than new methods claiming to be better alternatives. Its longevity has made it the perfect option for long term crypto projects.</p>
<h3><strong>Mining Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>Proof of work requires individuals to verify transactions. They are called miners, who use high-powered hardware and consume high levels of energy to solve a math puzzle. </p>
<p>Once they&#8217;ve solved it accurately and added a block, they receive rewards in the form of the network&#8217;s coin.</p>
<h3><strong>Decentralization</strong></h3>
<p>Miners are located globally and don&#8217;t require a third party such as an exchange to receive rewards.</p>
<p>Using proof of work, instead of proof of stake, enables the user to maintain more control of the processing on blockchain, and it cuts out the middle man.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Invest in Proof of Work Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors can use the step-by-step guide below to learn how to buy Bitcoin ETF Tokens right now. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Create a Crypto Wallet &#8211; </strong>Before it&#8217;s possible to participate in the Bitcoin ETF Tokens presale, a crypto wallet is required. While there are hundreds of options to choose from, in our experience, MetaMask is great for desktop users while Trust Wallet is commonly considered the superior choice for mobile investors. </li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Buy USDT or ETH &#8211; </strong>After setting up a crypto wallet, it&#8217;s time to fund it. Both USDT and ETH can be used to purchase BTCETF, meaning it&#8217;s up to the investor to decide which better suits them. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that ETH will always be needed for gas fees. </li>
<li><strong>Step 3: Purchase BTCETF &#8211; </strong>Lastly, head over to the Bitcoin ETF Token presale website and connect the newly created crypto wallet. Following that, use the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button to open the purchase menu, decide how many tokens to buy, and confirm the transaction. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our proof of work cryptocurrency list consists of nine of the best coins. While all the PoW cryptos can be a good investment opportunity, Bitcoin ETF Token is the best alternative with high staking APY of over 400% for early stakers. The platform raised over $560K in just over a week of launch, showing strong community trust.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Wall Street Memes (WSM) &#8211; Shitcoin Harnessing Meme Power and NFT Legacy, Now Live On Exchanges</strong></h3>
<p>Launching into the bustling shitcoin wave of 2023, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> launched its shitcoin, $WSM, via a presale on 26 May. As a renowned entity in the NFT space with a broad online footprint &#8211; gathering over a million followers across social media channels like Twitter and Instagram &#8211; this veteran project aims to extend its influence into the crypto arena, powered by its strong community.</p>
<p>The $WSM presale has already garnered massive hype and attention since launching, raising more than $25 million. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/319917/screen-shot-2023-07-25-at.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token presale" /></figure>
<p>While the inherent risks of early-stage projects should be considered, the past successes of community-driven platforms present a silver lining for potential investors of $WSM.</p>
<p>Grounded in internet meme culture, Wall Street Memes aims to secure a strong position for $WSM in the meme coin arena. Its commitment to staying up-to-date with emerging trends, including Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs, speaks volumes about the brand&#8217;s adaptability. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the brand&#8217;s initial <a href="https://thedalesreport.com/crypto-nfts/wall-street-bulls-nft-collection-sells-out-in-half-an-hour/"><u>Ethereum NFT collection, Wall Street Bulls, sold out in 30 minutes</u></a> back in 2021, underlining its potential.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wall Street Memes&#8217; online presence has caught the attention of influencers, including Elon Musk, who has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954"><u>interacted with their content</u></a> multiple times. The brand&#8217;s strong rapport with its community could pave the way for $WSM&#8217;s listing on major exchanges, possibly including platforms like Binance or Coinbase.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86701/277446/screenshot-2023-05-26-at-.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes WSM token" /></figure>
<p>In celebration of $WSM&#8217;s presale launch, the team has organized a $50,000 airdrop. For further details, you can visit the project’s <a href="https://linktr.ee/wallstmemes"><u>Linktree</u></a>.</p>
<p>With a total supply of 2 billion $WSM tokens, the brand is all set to distribute 50% during the presale, with the remainder divided between community rewards and exchange liquidity. </p>
<p>This community-centric approach, which notably has no team allocation seems to address past issues faced by some shitcoins, where many team-held tokens flooded the market.</p>
<p>You can join the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Wall Street Memes Telegram group</u></a> to stay informed about this presale. </p>

<h3><strong>3. eTukTuk &#8211; Top Shitcoin With 33,487% APY Targets Transport Industry &amp; Climate Change</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> is a shitcoin that provides 33,487% APY and its focus is the transport industry in Sri Lanka, and the surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It has multiple aims, including banking the unbanked, improving on CO2 emissions, increasing financial inclusion, and building a sharing economy. But its main focus is on transport and the environment.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/332173/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token presale" /></figure>
<p>Sri Lanka is known for high levels of environmental pollution. It has become an issue of national concern, as it affects the wellbeing of citizens along with its perceived status on an international level. eTukTuk has an innovative solution that helps increase revenue for TukTuk drivers while simultaneously improving the nation’s CO2 profile.</p>
<p>This is done through the introduction of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), which are electric and powered at specific charging stations, maintained by territory partners. This means that drivers will not have to pay for fuel anymore, which can take up a significant amount of their fare, which is not very high to begin with.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/332174/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token staking" /></figure>
<p>The vehicles are also cheaper to purchase and will last longer. They will be enhanced by AI which will select the best route and also help to locate issues and optimize the machine for longevity. The TUK token will even be used to support green research initiatives.</p>
<p>The TUK token is derived from the BNB chain, which can process thousands of transactions per second and is lower cost, and more eco-friendly, than other blockchains. But while the Binance Smart Chain forms the backbone of the project, it recognizes interoperability and further supports chains like Cardano, with more to follow in the near future.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/332175/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk charging network project" /></figure>
<p>The price per token is $0.024. But this price will increase with time, while the yields will fall. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Chimpzee &#8211; Earn Income, Save Animals, &amp; Fight Climate Change Through the Chimpzee Shitcoin</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/chimpzee/en"><u>Chimpzee (CHMPZ)</u></a> is not your typical shitcoin &#8211; it&#8217;s a no-nonsense project that is serious about tackling climate change. The campaign has already planted 1,200 trees to save the Brazilian rainforest, donated $15,000 to save elephants, and planted 20,000 trees in Guatemala. It is keen to empower people to act quickly and to raise awareness for an issue that needs immediate attention. </p>
<p>The whitepaper outlines the damage being caused to rainforests as well as endangered species such as Elephants and Rhinos. A tree can be planted for as little as a $1 donation &#8211; yet the world loses 6 million hectares of forest each year due to deforestation, a size equivalent to Portugal. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/326734/screen-shot-2023-08-28-at.jpg" alt="Chimpzee token presale" /></figure>
<p>There is a total supply of 100 billion CHMPZ tokens, which is set to be reduced to 60 billion. Of the total supply, 10% of the proceeds are given to charities concerned with the environment and climate change.</p>
<p>Of the remaining, 10% is allocated to exchange liquidity, 45% to the presale, 15% to marketing, 5% to community rewards, 10% to development, and 5% to the team. </p>
<p>Those that purchase during the presale can benefit from a 50% additional bonus, so it’s definitely an advantage to get in early. The presale price is $0.00095 while the listing price is set at $0.00185.</p>
<p>Investors can help the environment through Chimpzee while earning rewards from passive income. To take part in the presale, a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet) is required, along with ETH, USDT, or a credit card.  </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/326735/screen-shot-2023-08-28-at.jpg" alt="Chimpzee crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The Chimpzee project is also audited and has a KYC certification. It further boasts an Ambassador &amp; Community Outreach Program to safeguard the well-being of animals and the environment. It’s going all out to help the environment and wants to act quickly to save endangered species and protect the rainforest. </p>

<p>$SCORP, the native crypto of <a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a>, is not exactly a shitcoin.

It has high relevance in the fast-growing online gambling and betting market.</p>
<p>The $SCORP token presale has now raised more than $850k.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/276978/scorpion-green-bg.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino token presale" /></figure>

<h3><strong>6. Mooky &#8211; New Charity Token Available to Buy on Presale </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mooky/">Mooky</a> is a shitcoin that aims to contribute to the environment by leveraging blockchain technology. $MOOK, the native token, is used to generate revenue, grow a community-driven ecosystem and contribute to various green charities. </p>
<p>Already in stage 8 of its presale, Mooky has raised more than $900k in its presale.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87899/274660/mooky-img.jpg" alt="Mooky crypto project" /></figure>
<p>From a total token supply of 500 billion, 3% of $MOOK is used as a visible charity wallet. 70% is also allocated for the ongoing presale. Currently, one can purchase the token for $0.00000735 &#8211; the presale will consist of 12 rounds, and the price will rise to $0.00003125 by the final phase. </p>
<p>$MOOK tokens can be used to purchase NFTs on the ecosystem. Users will be able to mint 1,000 NFTs, each of which represents a real-life planted tree. Those holding the most valuable NFTs can access Mooky’s DAO, ‘Ventures Club.’ </p>

<h3><strong>7. Sensei Inu &#8211; Shiba Inspired Shitcoin With Proof Of Value Consensus Mechanism And DAO Governance</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/senseiinu/"><u>Sensei Inu ($SINU)</u></a> is a MemeFi project that introduces a new proof of value consensus mechanism as opposed to proof of stake. In this way, participants are rewarded depending on what they contribute and learn as opposed to merely staking their coins.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/334441/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei Inu token presale" /></figure>
<p>This is a knowledge focused trivia platform with 10 questions in each round, which get more difficult as time goes by. The winners take the most rewards and it is possible to compete in multiple rounds each month. The questions are mainly Web3 related. An easy dashboard with visual graphics is provided to have an overview of progress and rewards.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://media.senseiinu.com/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Sensei Inu Whitepaper</u></a>, the purpose is to remedy financial inequality by providing a skills based reward system. So there is no favoritism for those who have the funds to invest in large amounts of coins, as earnings are a function of knowledge and activity. </p>
<p>It is, however, preferable to invest earlier as opposed to later. The current price per $SINU is  $0.0007, which will rise to $0.0008 in the next stage of the presale. The presale also features an airdrop of 50 million tokens and a DAO governance model for equitable decision making.</p>
<p>This is also a relatively safe and transparent project &#8211; no high or medium severity issues were found in the <a href="https://media.senseiinu.com/Sensei%20Inu(techrate%20Audit).pdf"><u>smart contact audit.</u></a></p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/334442/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="Sensei Inu proof-of-value" /></figure>
<p>There is a total of 5 billion tokens. 50% is allocated to the presale, 20% to liquidity, 20% to burning, and 10% to CEX and team. The token burning process helps to take tokens out of circulation, which can serve to increase the price.</p>
<p>ETH, USDT, BNB, or Card are acceptable means of payment in exchange for $SINU, through a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Doge Uprising &#8211; Doge Inspired Shitcoin Trades at a 50% Discount and Pits Elon Musk vs Mark Zuckerberg. </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising/"><u>Doge Uprising ($DUP)</u></a> is a Doge-themed shitcoin with a very interesting backstory that is different from the typical degen token. One thing that sets it apart is that it does not run upon a central meme icon. </p>

<p>It runs on a compelling story. In the year 2045, Mark Zuckerberg (the “Lizard Boy”) has exercised complete control over the planet. Only Doge Mecha NFTs, led by none other than Elon Musk and some courageous crypto investors, can save the day from tyranny. Ownership of a robotized and weaponized Doge Mecha NFT is a sign of resistance against Orweillian control, and offers more than just price appreciation potential. </p>
<p>So owners are joining a movement, though they can also benefit from multiple ROI mechanisms. The major ROI mechanisms are the NFTs, token price appreciation, and staking APY. The shitcoin currently trades at $0.000013, which will double to $0.000026 in the next stage of the presale.</p>
<p>There are a total of 450 billion $DUP tokens, with 270 billion (60%) available in the presale. Of the remainder, 20% goes to exchanges, 10% goes to airdrops, 5% is allocated to development, and 5% is allocated to marketing. The token will launch on Uniswap after the presale is compete. </p>

<p>In terms of project transparency, Doge Uprising scored well in the <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/SolidProof-Audit.pdf">smart contract audit</a> conducted by a reputable third party (SolidProof). This shitcoin also provides a 10% referral campaign, paid automatically to the referrer’s wallet.</p>
<p>To take part in this presale, a compatible Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Wallet Connect) is required, along with ETH, USDT, or BNB.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Dogecoin (DOGE)</strong> <strong>&#8211; Globally Recognized Meme Coin</strong></h3>
<p>One of the top shitcoins that has provided investors with huge returns is Dogecoin &#8211; the development of DOGE started out as a joke, but the coin&#8217;s massive price spike has made many investors take it seriously.</p>
<p>DOGE wasn&#8217;t on many investors&#8217; radar until the 2021 crypto rally, when it provided more than 10,000% returns for investors who bought the coin at the beginning of 2021, thanks to Elon Musk&#8217;s continued social media endorsements. As a result, many crypto enthusiasts have been asking <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-dogecoin.htm">is it too late to buy Dogecoin today?</a></p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/311683/kanchanara-zblzjbnja8k-un.jpg" alt="Dogecoin crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>However, since its May 2021 all-time high of $0.71, Dogecoin has lost just over 90% of its value &#8211; despite that, many investors believe it remains one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins</a> to invest in.</p>
<p>Adoption has been one of the factors rallying the support of the DOGE community, with electric car maker Tesla accepting payments in Dogecoin. Other big corporations accepting the coin as payment are AMC Theatres, GameStop, Twitch and Newegg.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of investing in Dogecoin over Bitcoin is that it&#8217;s more efficient. Dogecoin&#8217;s mining is faster and uses less energy. </p>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong>Buy Dogecoin on eToro</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>10. Shiba Inu (SHIB)</strong> <strong>&#8211; Popular Meme Coin Aspiring to be Dogecoin Alternative</strong></h3>
<p>Hot on the heels of Dogecoin&#8217;s hype as the ultimate meme coin was Shiba Inu. This meme project used an extremely effective marketing strategy to position itself as the next best thing to Dogecoin. </p>
<p>Shiba Inu used social media and influencers &#8211; as well as its message as a &#8216;DOGE Killer&#8217; &#8211; to get the word to the masses about its intention of replacing Dogecoin.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/311684/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu coins" /></figure>
<p>Many investors linked Shiba Inu&#8217;s logo of the dog to Dogecoin, believing that the two projects were intertwined. It was pure investor speculation that resulted in a SHIB price rally of more than 1,000% during October 2021. After the hype was over, Shiba Inu&#8217;s price crashed by more than 90%, but it has slightly recovered. </p>
<p>But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-shiba-inu-a-good-investment.htm">is Shiba Inu a good investment</a> in 2023? This project is trying to distance itself from its meme coin label and is striving to convince investors it offers utility by evolving into a vibrant ecosystem. Shiba Inu will have to work hard to convince the market of its value, as its price crash is the consequence of many investors believing it has no utility.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>11. ApeCoin (APE) &#8211; Top NFT Crypto Supporting the Gaming Evolution</strong></h3>
<p>The NFT market has taken off in the last 18 months and at the center of the movement is an NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). The celebrity endorsement of this project has resulted in certain BAYC <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm">NFTs</a> selling for millions of dollars.</p>
<p>ApeCoin is the native token of the Bored Ape and Mutant Ape ecosystem. To enter BAYC and take full advantage of it, investors need to own APE. This crypto project&#8217;s developers were adamant about providing utility for the coin by ensuring it&#8217;s an ERC20 token to serve as a protocol layer for community-led initiatives driving culture into the Metaverse.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/311686/apecoin.jpg" alt="ApeCoin logo" /></figure>
<p>APE is specially designed for the Web3.0 ecosystem and plays a key role in the Ape Foundation, which strives for the growth and development of the APE ecosystem. </p>
<p>The APE DAO is vital for managing and building a globally dispersed community. ApeCoin&#8217;s platform seeks to be at the forefront of the gaming evolution and use Web3 to build a culture that expresses itself through art and events.</p>

<h2><strong>What Defines a Shitcoin?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Most shitcoins don&#8217;t offer any utility, meaning they don&#8217;t solve a real-world problem and only exist to be speculated on and grow in value. They exist on the blockchain and the term is often used as another name for a meme coin, which gain traction because of hype &#8211; often manifested by celebrities.</p>
<p>Shitcoins usually tend to have a low market cap and a high circulating supply. Exceptions to this rule exist and some coins are deflationary, meaning their supply decreases through token burns. </p>
<h2><strong>Is a Shitcoin Investment Valuable? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors should determine if their investing goals align with a shitcoin&#8217;s offering. If it does, then a shitcoin investment might provide some value. The best we can do is mention several elements that are in a shitcoin&#8217;s favor.</p>
<p>Some shitcoins have proven to be extremely popular, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the past and Pepe and Sponge amid the 2023 meme coin frenzy.</p>
<p>However, because of their lack of long-term value, they are susceptible to pump-and-dumps &#8211; where price rockets over a short period and then dies away &#8211; and can struggle to return to their former highs.</p>
<p>Therefore, extra caution should be taken when investing in shitcoins, as well as deciding when to take profits.</p>
<h3><strong>Community Support</strong></h3>
<p>A key reason that coins such as DOGE and SHIB had such massive rallies was massive community support and then mainstream recognition.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86960/219066/doge-gf81585024-1280.jpg" alt="Dogecoin and Shiba Inu coins" /></figure>
<p>The communities made a big fuss over their coins and purported them to be the next big thing, attracting other investors. </p>
<p>The hype around these coins ended up being a self-fulfilling prophecy since Dogecoin and Shiba Inu provided investors with massive returns.</p>
<p>Major media outlets began to cover them which led to yet more investment and speculation.</p>
<h3><strong>Celebrity Endorsements</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not only the shitcoin token holders who lured investors in, as celebrities played a major role. They used the power of social media to advertise projects to their massive audiences. </p>
<p>No doubt some of them were financially incentivized to promote a project, but it worked.</p>
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s support of Dogecoin is a clear example, with numerous Tweets in 2020 and 2021 helping to increase the price alongside announcements that his companies would support DOGE as a currency.</p>
<p>The build-up to his appearance on Saturday Night Live saw the price skyrocket, before a rapid sale once he was actually on the show.</p>
<p>After months of negative price action, news that Musk would purchase Twitter &#8211; and speculation that he would add DOGE as a payment method on the social media platform &#8211; saw the price increase again.</p>
<p>An April Fool&#8217;s Day gag in 2023, where Musk briefly changed the Twitter logo to a shiba inu dog, sparked another price pump.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our detailed reviews include where to buy shitcoins and shitcoin prices for certain assets. After comparing all of the assets, we found that Meme Kombat to be the best shitcoin. </p>
<p>It combines a variety of the worlds most popular shitcoins/meme tokens (Doge, Shiba Inu, Floki) and allows them to battle it out, with multiple betting options on the outcome.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrific concept that the market might take well to, having the appeal of not just one, but many popular tokens. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s find out more about what made each asset some of the most searched cryptocurrencies. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Overall Most Searched Crypto With A High-Yield, Deflationary Mechanism And Dynamic Token Burns<br /></strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is the most searched crypto, especially due to its link with the potential approval and launch of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>It is set to capitalize on significant milestones in the Bitcoin ETF space, offering a unique combination of high staking yields and a deflationary model.</p>
<p>The $BTCETF is currently in a structured presale phase divided into ten stages, each releasing 84 million tokens. The current token price is at $0.0052, which will rise to $0.0068 by the final stage, resulting in an immediate gain for early investors.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token’s presale has already seen an explosive start, with over $560K raised in just over a week after the official launch, showing the community&#8217;s support and trust in this project.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>A total of 2.1 billion $BTCETF tokens are in supply, with a deflationary mechanism at the core of its strategy. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF whitepaper</a>, the project plans to burn 25% of its total supply through 5 key milestone events, each reducing the total token count by 5%. </p>
<p>These milestones are directly linked to significant developments in the Bitcoin ETF space and the token’s market performance, such as $BTCETF surpassing $100 million in trading volume, the confirmation and release of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF, the ETF&#8217;s assets under management crossing $1 billion, and Bitcoin&#8217;s value exceeding $100K.</p>
<p>A 5% trading tax is currently levied, set to decrease by 1% upon reaching each milestone.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, investors can earn APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) over 500%, with this rate designed to decrease as more tokens are staked.</p>
<p>This incentivizes early participation and staking, allowing investors to maximize their returns. Over 56 million tokens have already been staked, showing the community&#8217;s early engagement and trust in the project.</p>
<p>Interested users can join the <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Bitcoin ETF Telegram channel</a> to follow the project&#8217;s progress. Additionally, following $BTCETF on social platforms like <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token">X (Twitter)</a> provides real-time updates and community discussions.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; World’s First BTC Stake To Mine With 215% APY and $10 Upfront Investment</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</a> is the next highly searched crypto at the present time with the world’s first stake-to-mine model. It targets the gigantic Bitcoin mining industry with a new methodology. </p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is cost-prohibitive for the average investor and requires specialized knowledge. The industry is dominated by huge mining companies with massive financial resources. So it’s not possible for regular investors to compete. Even the cloud mining industry is filled with scam providers and high upfront costs. </p>

<p>This is where Bitcoin Minetrix can demonstrate its value. The Ethereum project offers the world’s first stake-to-mine. The way this works is that $BTCMTX tokens are staked in return for cloud mining credits. The mining credits are burned in return for BTC. The more mining credits burned, the more BTC generated for miners. </p>
<p>All of this is conducted through a single dashboard where the miners can choose to burn, stake, or withdraw their tokens. It means that the miner now has complete control, with an investment of just $10, the minimum price entry. The presale is also running a $30,000 airdrop, set with 10 distinct drops of $3,000 each. </p>

<p>At the present time, the APY for this project is 215%. Over 195 million $BTCMTX tokens have been staked so far, with rewards of 158.5 $BTCMTX per ETH block. There are 39 stages to this presale with incremental price increases at each progressive stage. The current price per token is $0.0113. By the final stage, this will have increased to $0.0148. </p>
<p>This could be a 10x coin in 2023, as it has extreme market potential. $2.7 million has been raised in the presale so far and the target hard cap is $32 million, which is a significant amount. This is a presale with serious intent to redefine the BTC cloud mining industry with a new model that allows users complete control with a small upfront investment. </p>

<h3>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Frequently Searched Crypto Presale With Multi-Meme Appeal Raises Over $850K</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is a highly sought-after ERC20 crypto, for reasons that are self-evident. Meme coins are known to be very popular and highly searched in general. Campaigns such as Doge and Shiba Inu can have online followings that number in the millions.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat takes these successful meme campaigns and they face each other in battle. It offers a combination of special events and regular fights. Season One offers 11 of the world’s most iconic meme figures, including Pepe, Doge, Shiba Inu, and more.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" width="900" height="436" class="alignnone wp-image-122512 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40.png" alt="Meme Kombat crypto project" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-300x145.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-768x372.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698659961-screen-shot-2023-10-30-at-09-01-40-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> </h3>
<p>So you might see a fight between  Pepe and Floki or Shiba Inu and Wojack. Fights are selected at random and there are multiple betting options to add to the appeal.</p>
<p>Users can view upcoming fights and see whether they would like to place a wager, given the odds at hand. It’s also possible to split the portfolio between staking and wagering, to effectively manage bankroll. </p>
<p>Users can place wagers on who is going to win the fight, as well as benefit from APY. So there are financial incentives tied in with meme appeal, which could easily be a winning combination moving forward.</p>
<p>Fights outcomes are processed on the blockchain for enhanced transparency and AI-rendered graphics help to display appealing images. The quality of images is key to a successful meme campaign.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes (WSM) &#8211; Highly Searched Crypto With A Community-Centric Presale That Raised $25M+ In Presale, now Live on OKX</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> (WSM) is one of the most searched crypto, offering high staking rewards while building a strong community base. The community support is reflected in the $25 million raised by the platform in its now-complete presale. </p>
<p>Created by the founders of Wall St Bulls, the well-known Ethereum NFT project, WSM, has caught the attention of both investors and notable figures like Elon Musk on Twitter.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on its creators&#8217; previous success, an NFT launch that sold out in 30 minutes, Wall St. Bulls also ventured into the Bitcoin NFT sector to stay ahead of market trends.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90529/329656/screenshot-2023-09-12-at-.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token presale page" /></figure>
<p>Wall Street Memes has drawn massive interest by offering passive income via a staking program. </p>
<p>Token holders can stake their $WSM to earn an impressive APY of over 60%, with the current rewards at 75 $WSM per block. The community&#8217;s trust is evident, with over 320 million tokens already staked. </p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes whitepaper</u></a>, the project strategically allocates its total supply of 2 billion tokens to drive community involvement.</p>
<p>30% is set aside for community rewards, further improving its appeal. Notably, the absence of token allocation to the team reduces market flooding risks or ‘rug pull’ risks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90529/329657/screenshot-2023-09-12-at-.jpg" alt="Wall Street Meme token staking" /></figure>
<p>The platform also plans for a $50k airdrop for active social media followers, highlighting its commitment to giving back to the community. </p>
<p>Wall Street Memes was one of the most successful presales of 2023, with a $25 million raise and interaction from Elon Musk. It is now listed on OKX and other T1 exchanges. The campaign also launched its own crypto casino recently, with $WSM as the native coin. </p>

<h3><strong>5. Tamadoge (TAMA) &#8211; Frequently Searched Crypto and Utility Token</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge</a> Tamadoge has proved its popularity since the beginning of its presale becoming one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers.htm">top crypto gainers</a> of 2022.</p>
<p>Tamadoge has been featured in major financial publications such as Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, Market Watch, The Economic Times and Coincierge, to name a few.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/220666/tama-a.jpg" alt="Tamadoge media mentions" /></figure>
<p>Another key reason for the coin&#8217;s growing popularity is its token burn. The developers of this NFT game will burn 5% of all tokens spent on transaction fees in the pet store. That will significantly reduce Tamadoge&#8217;s 2 billion coin supply.</p>
<p>The best part about Tamadoge is that it enables players to earn TAMA tokens while caring for their digital pets. Players can exercise, feed and breed pets to adulthood and climb the leaderboard as their pets grow into adults. Once adults, the pets compete against other pets in the battle arena.</p>
<p>Investors wanting to know more about the most searched cryptocurrency in 2023 can subscribe to the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram channel</a> (Admins never DM subscribers first. Be careful of imposters).</p>

<h3><strong>6. Lucky Block (LBLOCK) &#8211; Casino Gaming Platform Gaining Traction</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://luckyblock.com/">Lucky Block</a> Players who enjoy a diverse selection of games will find Lucky Block a great choice, especially now that its Casino and Sportsbook have been launched.</p>
<p>The platform is known for being one of the best crypto and bitcoin casinos available, with over 2,700 games from well-known providers like Hacksaw Gaming, Microgaming, and Asia Gaming. There&#8217;s a wide range of games to choose from, offering players different difficulty levels and rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/252873/lblock-games-2-900x349.jpg" alt="Lucky Block casino games" /></figure>
<p>Lucky Block initially developed a BEP-20 token, which included a 12% sales tax. The project wanted to spare investors sales tax, so it developed an ERC-20 token, known as LBLOCK V2. The V2 token excluded transaction tax and fees, but it also paved the way for major exchange listings.</p>
<p>LBLOCK became one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-trending-cryptos.htm">top trending cryptos</a> when it was listed on LBank and MEXC. The word about Lucky Block spread even further when the project announced a partnership with professional boxing champion Dillian Whyte. Another champion to join the Lucky Block roster was Florian Marku.  </p>
<p>Entering the competitions requires investors to hold the LBLOCK token and access the Platinum Rollers Club NFT. Draws occur daily, and investors won&#8217;t incur transaction fees for buying tokens for the draws.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Battle Infinity (IBAT) &#8211; Globally-Known Metaverse P2E Gaming Platform</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> is a Metaverse game that has flourished since its launch. Its presale was scheduled to last 90 days, but the overwhelming demand for its native token (IBAT) resulted in it selling out within 25 days.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/220680/1bi.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity metaverse project" /></figure>
<p>This crypto project grew exponentially that even celebrities got involved. Bollywood actress Urvashi Rautela and international cricketer Irfan Pathan attended the project&#8217;s exchange listing party. Their involvement added to the hype of this project, which was evidenced by the token&#8217;s price pump.</p>
<p>Because many investors missed out on the presale, they wanted another opportunity to buy IBAT. The coin was listed on PancakeSwap on 17 August 2022, and its price spiked 700% from the presale value. The price has retraced since the rally but is still up by 200% at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Battle Infinity&#8217;s popularity extended to big publishers such as The Economic Times, Analytics Insight, Bitcoinist and Outlook India. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that IBAT is the most searched cryptocurrency and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> now is because it offers investors rewards. Players can access six platforms and build teams to battle other players for IBAT tokens. Battle Infinity offers battles in IBAT Premier League, Battle Arena or Battle Games.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/220681/b-spor.jpg" alt="Metaverse sport games" /></figure>
<p>Another platform enabling players to earn tokens is Battle Stake. Players choose solo, duo or crates staking, and the most active players receive rewards from the global staking pool. In the Battle Arena, players explore the Metaverse with VR headsets and interact with other players in real-time.</p>
<p>Players can find out more about Battle Infinity&#8217;s developments by subscribing to the <a href="https://t.me/battleinfinity">Telegram channel</a>. </p>

<h3><strong>8. Terra Classic (LUNC) &#8211; Popular Blockchain Protocol Powering Global Payments</strong></h3>
<p>The Terra network has received its fair share of publicity and still remains one of the most searched cryptocurrency on Google today. The network was one of the key culprits of the crypto market crash in May 2022.</p>
<p>During that crash, Terra (LUNA) lost 99% of its value. The cause for the price plummet was TerraUSD (UST), a supposed stablecoin, losing its peg from the US dollar after holding its value for almost 18 months. Some investors lost their life savings, and the search for Terra and Luna peaked on Google during that time.</p>
<p>But Terra has managed to rise from the ashes and rebrand itself into Terra Classic. It&#8217;s a proof of stake (PoS) consensus that supports stablecoins and provides convenient global payments. Terra Classic uses an algorithm to manage the supply of stablecoins and maintains its peg with fiat currencies based on demand.</p>
<p>LUNC became one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">best crypto to buy according to Reddit</a> and its search peaked again when it announced a 1.2% tax burn. But LUNC gained traction even before the announcement of the token burn as it started pumping at the end of August. The price pump was because the majority of the original validators upgraded to the chains&#8217; new V22 code.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/252877/lunc-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="LUNC price chart" /></figure>
<p>That upgrade enabled staking and contained the code for the 1.2% tax burn. Investors who bought Terra Classic at the end of August received 500% returns by 8 September. The global monthly search volume for Terra Classic is 16,0000, with the highest search coming from the Russian Federation.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>9. Ethereum (ETH) &#8211; Pioneering Decentralized Application Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum has always been highly searched since it is the second-biggest coin by market cap. And one of the reasons for that is its various use cases that solve real-world problems. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/220895/1et.jpg" alt="Ethereum interest on Google Trends " /></figure>
<p>One of the platform&#8217;s main features is smart contracts. It runs on Ethereum&#8217;s network and is a collection of codes and data located at a specific network address. Users of smart contracts automate the execution of an agreement when certain conditions are met so all stakeholders immediately know the outcome.

<p>The key appeal of smart contracts is that anonymous parties can participate without using an intermediary. Ethereum&#8217;s network is a haven for developers. Thousands of decentralized applications are hosted on this network, which also enables sending, receiving, borrowing and earning interest of global funds.</p>
<p>Ethereum has been one of the most volatile cryptos, resulting in several bull runs. It usually follows Bitcoin&#8217;s rally and has provided investors with more than 2,000% returns during certain rallies. Although Ethereum has always trended, its online search increased with the announcement of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm">Ethereum Merge</a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/220897/cryptocurrency-g9db9ccc7f-1280.jpg" alt="GPU Ethereum miner" /></figure>
<p>The network used the original consensus, proof of work (PoW), but decided to migrate to proof of stake. Ethereum claims the reason for the migration was to run a network that is less energy intensive and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>The search for Ethereum Merge increased by 350% recently. The average monthly global searches for Ethereum is 4.1 million, with 22% of the searches originating from the US.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Shiba Inu (SHIB) &#8211; Aspiring Ethereum-based Dogecoin Alternative</strong></h3>
<p>The initial rise of meme coins occurred in 2021 with Dogecoin&#8217;s massive bull run. But the crypto market&#8217;s fascination with these coins has kept them trending well into 2023. While Dogecoin is regarded as the main meme coin, Shiba Inu is adamant about stealing some of its spotlight.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu was developed as a Dogecoin alternative and even got its name from the Japanese dog breed that Dogecoin uses on its logo. The main problem with both coins is that they don&#8217;t offer utility. But that didn&#8217;t deter investors, who mostly speculated about the coin&#8217;s price action.</p>
<p>Search for Shiba Inu coin spiked drastically during October 2021. Investors who bought the coin a month earlier profited by more than 1,200% by the end of October. SHIB&#8217;s marketing strategy and hype created on social media were effective.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/220923/shib-c.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu keyword research" /></figure>
<p>The coin had a massive rally, but it ended up being a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a> since its lack of utility resulted in a crash. SHIB lost just over 90% of its value, yet many investors still believe that it&#8217;s a good investment. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re waiting for the coin&#8217;s next big rally. And that&#8217;s evident by the 2.9 million global, monthly searches. Almost half of those searches are from the US.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://med.etoro.com/B20017_A81931_TClick.aspx" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy SHIB on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>11. Dogecoin (DOGE) &#8211; World-Renowned Meme Coin Owned by Elon Musk</strong></h3>
<p>Dogecoin is the godfather of meme coins. It doesn&#8217;t really provide better utility than the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coins,</a> but it succeeded because of celebrity endorsement.</p>
<p>Any crypto project would love to get an Elon Musk endorsement, and that&#8217;s what happened to Dogecoin. Musk admits that he owns DOGE and began aggressively touting it at the beginning of 2021. The result was a massive bull run. DOGE used to be a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm">penny crypto</a> but went on to set a new all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/252878/doge-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Dogecoin price chart" /></figure>
<p>The coin was exposed for having no utility and a crash followed, with DOGE losing 93% of its value. Although the rally and the crash happened in 2021, Google search indicates that it&#8217;s still a popular coin.</p>
<p>Dogecoin has a monthly global volume of 9.6 million searches. Just over 40% of that search is US-based. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://med.etoro.com/B20017_A81931_TClick.aspx" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy Doge on eToro</a>

<h3><strong>12. Bitcoin (BTC) &#8211; Trend-Setting Crypto with the Highest Market Capitalization</strong></h3>
<p>What would the crypto market be without Bitcoin? It&#8217;s probably best we don&#8217;t ever find out. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be developed. That happened in 2009, and it&#8217;s been 13 years since BTC has been setting trends.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always the first coin to rally in a bull run and pave the way for some of the other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> such as Ethereum and Cardano. A crypto market crash is usually the result of Bitcoin&#8217;s price falling, with altcoins following suit.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/252880/btc-all-graph-coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Bitcoin to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Besides having the highest market cap, Bitcoin is the most accepted crypto payment globally. Big corporations such as Tesla, Microsoft, Burger King and Virgin Airlines accept Bitcoin as a payment method. Whenever altcoin investors want to gauge the price action of their assets, they look to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Regardless of what altcoin investors may feel about Bitcoin&#8217;s high transaction fees or inefficient transaction processing, it&#8217;s the most popular crypto. And that&#8217;s evident by the 29 million monthly, global searches. Additionally, the majority of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a> suggest that this crypto-giant could return to its all-time highs of $68k by 2025.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87774/220932/bitcoin-serach2.jpg" alt="Bitcoin keyword research" /></figure>
<p>Ten percent of the total monthly search is from Turkey. The high inflation in Turkey has prompted many people in the country to seek a Lira alternative, which seems to be Bitcoin for many. If you&#8217;re wondering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-bitcoin.htm">how much to invest in Bitcoin</a>, many investors are adding BTC to their portfolios during the current market crash while prices continue to ride the bear waves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://med.etoro.com/B20017_A81931_TClick.aspx" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" rel="nofollow noindex">Buy Bitcoin on eToro</a>

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at Cryptos with the Most Potential</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Below we review the roadmap and tokenomics of the cryptocurrencies showing the most potential this year.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) &#8211; Crypto With the Most Potential Offering A Deflationary Model For Long Term Growth<br /></strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is an emerging crypto with the most potential, especially around the anticipation of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. </p>
<p>Its presale is strategically structured into ten stages, each offering 84 million tokens at progressively increasing prices, starting from $0.005 and rising to $0.0068. </p>
<p>This structure offers an immediate potential gain for early investors. The presale&#8217;s success is evident, having raised over $830K within 10 days of launch, showing strong community backing and investor confidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>A key attraction for $BTCETF holders is the opportunity to earn high staking rewards, over 300% at press time. This rate, however, is designed to decrease as more tokens are staked, highlighting the benefit of early participation for maximized returns. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF whitepaper</a>, the project has set aside 525 million tokens for staking rewards, ensuring a substantial incentive for early adopters.</p>
<p>In addition to the staking benefits, $BTCETF uses a deflationary mechanism to improve its value over time. The total supply of 2.1 billion tokens will be reduced through strategic burning events triggered by significant milestones in the Bitcoin ETF space. </p>
<p>These include reaching $100 million in trading volume, approval and launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, and Bitcoin surpassing a price of $100,000. These milestones are crucial in removing 525 million tokens from circulation, increasing scarcity and potential value.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Investors can get $BTCETF tokens using cryptos, including ETH, USDT, BNB, and MATIC, or through card payments via Ethereum-compatible wallets like MetaMask. </p>
<p>The project strongly focuses on community engagement, encouraging users to follow its progress on social platforms like <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token">X (Twitter)</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Bitcoin ETF Token Telegram channel</a> for real-time updates and discussions.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) &#8211; Stake-to-Mine Crypto Offers Bitcoin Cloud Mining Power, Will Rise By Over 16% on Presale </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a> is next on our list for the cryptos with the most potential. This new cryptocurrency platform makes crypto mining cheaper and more efficient for individuals. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-123859" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746786-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746786-bitcoin-minetrix-presale.png 1314w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746786-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746786-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-1024x532.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746786-bitcoin-minetrix-presale-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>By leveraging a new concept of stake-to-mine &#8211; Bitcoin Minetrix will allow individuals to access tokenized cloud mining credits. Cloud mining is a process through which companies offer rented mining times to individuals. However, this space is plagued with dubious activities and regular scams.</p>
<p>In order to protect users’ assets, Bitcoin Minetrix will tokenize cloud mining credits into ERC-20 tokens. Thus, the tokens will be recorded on a digital ledger and cannot be duplicated or stolen. In order to earn these tokens, users must buy $BTCMTX &#8211; the native cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Token holders can stake their holdings on an Etheruem-based smart contract to start generating the cloud mining credits. Moreover, staking $BTCMTX results in APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) as high as 270%. With the cloud mining credits earned &#8211; users can burn them on the ecosystem to get Bitcoin cloud mining power. </p>
<p>This will allow individuals to access allocated mining times and earn a portion of crypto and Bitcoin mining revenues. Currently, $BTCMTX is being offered through a twenty-stage presale event. From a maximum supply of 4 billion, 2.8 billion tokens are being distributed equally across twenty rounds. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-123860" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746845-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics.png" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix tokenomics" width="900" height="449" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746845-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics.png 1147w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746845-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746845-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-1024x511.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746845-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-768x383.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698746845-bitcoin-minetrix-tokenomics-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>At press time, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0111 per token. By the final round, the price will increase by 16.21% to $0.0129 per token. In only a few weeks since the presale launched, Bitcoin Minetrix has raised more than $2.1 million. </p>
<p>This high-potential crypto could soar after the exchange listing &#8211; as it offers multiple use cases and passive income-earning opportunities. Read the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix">Telegram channel</a> to stay updated with the project. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211;  High-potential Meme Token With Over a Million Supporters, Raised Over $25 Million</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> (WSM) is an emerging meme token with high growth potential backed by a strong, engaged community. Especially with the recent rise in meme coins&#8217; popularity, WSM is capturing global investor attention.</p>
<p>WSM&#8217;s creators are the same team who brought Wall St Bulls, a popular Ethereum-based Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project, into the limelight.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://thedalesreport.com/crypto-nfts/wall-street-bulls-nft-collection-sells-out-in-half-an-hour/"><u>sold out within 30 minutes of its launch</u></a>. Wall St Bulls is shifting gears toward meme coins and Bitcoin NFTs, aligning with the latest market trends.</p>
<p>In over six weeks, WSM collected over $25 million during its presale, aiming for a hard cap of $30 million. This investor response highlights the token&#8217;s promising future. </p>
<p>Notably, big industry names, including Elon Musk, have shown interest by <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954">engaging with WSM on Twitter</a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87114/316958/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-.jpg" alt="wall street memes presale website" /></figure>
<p>The strong support from WSM&#8217;s community which exceeds over 1 million, sets it apart. This active engagement can protect the token from typical &#8216;pump and dump&#8217; scenarios linked with meme coins, providing a chance for sustained stability.</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>WSM&#8217;s whitepaper</u></a> lays out a community-focused distribution plan: half of the two billion tokens are set aside for marketing, with 30% allocated for community rewards and 20% for exchange liquidity. There is no token allocation to the team, reducing the likelihood of a market dump.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>WSM plans to airdrop $50,000 worth of rewards to its active social media followers to maintain community interest. </p>

<h3><strong>6. eTukTuk (TUK) &#8211; Green Crypto With Low-Cost EVs That Help Drivers Increase Earnings by 4x</strong></h3>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s emerging green crypto platform, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/"><u>eTukTuk</u></a>, aims to transform its traditional three-wheeler, or TukTuk, system. </p>
<p>By combining eco-friendly actions and digital rewards, eTukTuk plans to use electric TukTuks to tackle carbon emissions and bridge economic gaps.</p>
<p>Their goal? Make fuel-based TukTuks electric. This switch has two major benefits. Firstly, this will contribute to reducing carbon emissions and help clean air. Also, drivers could see profits surge by 400% as electric TukTuks help reduce maintenance and other costs.</p>
<p>The platform’s native crypto token, $TUK, fuels the project. The token&#8217;s about to launch, with presale whitelisting in progress.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/315134/etuktuk-cardano.jpg" alt="etuktuk presale homepage" /></figure>
<p>Backing this green platform is Sri Lanka&#8217;s Capital Maharaja Group, a large Sri Lankan conglomerate with a 20% stake in eTukTuk. eTukTuk&#8217;s vision also includes affordable electric vehicles and charging stations for everyone. </p>
<p>Moreover, by harnessing blockchain, they offer digital identities to improve financial inclusivity and address economic imbalances.</p>
<p>If you buy $TUK tokens, you can stake them and earn yearly returns from solar-powered charging stations across cities and towns. The money from these stations gets shared with local partners.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86472/315135/etuktuk-features.jpg" alt="etuktuk how it works" /></figure>
<p>eTukTuk isn&#8217;t just a transport project. Its platform aims to blend transportation, economic development, and eco-friendly actions. They&#8217;re creating a future where these three pillars can coexist.</p>
<p>You can join the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>eTukTuk Telegram channel</u></a> to keep tabs on the project.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Chimpzee – Empowering People to Act with Attractive Passive Income</strong></h3>
<p>If you have been looking for a way into climate action but don’t have a lot of time to spare, you should check out <a href="/ext/chimpzee/">Chimpzee</a>. In a unique approach based on human psychology, Chimpzee incentivizes more people to be a part of climate action and wildlife conservation.</p>
<p>This is interesting because there have been many environmental initiatives dedicated to these causes in the past. But they have a low engagement rate and scalability. </p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87114/275734/image1.jpg" alt="chimpzee presale graphic" /></strong></p>
<p>Chimpzee solves this problem by bringing crypto rewards into the picture. The environment can’t wait for humans to come to their senses and join these efforts voluntarily. So, rewards are the answer. Not just one, but multiple streams of rewards will attract a wide range of users to Chimpzee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Play to earn (The Zero Tolerance Game) – Earn CHMPZ coins by achieving a series of predetermined benchmarks. </li>
<li>Trade to earn (NFT marketplace) – If you are an active trading user on the network or Chimpanzee NFT holder, earn a percentage of the trading fee profits.</li>
<li>Shop to earn (Merchandise store) – Earn CHMPZ rewards by buying unique Chimpzee merchandise and supporting the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chimpzee allocates 10% of its CHMPZ token supply and a share of its profits to initiatives dedicated to saving animals, stopping deforestation, and combating climate change.</p>
<p>The key assets of the platform are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited editions of Chimpzee NFT passports that will give holders multiple benefits and rewards. </li>
<li>CHMPZ coins, which will be used for a wide range of payments in the ecosystem, including the purchase of Chimpzee NFT passports. CHMPZ used to purchase Chimpzee NFT Passports will be burned and taken out of circulation, giving upward pressure to the price of both the crypto and NFTs in the open market. The burnt tokens could amount to up to 10% of the total circulating supply.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87114/275735/image2.jpg" alt="chimpzee presale stages" /></figure>
<p>Leading initiatives like The Giving Block, One Tree Planted, and Wild have joined forces with Chimpzee on its mission. In the coming months, we can expect the network to expand and reach a wider global user base. That would, in turn, boost the demand for the token, bringing generous returns to early presale investors of CHMPZ coins. The CHMPZ presale is now open. It is the most profitable gateway to the project, and is the only way to receive free bonus tokens.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Presale investors get up to 100% free bonus tokens and around $450k has been raised so far. </p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> is a cryptocurrency analytics platform that allows members to access trading insights from the top AI developers and financial quants. These insights are offered as predictive models, which predict the future outlook of cryptocurrency markets. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87114/275833/ypred-potential.jpg" alt="ypredict benefits and features" /></figure>
<p>The insights are provided in the form of AI-based trading signals and sentiment analysis. Moreover, yPredict uses a patent-pending chart recognition algorithm, which analyzes whether a certain token is bearish or bullish. </p>
<p>While $YPRED is still on presale, users who acquire the token can extract it in multiple ways. Apart from the subscriptions, members can stake tokens in a staking pool. 10% of all new subscriptions are sent to this pool.

<p>yPredict has a total supply of 100 billion tokens and has offered 8% through the presale. Currently, the token is priced at $0.1 but will rise by 33.3% to $0.12 by the final stage. Notably, an 8% tax is levied on selling $YPRED, which will help avoid regular pump and dumps. </p>
<p>yPredict has collected over $3.8 million since the presale started. Read the <a href="https://docs.ypredict.ai/">yPredict whitepaper</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/ypredict">Telegram group</a> to stay updated with this project. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Doge Uprising &#8211; ERC20 PoS Doge Inspired Coin With High Potential &amp; Celebrity Appeal</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeuprising/"><u>Doge Uprising ($DUP)</u></a> is a new campaign that centers around a story as opposed to a central icon. The year is 2045, and Mark Zuckerberg has total command of world surveillance. The only way to put a stop to him is with a group of elite Doge Mecha NFTs, piloted by investors, and led by Elon Musk.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87114/334310/screen-shot-2023-10-19-at.jpg" alt="doge uprising presale website" /></figure>
<p>Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg were previously rumored to be getting involved in a cage fight, so this presale could benefit from the celebrity appeal of these two icons. And Musk has long been known to increase the price of Doge with his tweets, and for interacting with meme related presales such as Wall Street Memes.</p>
<p>Investors can benefit by purchasing a Doge Mecha NFT, by staking rewards, and by $DUP appreciation. In fact, a 100% increase is certain in terms of the price difference between current and later stage investment. The current price per $DUP is a mere $0.000013, which will 2x in the next stage to $0.000026.</p>
<p>While meme-inspired coins are known for volatility and a lack of transparency, Doge Uprising has conducted a <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/documents/SolidProof-Audit.pdf"><u>smart contact audit from SolidProof</u></a>. No medium or high severity issues were located, and the contract was regarded as safe for deployment. This is a positive indication in terms of overall transparency. <a href="https://twitter.com/akira_ethx"><u>Akira.Eth</u></a>, a Doge Mecha and project CEO, is also available on Twitter for queries. This is separate from the <a href="https://twitter.com/Doge_Uprising"><u>official Twitter channe</u></a>l for this campaign.</p>

<p>There are 450 billion tokens in total with 270 billion available in the presale. To take part in the uprising, a compatible Web3 wallet (such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect) is a prerequisite, along with ETH, BNB, or USDT.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Ripple (XRP) &#8211; Efficient Cross-Border Payments Platform</strong></h3>
<p>XRP is the native token of Ripple&#8217;s network. It has developed a platform enabling users to send funds globally while incurring extremely affordable fees. Ripple&#8217;s efficient network ensures XRP tokens reach beneficiaries within less than a minute, sometimes in mere seconds.</p>
<p>This coin has shown tremendous resilience in maintaining a position in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, even though it&#8217;s the only coin of the bunch not to have had a massive price rally. That means XRP is the crypto with the highest growth potential.</p>
<p>The support XRP receives from its community has enabled it to have significant price rallies, despite the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ongoing-ripple-sec-lawsuit-is-causing-ripple-xrp-investors-to-buy-up-chronolyio-crno.htm">ongoing Ripple lawsuit with the US SEC</a>. XRP&#8217;s price crashed to $0.17 with the announcement of the lawsuit, but it pumped to $1.97 just a few months later.  </p>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s network has partnered with major banks in Asia and the rest of the world to provide an efficient payment platform. But this project is constantly expanding. Its latest development is a $250 million commitment to enable creators to host their NFTs on the XRP ledger.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) &#8211; Bitcoin Fork Platform for Bulk Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>Many investors in the crypto community have referred to Bitcoin (BTC) as gold 2.0 and a store of value. Although Bitcoin is the biggest coin by market cap, it&#8217;s not the fastest or the cheapest. Hence the Bitcoin fork.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash was developed to enable investors affordable and efficient peer-to-peer transactions. While Bitcoin is considered to be like a gold bar, Bitcoin Cash is like a credit card to use for daily transactions. Sending Bitcoin Cash globally costs mere pennies and can occur sometimes within seconds.</p>
<p>A cryptocurrency with the most potential has to have strong fundamentals. Bitcoin Cash has evidenced that by being one of the main coins, alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, to be listed on major exchanges. Even Paypal has Bitcoin Cash as one of the few coins on its platform.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash solves Bitcoin&#8217;s problem. The other advantage of investing in BCH over BTC is that it&#8217;s much cheaper to own. It&#8217;s currently at strong support, and it has major upside potential, unlike Bitcoin because of the rally it already had.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>12. Stellar Lumens (XLM) &#8211; Low-Cost Global Transfer Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Stellar Lumens provides a similar offering to Ripple&#8217;s network and considers itself an open network for storing and moving money. A key distinguishing feature of this network is the ability to create, send and trade digital representations of all forms of money.</p>
<p>The network&#8217;s developers designed the platform to enable global financial systems to function together. But Stellar Lumens is also enabling small corporations to have the same reach as major banks. Users can develop global payment apps and use the tokens on the network to leverage payments.</p>
<p>The platform hosts a decentralized exchange. Besides crypto, investors can use the exchange for forex and security trading. Stellar Lumens has a built-in protocol simplifying the swapping of tokens.</p>
<p>Another key feature is the micropayment service. It enables investors to send borderless payments of any size while incurring low, flat fees and fast transactions.</p>

<h3><strong>13. Ethereum (ETH) &#8211; Smart Contract Platform Hosting Numerous NFT Projects</strong></h3>
<p>Ever wondered what the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-energy-efficient-cryptocurrency.htm">most energy-efficient crypto</a> of 2023 is? Ethereum has the second-highest market cap, and it&#8217;s the crypto with the highest potential to dethrone Bitcoin from the top spot. It&#8217;s a software platform that powers the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and many decentralized applications.</p>
<p>A key benefit of using Ethereum&#8217;s network is smart contracts. Ethereum&#8217;s platform provides a peer-to-peer network that executes and verifies an application code, known as smart contracts. That enables users to transact with each other without a central authority.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a> are a growing phenomenon, and many NFT projects are hosted on Ethereum. To buy certain NFTs, investors need to own Ethereum. Analyst estimates are that the NFT marketplace will grow by $147 billion by 2026. The more the marketplace expands, the higher the demand for Ethereum will grow.</p>
<p>A big development for this project is the Ethereum Merge. It&#8217;s a technical upgrade that will reduce the network&#8217;s carbon emissions and convert Ethereum from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake network.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>14. Cardano (ADA) &#8211; Proof-of-Stake Platform Facilitating Peer-to-Peer Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>ADA is the token powering the Cardano network, a proof-of-stake blockchain network. The developers designed the network to be more efficient than proof-of-work networks, making it more sustainable, flexible and scalable for smart contracts.</p>
<p>Using the Cardano network enables users to benefit from the developments of decentralized finance apps, games and new crypto coins. It&#8217;s Cardano&#8217;s use cases that prompted the market to react favorably to ADA and increase the demand for the coin.</p>
<p>ADA was one of the few coins to surge with Bitcoin in 2021. Investors who bought ADA at the end of 2020 received more than 2,000% returns by September 2021. Since setting an all-time high (ATH), Cardano has lost 87% of its value but has recovered slightly.</p>
<p>Some crypto pundits believe that Cardano&#8217;s network will reshape blockchain and that another ADA rally is imminent. That could make ADA one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy right now.</a></p>

<p><i>Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>15. Solana (SOL) &#8211; High-Performance Platform Supporting Builders Globally</strong></h3>
<p>Using the Solana network costs a few pennies per transaction, and the platform is capable of processing 2,295 transactions per second on average. The network wants to make itself more scalable by enabling 65,000 transactions to be processed in a second.</p>
<p>Solana provides a platform for developers to design a scalable, user-friendly app. It&#8217;s a cryptocurrency with the highest potential due to its rapidly growing ecosystem, hosting thousands of crypto projects such as NFTs, DeFi and Web3.</p>
<p>The platform enables users to avoid dealing with fragmented Layer 2 systems or shared chains. As its network scales, Solana maintains a single global state. That ensures composability between ecosystem projects.</p>
<p>SOL has made a huge impression on investors and earned early ones massive rewards. Investors who bought the coin in January 2021 received rewards of more than 20,000% by the end of the year.</p>
<p>While it is down at the moment, SOL could bounce back making it a key <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm">crypto to watch</a> in the coming months.</p>

<h3><strong>16. Decentraland (MANA) &#8211; Top Metaverse P2E Crypto Game</strong></h3>
<p>Metaverse games enabling players to earn rewards while entertaining themselves have become extremely popular. One of the biggest NFT games at the moment is Decentraland. It enables players to buy LAND, parcels used for infrastructure building.</p>
<p>Players can monetize their land with the MANA token and enhance it with assets to sell it potentially for a profit. The game also enables players to explore Decentraland to experience magnificent scenery, ranging from a medieval dungeon maze to a village.</p>
<p>The game enables players to create artwork and challenges by using the builder tool. Players can enter events to win prizes, and the game&#8217;s ability to buy and sell LAND has motivated several big brands to buy prime real estate in Decentraland. Major bank JP Morgan bought a piece of real estate in Decentraland.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>17. Uniswap (UNI) &#8211; Leading Decentralized Crypto Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>The last cryptocurrency with the most potential is UNI, the native token of the decentralized exchange Uniswap. Besides hosting numerous cryptos, Uniswap also has a growing network of DeFi apps. </p>
<p>Uniswap hosts more than 80 tokens designed to be Ethereum-based and enables users to swap tokens directly from their wallets. It doesn&#8217;t use traditional order books the way regular exchanges do, as it&#8217;s an automated market maker (AMM) relying on smart contracts.</p>
<p>At the heart of the exchange is the native token UNI. Investors who bought the coin at the end of 2020 went on a massive bull run until April 2021, providing returns of more than 1,200%.</p>

<h2><strong>Discovering Crypto with the Most Potential</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors can use several methods to find cryptocurrencies showing signs of potentially providing massive returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Research Crypto Presales</strong></h3>
<p>A crypto presale provides a good indication of how in-demand a coin is. It usually precedes an ICO, so if its presale was successful, the coin stands a high chance of having a price pump when it starts trading on major exchanges.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/87114/219278/ibat-2.jpg" alt="battle infinity presale raise" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Follow Crypto News</strong></h3>
<p>The latest developments within the crypto ecosystem are reported in the news. Investors should follow the latest updates to see which crypto projects are developing their platforms to improve the blockchain network.</p>
<p>As an example, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-could-trigger-surge-of-interest-staking-entice-institutional-buyers.htm">Ethereum Merge could trigger a surge of interest in staking</a> and will reduce the network&#8217;s energy consumption and make it more environmentally friendly. </p>
<h2><strong>How We Selected Crypto Projects with the Most Potential</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cryptocurrencies with big potential provide certain clues about the rewards they can provide, with some investors hoping to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-rich-off-crypto.htm">get rich off cryptos</a> in 2023.</p>
<h3><strong>Bull Runs</strong></h3>
<p>All of the established coins we researched provided investors with high returns during their rallies. Most had several bull cycles in their price history, some even during lawsuits with government institutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-volatile-cryptos.htm">Volatile crypto</a> assets with high liquidity have the potential to pump again.</p>
<h3><strong>Utility</strong></h3>
<p>Meme coins have proven that a crypto project needs to provide utility to have longevity. The degree of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-is-cryptocurrency-utility-and-why-its-important-for-the-development-of-crypto-payments.htm">crypto utilit</a>y a project provides depends on how big of a problem it solves.</p>
<p>The more utility a project has, the more investors deem it to be valuable and are likely to invest in it. This can be seen in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-real-world-asset-tokens.htm">best real-world asset tokens</a> such as Bitcoin ETF Token and Chainlink which represent traditional financial assets on cryptocurrency blockchains. </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Thousands of cryptos occupy the blockchain network, but only a few have the potential to provide investors with significant returns.</p>
<p>One of the top cryptocurrencies we have reviewed on this list is Bitcoin ETF Token. Currently on presale, $BTCETF is priced at just $0.0052 per token. The price will rise to $0.0068 by the end of the presale.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) are at the core of blockchain. As the name implies, they&#8217;re decentralized protocols not controlled by a central authority.

<h2><strong>Closely Reviewing the 11 Best Crypto DAOs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the Best Crypto DAOs in the section below.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong>Best Crypto <strong>With </strong><strong>Over 500% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Up To 25% Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is the best crypto presale built to take advantage of the events around the Bitcoin spot ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Aside from the speculative value, the token has deflationary measures that will remove 5% of the total token supply when each of the five milestones around the ETF approval unfold.</p>
<p>This includes the approval and launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF. With a total of 25% of the tokens permanently removed from circulation, the token should see a positive effect on its price.</p>
<p>Participate in the $BTCETF token presale by connecting your Ethereum wallet with the Bitcoin ETF Token website. Use ETH, USDT or card to complete the purchase and avoid MATIC and BNB as $BTCETF tokens purchased with these two coins aren&#8217;t eligible for the staking rewards.</p>

<p>With 10 stages in the token presale, it may be prudent to buy as early as possible. That&#8217;s because the token price slightly increases with each stage, starting from $0.0050 in the first stage up to $0.0068 in the final stage. That&#8217;s a 36% difference alone.</p>
<p>But even if you don&#8217;t buy in the early stages, stake your tokens to earn 500% APY and maximize your potential rewards. This number will drop, though, as more tokens are bought and staked, so make sure to stake as early as possible if you&#8217;re planning to participate in the presale.</p>

<h3>2<strong>. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Tokenized Bitcoin Cloud Mining with High Staking Rewards, Raised Nearly $1 Million</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix</u></a> is an upcoming community-focused platform that offers tokenized cloud mining, ensuring transparency, security, and high returns for investors. </p>
<p>This mechanism is enabled by an innovative &#8220;Stake-to-Mine&#8221; model, a much-needed change from traditional Bitcoin mining&#8217;s environmental concerns.</p>
<p>The platform has shown high investor traction within a brief span since its launch, securing nearly $1 million in just over two weeks. The initial token price is at $0.011, which will reach $0.0129 by the end of the presale.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/333393/screenshot-2023-10-11-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The platform has a 4 billion $BTCMTX supply cap with mining, staking, and marketing allocations.</p>
<p>With an eco-centric approach, Bitcoin Minetrix promises a solution without energy-intensive practices. By staking the $BTCMTX token, users earn non-tradable mining credits. </p>
<p>When burned, these credits enable users to tap into Bitcoin mining power, simplifying mining while countering the challenges of older mining models dominated by cash contracts. </p>
<p>This strategy reduces environmental strain and empowers users to mine Bitcoin efficiently, sidestepping the shortfalls of third-party cloud mining scams.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</u></a>, the platform offers an integrated dashboard to track essential metrics easily. </p>
<p>This dashboard provides a holistic view of mining activities, from hashing power and mining credit statistics to potential returns, ensuring users have all crucial data at their fingertips. </p>
<p>The bonus? Mobile optimization ensures mining enthusiasts can engage and monitor their activities on the go.</p>

<p>Additionally, the high-yielding potential of Bitcoin Minetrix is evident in its impressive APY, surpassing 500% at press time. Nearly 70 million tokens were staked in the initial two weeks, showing high community trust.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix also underwent a comprehensive audit by Coinsult to ensure trust and integrity. Investors can participate in the presale using ETH, BNB, or USDT. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Gigantic Presale with $25 Million Raised and 1 Million Social Followers, Now Listed On OKX</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes (WSM)</u></a> is one of the most successful presale of 2023, as gauged by celebrity interaction, social following, and amount raised.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes presale began in late May, quickly raising over $25 million. After rushing through the presale stages, OKX listed the $WSM tokens on 26 September, which surged by over 275% in just 4 days post-listing.</p>
<p>Across its many social profiles, including <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram</u></a>, it has over 1 million followers. Even Elon Musk has commented on some of the memes issued forth by this campaign. </p>
<p><br /><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/330886/screen-shot-2023-09-20-at.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token presale page" /></p>
<p>No other presale matches Wall Street Memes when it comes to financial backing, celebrity endorsement, or social following. It aims for a $1 billion market capitalization, hoping to follow the likes of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. </p>
<p>It has a similar theme to both of these meme coins, aiming to remedy the difference between retail investors and greedy wall street figures who manipulate the market for their own interest.</p>
<p>This is a hot theme that many can resonate with. Some of the memes are very accurate and entertaining, seeing much interaction on social media. The campaign also features a $50,000 airdrop giveaway as well as double digit staking rewards.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes Whitepaper</u></a> can be read in order to understand the risk/reward ratio of this token in more detail. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Tamadoge &#8211;  Emerging DAO Crypto Project Listed on OKX</strong></h3>
<p>The players on <a href="https://tamadoge.io/">Tamadoge</a> are at the core of this play to earn community. The platform enables players to compete for the highest rewards by climbing the leaderboard. To collect the highest rewards, players need to nurture their digital pets into adults.</p>
<p>Tamadoge rewards players who have done the best job of grooming their pets with the highest number of TAMA tokens. Players can exercise, feed and breed pets and then put them in battles against other pets once their strength has developed.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/222995/fight-tamadoge.jpg" alt="Tamadoge crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The platform aims to introduce an augmented reality app in 2023, which will make the player&#8217;s interaction with the pets more realistic. Another feature to be added will be the P2E Arcade games. </p>
<p>Apart from earning rewards to exchange them for fiat currencies, players can also take advantage of TAMA ownership. This project raised $19 million during its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">token presale</a>, which sold out in less than two months.</p>
<p>The high demand for TAMA tokens during the presale has prompted the developers to accelerate its crypto exchange listings. TAMA is now <a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">listed on OKX</a> with more expected to be announced.</p>
<p>Traders that can&#8217;t access its CEX or prefer DEXes can also opt for <a href="https://gridglass48.co/box_e21746db23bf872d9ccb887db0c824a4">OKX&#8217;s decentralized exchange</a>.  </p>
<p>The increased exposure that Tamadoge received during its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">initial coin offering</a> (ICO) including from Cointelegraph should increase the demand. then the 5% token burn on transactions in pet store purchases will decrease its supply. TAMA&#8217;s supply is capped at 2 billion coins and will decrease over time because of the token burn, making it a scarce asset.</p>
<p>Investors can get the latest information about this project by subscribing to the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram channel</a>. <i>(Admins never message subscribers first, beware of scams).</i></p>

<h3><strong>5. Battle Infinity &#8211; Popular Game Providing 6 Decentralized Platforms</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> enables players to roam around the Metaverse with VR headsets and access 6 decentralized platforms. The main battles happen in the IBAT Premier League, and players build up teams to compete for prizes.</p>
<p>The in-game currency is IBAT. The platform rewards players with IBAT tokens for winning leagues, monetizing land and contributing to the ecosystem. Even if players haven&#8217;t won leagues, Battle Infinity rewards the most active players from the global staking pool.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/222999/batt-swp.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity Battle Swap exchange" /></figure>
<p>Players can enter Battle Arena with their unique avatars and explore virtual land while interacting with players in real time. Battle Infinity provides players with complete control over the rewards they earn by staking.</p>
<p>The platform enables players to battle it out for the highest rewards via solo, duo and crates staking. Battle Infinity has proven to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-staking-platforms.htm">best crypto staking platforms</a> by adding decentralized flexible and time-lock staking. Opting for time-lock staking for 12 months can earn investors up to 25% interest.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223000/battle-staking.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity token staking" /></figure>
<p>At the onset of this project, Battle Infinity proved it would be successful. Its presale sold out within 25 days of the scheduled 90 days. </p>
<p>Then, IBAT was listed on PancakeSwap and surged 700% from its presale price. That was followed by a listing on DeFi platform and DEX Coin98, and centralized exchange LBank.</p>
<p>More developments are in the pipeline, and investors can get the latest information by joining the <a href="https://t.me/battleinfinity">Battle Infinity Telegram channel</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Lucky Block &#8211; Top Decentralized Competition Platform Offering Major Prizes</strong></h3>
<p>A key reason <a href="https://luckyblock.com/">Lucky Block</a> used blockchain to develop its ecosystem was to provide a decentralized competition platform that was fair and transparent. By decentralizing the platform, Lucky Block provided instantaneous payouts to winners and disabled third parties from interfering in the results.</p>
<p>Originally, this competition platform offered watches and holidays as the main prizes. But it&#8217;s increased the stakes by offering a Lamborghini, $1 million in Bitcoin and a $1 million home. Investors need to own the platform&#8217;s native token, LBLOCK, to enter draws. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223001/lucky-s.jpg" alt="Lucky Block rewards" /></figure>
<p>The benefit of buying LBLOCK for competitions is that transaction fees don&#8217;t apply. Lucky Block is constantly looking for ways to make its platform more affordable. With the development of the ERC-20 token, known as LBLOCK V2, investors can buy the coin without incurring the 12% sales tax they would with the V1 token.</p>
<p>The V2 token has made exchange listings easier. To date, LBLOCK is listed on LBank, MEXC, PancakeSwap and Gate.io. More exchange listings will follow. That&#8217;s beneficial to investors because the coin surged more than 1,100% when it was listed on PancakeSwap in January 2022. The bull run needed just over 2 weeks to provide investors with massive returns.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223005/lblock-2.jpg" alt="LBLOCK token price chart" /></figure>
<p>Another key development of Lucky Block is its token burn. A 1% monthly burn will commence on 30 September 2022. And the intention behind the burn is to make the coin more scarce, which should result in its value increasing.</p>

<h3><strong>7. DeFi Swap &#8211; Well-Known Decentralized Exchange with Staking Ability</strong>   </h3>
<p>Besides being a decentralized exchange, DeFi Swap enables the swapping of ERC-20 compatible tokens across multiple networks.</p>
<p>DeFi Swap is a non-custodial exchange, enabling it to move funds without having ownership of investors&#8217; assets. It relies on liquidity generated from farming by investors to remain operational.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223029/defi.jpg" alt="DeFi Coin protocol" /></p>
<p>At the center of DeFi Swap is the exchange&#8217;s native token, DeFi Coin (DEFC). Investors can use DEFC as a medium for token swapping. Another key benefit of owning this token is the potential earnings. </p>
<p>Investors can <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/earn-passive-income-and-interest-on-your-cryptocurrencies-with-these-four-platforms.htm">earn passive income with cryptocurrencies</a> in several ways, and one of them is by staking the coin. Locking up the coin for 12 months could earn investors up to 75% yield. That is one of the highest yield rates exchanges offer for locking up coins.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223033/defi-stake.jpg" alt="DeFi Swap staking pools" /></figure>
<p>Another passive income stream with the project is the static rewards mechanism. The exchange provides income to investors from funds collected via the 10% tax levied on the trading of the DeFi Coin.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Uniswap &#8211; Famous Exchange on Decentralized Protocol</strong></h3>
<p>Uniswap is the company that built the Uniswap protocol. It&#8217;s also a decentralized exchange and the name of the platform&#8217;s exchange token. Uniswap has established a huge following in the decentralized exchange community.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons for its success is the enabling of swapping, earning and building on its platform. It enables developers to build their own DeFi Apps by providing guides, protocol documentation and the necessary tools. The Uniswap Grant Program provides funding to developers that build apps and tools on the Uniswap protocol.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223055/uniswap-t.jpg" alt="Uniswap ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>Owning the UNI token enables investors to be part of the global community governing the protocol. This governance token enables holders to vote on off-chain proposals, participate in upgrade discussions and vote on Uniswap governance proposals. </p>
<p>The ecosystem consists of developers, users, designers and educators who decide the future of the platform and govern the protocol via the on-chain governance process. To ensure that the community governs the network, Uniswap has allocated 60% of the UNI genesis supply to members.</p>
<p>The rest of the supply has been allocated to team members and future employees, as well as investors with 4-years vesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy UNI on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>9. Compound &#8211; Autonomous Interest Rate Protocol with Compound Governance</strong></h3>
<p>Compound is one of the best DAO crypto projects, offering an autonomous interest rate protocol and safe crypto custody for trading and staking.</p>
<p>This ecosystem is ideal for investors wanting to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies or to lock in their coins to earn interest. The key advantage of borrowing crypto from Compound is that this decentralized ecosystem doesn&#8217;t conduct credit checks to determine eligibility.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223069/comp.jpg" alt="Compound market overview" /></figure>
<p>COMP is an ERC-20 token that governs the Compound protocol. Coin holders have the right to debate, propose and vote on protocol changes. Compound prefers governance of its protocol to remain with users to create a large ecosystem and incentivize them with tokens to ensure the platform&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>Daily distribution of 1,234 COMP tokens goes to protocol users, and token holders set the distribution through the governance process. To receive COMP tokens automatically, investors need to use this DAO platform by supplying or borrowing assets.</p>

<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>10. Aave &#8211; DAO Project Offering Supplying and Borrowing of Assets</strong></h3>
<p>Many investors consider Aave to be a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long term crypto project to invest in</a> because it&#8217;s an open-source liquidity protocol that enables interest to be earned on supplied and borrowed assets.</p>
<p>Developers can use Aave to build applications, and the platform&#8217;s token holders participate in its governance and vote on new assets, upgrades and proposals. The DAO cryptocurrency at the core of this protocol is AAVE.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223092/aave.jpg" alt="Aave liquidity protocol" /></figure>
<p>Investors can deposit their AAVE coins into the protocol and earn rewards. Another option is to supply the protocol and monitor asset growth due to being a liquidity provider. Investors can borrow against their collateral across multiple networks and assets.</p>
<p>Using Aave isn&#8217;t the only way investors benefit. It&#8217;s also by holding the protocol&#8217;s token. Investors who bought AAVE at the end of 2020 didn&#8217;t have to wait long to receive massive rewards. The coin rallied until May 2021, providing returns of just over 2,000%.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Buy AAVE on eToro</a>
<p><i>Cryptoassets are highly volatile and unregulated. No consumer protection. Tax on profits may apply.</i></p>
<h3><strong>11. Lido Finance &#8211; Top-Tier DAO Platform Enabling Compound Yielding</strong></h3>
<p>Lido DAO is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> right now, as it offers investors great returns. Investors who bought the coin in July 2022 immediately went on an epic bull run, surging more than 300% by the beginning of August. That&#8217;s impressive considering it happened during a bear market.</p>
<p>Owning Lido DAO also enables investors to be part of the process that governs Lido&#8217;s liquidity staking protocol. Lido Finance enables investors to stake various digital assets to earn compound yields. Investors can use their tokens for collateral, lending and yield farming.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223123/lido.jpg" alt="Lido liquid staking" /></figure>
<p>The Lido community builds liquid staking services and governs the direction of the staking protocols by owning the coin and voting. </p>
<p>This protocol has provided a Lido Ecosystem Grants Organisation (LEGO). The grants provided to contributors are valuable resources for improving the protocol and the staking ecosystem. The incentives provided fuel the protocol&#8217;s growth and ensure that Lido provides a beneficial staking platform.</p>
<p>Investors can use Lido to stake Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot and Kusama. Polygon staking on this protocol provides the highest returns, with investors earning an annual percentage rate (APR) of up to 16.5%.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a Crypto DAO?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>DAO is the acronym for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-dao.htm">decentralized autonomous organizations</a>. Its system enables community members to vote on certain decisions regarding the protocol, thereby determining its future.</p>
<p>Since no central authority governs a particular crypto DAO ecosystem, its governance is solely with the users. Smart contracts are used to enable all parties involved to partake in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Each stakeholder&#8217;s voting power is determined based on the number of governance tokens held. More voting power is granted to investors holding a large stake because they&#8217;re trusted to act in good faith.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223157/tt.jpg" alt="Tamadoge ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>Some of the matters that token holders might vote on are how the DAO&#8217;s treasury distributes the funds to platform users or which assets to buy. </p>
<h2><strong>Is DAO Crypto a Worthwhile Investment?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Many DAO crypto projects offer investors several benefits such as not needing a third party to conduct certain financial transactions. No specific person owns a DAO, which enables users to vote on the operations and future of the protocol.</p>
<p>Transparency is a big factor that makes investors gravitate toward DAO projects. Votes are available to the public on the blockchain, and no entity can tamper with the votes or influence them.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88793/223215/blockchain-g167f4ef8f-640.jpg" alt="Blockchain" /></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s the users who ultimately decide how they want the protocol to function and the benefits it should provide. Although DAOs may seem like a financial haven, they are also risky.</p>
<p>Not having a central authority run operations means that a support center isn&#8217;t available to attend to a user&#8217;s query. Reversing or correcting transactions is almost impossible, and information about the project is usually limited to its whitepaper. </p>
<p>To determine if a DAO is a suitable investment, each investor needs to do their due diligence on DAOs to know their features and benefits. Once investors are certain they fully understand these protocols, they should compare DAO offerings to their investment goals.</p>
<p>If the two align, then investors may believe that a DAO project is a worthwhile investment. Investors should ensure that a project is legit. Usually, protocols that have processed large amounts, high volume of transactions and have a big community tend to be less risky than small protocols. </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Some projects provide tremendous value to investors, yet have a low DAO crypto price. While not being a DAO in the traditional sense of the word Bitcoin ETF Token offers a great way to earn triple digit staking rewards and will potentially list on a Tier 1 exchange in the near future, which could potentially result in substantial prices increases.</p>

<h2><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en"><strong>Invest in Tamadoge on OKX C</strong></a><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What is crypto DAO?</strong></p>
<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a transparent protocol controlled by its members. It uses a bottom-up management model to enable governance token holders to decide the way the protocol will function and its future.</p>
<p><strong>How does crypto DAO work?</strong></p>
<p>DAO platforms are fully autonomous, and smart contracts are used for transparency and to determine the rules. A DAO also uses smart contracts to execute the decisions agreed upon by the users, which are the platform&#8217;s governance token holders. The platform&#8217;s users vote on proposals, and the weight of their votes is determined by the number of tokens held.  </p>

<h2><strong>Analyzing the Most Profitable Cryptocurrency to Buy</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Buying and selling cryptocurrency for profit is a long term strategy only if investors know the right coins to trade. Let&#8217;s find out what the 10 most profitable cryptocurrencies offer investors besides high returns.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; </strong><strong>Most Profitable Crypto </strong><strong>With </strong><strong>Over 500% Staking APY And </strong><strong>Up To 25% Token Burn Mechanics</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> is a token presale aiming to reward holders based on events around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With every milestone reached around the Bitcoin ETF, the team will burn 5% of the total supply with the goal to burn up to 25%. Typically, this deflationary measure helps the token price in the long run.</p>
<p>Buy $BTCETF tokens on the Bitcoin ETF Token website by connecting your MetaMask wallet, and use ETH, USDT or card to complete the transaction. The presale site lets you buy $BTCETF tokens with MATIC and BNB but this isn&#8217;t recommended because you won&#8217;t be eligible for the staking APY.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="461" class="alignnone wp-image-130203 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699860442-btc-etf-token-3-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Similar to other presales, the $BTCETF presale runs in 10 stages where each stage will have a higher token price than the previous stage. In the first presale stage, $BTCETF tokens will sell for $0.0050 and in the last stage for $0.0068. If you buy during the first stage and sell at a price of the last stage, you&#8217;ll earn 36% right off the bat.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you buy in later stages, though. With an APY of 500%, you can earn more tokens by staking them. Of course, this number won&#8217;t stay high. With more tokens being bought and staked, the APY will drop, which makes it prudent to stake as early as possible to take advantage of the high APY.</p>

<h3>2<strong>. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211;  Crypto Token Transforming Bitcoin Cloud Mining with an Eco-Friendly Approach</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix</u></a> is a trending new profitable crypto in the Bitcoin cloud mining domain. Its efficient and eco-friendly approach with strong investor support makes it one of the most cryptos in the market with an upside potential.</p>
<p>Their presale has caught significant investor attention, raising over $800,000 within the first two weeks of its launch. The token&#8217;s introductory presale rate is $0.011 and is expected to touch $0.0129 by stage 20 of the presale.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/333128/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix token presale page" /></figure>
<p>In an era where the environmental implications of Bitcoin mining are under investors’ radar, Bitcoin Minetrix offers a unique solution while allowing users to earn passive income. </p>
<p>Their cloud mining mechanism is eco-friendly, removing traditional energy-intentive methods. This reduces the carbon footprint and presents a more cost-effective avenue for individual miners.</p>
<p>Traditional Bitcoin mining is known for its challenges—high costs, complex setups, and environmental strain. Bitcoin Minetrix tackles these with its novel &#8220;Stake-to-Mine&#8221; model. </p>
<p>By staking the native $BTCMTX token, users receive non-tradable mining credits. Upon burning these credits, Bitcoin rewards are unlocked. </p>
<p>This approach removes the need for physical hardware, democratizing mining and making it feasible for a wider audience.</p>
<p>Of the total 4 billion $BTCMTX tokens, 42.5% is set aside for mining, 7.5% for staking, and a dedicated chunk for community initiatives.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/333129/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix stake-to-mine" /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper</u></a> also highlights the importance of user experience. The platform offers an intuitive dashboard, granting users a clear perspective on their mining statistics, such as hashing power, mining credit metrics, and potential daily, weekly, or monthly returns. Whether on desktop or mobile, users can smoothly oversee their mining activity.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s tokenized system offers tangible mining credits for staked tokens, securing against potential cloud mining scams. </p>
<p>Users also enjoy the flexibility of unstaking and liquidating their tokens per market conditions.

<h3><strong>3. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Emerging Community-focused Meme Crypto With Upside Potential</strong></h3>
<p>The next spot on our list belongs to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a>, a meme coin that has been all the rage in recent months.</p>
<p>Despite multiple factors at play, WSM’s compelling branding and widespread support stand out as the most influential reasons behind this explosive start.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes presale recently ended on a high note, raising in excess of $25 million. Following its 26 September OKX listing, the coin&#8217;s value rose by a staggering 275% in a short span of four days.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/313300/image1-28.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes meme" /></figure>
<p>Wall Street Memes is the latest project from a crypto developer team known for their successful 2021 NFT launch. </p>
<p>Under the name Wall St Bulls, their 10,000 non-fungible tokens collection caused a sensation in the crypto investment market. This Ethereum-based line was all gone within half an hour, gaining worldwide recognition.</p>
<p>This success encouraged the team to launch its flagship meme coin in 2023. The mission fueling this project is similar to Wall St Bulls, based on what the WSM<a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u> whitepaper</u></a> explains. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s meant to empower retail investors to turn the extraordinary meme popularity into profit.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/316287/wall-street-memes-tokenomics.jpg" alt="WSM tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>Judging by the network’s following, this objective resonated with over a million people across multiple networks. Even Elon Musk, a proponent of meme coins like Dogecoin, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954"><u>tweeted about it</u></a>. </p>
<p>However, social media followers and Musk’s involvement aren’t the only driving forces behind WSM’s popularity. Wall Street Memes&#8217; latest airdrop also played a role in making it the most profitable crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>The network announced a $50,000 token giveaway shortly after its presale launch. According to the rules, five winners will be awarded equal amounts of tokens by the end of the year. </p>
<p>Interested investors should follow WSM’s official <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram </u></a>and other social media accounts and purchase its coins.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Launchpad XYZ &#8211; Web3 Ecosystem Available to buy for Presale </strong></h3>
<p>The next cryptocurrency with potential is $LPX, the native token of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/">Launchpad XYZ</a>. This cryptocurrency platform acts as a portal for entering and accessing other Web3 ecosystems. </p>
<p>The $LPX token can be used to get guaranteed access to different presales, discounts on crypto exchanges, and more, and has so far raised more than $1 million in its presale.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/276587/launchpad-img.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ web3 project" /></figure>
<p>On Launchpad XYZ, users can get their own Web3 wallet. Users must only provide their email address or phone number to set up the wallet. On the wallet, one can swap tokens, get self-custody of assets and interact with other decentralized applications (DApps).</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ will also give access to a decentralized exchange where you can access hundreds of crypto pairs. You can also access limited perpetual contracts and hold $LPX to get discounts on trading fees. </p>
<p>Through this Web3 portal, users can get access to Web3 presales as well. By staking a minimum monthly average of 10,000 $LPX, you get guaranteed access to certain presale tokens. After purchasing, the tokens will appear on your Launchpad XYZ wallets. </p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ also allows users to get rewarded through a trading edge game. Learn and test out trading strategies, and earn $LPX tokens as rewards on the ecosystem. Other use cases of $LPX include purchasing fractionalized real estate and art. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/276588/launchpad-web3.jpg" alt="Launchpad XYZ crypto project" /></figure>
<p>From a total supply of 1 billion, 250 million tokens have been allocated equally across ten rounds. Currently, $LPX is priced at only $0.0445 per token. By the final presale round, the price will increase to $0.07 per token.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Scorpion Casino &#8211; Crypto Casino with Redistribution Model for Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>In recent years, the crypto casino market has undergone remarkable growth, witnessing the swift emergence of several projects that gained immense popularity in a short period. However, there is a new project and platform on the horizon set to revolutionize this specific market.</p>
<p><a href="https://presale.scorpion.casino/?utm_source=CN" rel="nofollow"><u>Scorpion Casino</u></a> leads the way as the pioneering betting platform driving the industry&#8217;s evolution. Its core objective is to deliver a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience to users while ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to earn. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/276987/scorp-buy-now.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino SCORP token" /></figure>
<p>With the global online betting platform being valued at an astonishing $530.2 billion, Scorpion Casino stands poised to make a substantial impact and capture a significant market share. Additionally, the projected growth of the online betting market to $145.6 billion by 2030 further highlights its significance and potential.</p>
<p>Scorpion Casino currently consists of three key features: the Scorpion Casino platform, the affiliate system, and the SCORP token. The platform itself operates as a licensed sports betting and casino platform based on cryptocurrency. In contrast, the affiliate system serves as a referral and reward mechanism, while the SCORP token functions as a governance and reward token for users.</p>
<p>Scorpion Casino offers users a comprehensive selection of gaming options, boasting an extensive library of over 200 casino games and 160 live games. These games are fully licensed and adhere to stringent fairness standards. Among the available games, players can enjoy popular choices such as slots, blackjack, roulette, poker, and immersive live casino experiences. Additionally, the platform has established partnerships with renowned providers including Evolution, NetEnt, Play N Go, Novomatic, EGT, and AMATIC. Sports enthusiasts can also indulge in diverse sports betting options covering football, tennis, American football, horse racing, basketball, golf, boxing, and MMA.</p>
<p>All of this will allow the project to break down the barriers in the casino industry. Players can get additional benefits by joining the Elite Scorpion Members Club, which grants features like VIP service, cashback, extra staking rewards, and extra SCORP tokens.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/276988/scorpion-license.jpg" alt="Scorpion Casino Curacao license" /></figure>
<p>The SCORP token assumes a pivotal role within the ecosystem, providing users with four key benefits. First and foremost, it serves as the exclusive payment method within the ecosystem. Additionally, token holders have the opportunity to generate passive income. The token also unlocks weekly bonuses and free games for users and plays an integral part in the affiliate system.</p>
<p>As for the token supply, the SCORP token has a total of 1 billion in circulation. Out of this supply, 280 million SCORP tokens have been allocated for the presale, while 300 million tokens have been earmarked for affiliate rewards.</p>
<p>The Scorpion Casino team has devised a roadmap detailing their upcoming plans. These plans encompass live affiliate events, partnerships, marketing campaigns, and collaborations. Their focus for the latter half of the year revolves around scaling the platform to achieve substantial growth and expansion.</p>

<h3><strong>6. yPredict &#8211; Cryptocurrency Analytics Platform with Ongoing Presale</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> is a cryptocurrency analytics platform where members can access data-driven insights on the cryptocurrency markets. </p>
<p>On the artificial intelligence and machine learning-powered platform, users can purchase monthly subscriptions to predictive models with $YPRED, the native token. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/316289/ypredict-chart.jpg" alt="yPredict crypto AI project" /></figure>
<p>The models are offered on a financial marketplace and have been generated by financial quants and AI experts. Each model is only put in the financial marketplace after being verified by the yPredict DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). </p>
<p>The models offer AI-based trading signals, which predict the potential movement of certain digital assets. The platform also leverages AI tools such as sentiment analysis to analyze the potential trajectory of certain cryptocurrencies. Another tool used is a patent pending chart recognition algorithm, which determines whether certain cryptos are likely to be bullish or bearish. </p>
<p>The $YPRED token also offers multiple use cases on the ecosystem. Users can leverage their tokens to take part in a play-to-earn ecosystem. In this ecosystem, users can make directional bets on the future of the crypto markets. The top performers are rewarded with $YPRED tokens. </p>
<p>Users can also increase their knowledge of the cryptocurrency markets by learning through yPredict’s Learn2Earn ecosystem. Members can take assessments and quizzes and earn more $YPRED tokens for successfully passing the tests. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/276584/ypredict-home.jpg" alt="yPredict AI crypto research" /></figure>
<p>There is also a 7% tax on selling the token, which may stop users from frequently buying and dumping the token. From the funds collected, 1% of the tax is sent towards liquidity, 1% for development, 3% for marketing, and 2% for research. </p>
<p>Since the start of the presale, yPredict has raised more than $2.75 million. Currently, the token is priced at $0.09 but will jump to $0.12 per token by the final presale round.

<h3><strong>7. DeeLance (DLANCE) &#8211; Profitable Utility Token Bringing Freelancing Ecosystem to Web3</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/deelance/">DeeLance</a> is a Web3 project that aims to remove the bottlenecks of the current freelancing space and make it more worthwhile for the freelancers. </p>
<p>The project attacks the centralization aspects prevalent across many platforms like the UpWork and Fiverr, where freelancers often don&#8217;t get paid or sometimes are deemed unskilled &#8211; losing their account as a result. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/268243/deelance.jpg" alt="DeeLance metaverse freelancer project" /></figure>
<p>With DeeLance, freelancers and companies can come together on a platform with a decentralized ownership. Every freelancer who posts their work on the platform will do so in the form of NFTs. Tokenizing their works, freelancers will be able to add their signatures to their works via smart contracts, allowing them to receive payment instantly once their work is bought by the clients. </p>
<p>Companies will be able to advertise their requirements in a better way using DeeLance tools that offer various features allowing the job descriptions to be precise, and reaching out to the talent that is capable of handling it. </p>
<p>That focus on an NFT marketplace is why DeeLance can thrive. Add to that, there is a DeeLance metaverse under construction. This virtual world will be divided into ownable plots and infrastructures that people can own to conduct business meetings. The metaverse will also become a venue for business meetings, and interviews. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/276585/deelance-fee-comparison.jpg" alt="DeeLance features" /></figure>
<p>The entire DeeLance ecosystem is powered by DLANCE tokens. It is an ERC-20 asset that is used to access the facilities of the DeeLance Web3 freelancing portal, which gives the asset more utility than other standard cryptos. </p>
<p>The upside potential of this project is high, which is why people have already started to rally around it during the presale. The presale has raised over $1.5 million at press time.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Tamadoge (TAMA) &#8211; NFT Game Offering Rewards and 18x Returns</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/">Tamadoge</a> might initially appear to be another meme coin. But it separates itself from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by offering players in-game rewards and entertainment. Most investors agree that Dogecoin has little utility, but Tamadoge enables players to climb the leaderboard by raising digital pets.</p>
<p>Players that nurture their pets into adulthood the fastest and then win battles receive TAMA tokens. Grooming pets involves walking, feeding and exercising them. Players can also breed pets to earn rewards.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/225492/tama-m.jpg" alt="Tamadoge ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>Tamadoge proved it would be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos to buy</a> during its crypto presale. It sold out in under two months and was scheduled to last until Q2 2022. The presale raised $19 million, but the initial coin offering (ICO) was even more spectacular.</p>
<p>TAMA was listed on OKX on 27 September 2022. Early investors bought TAMA coins for $0.01 during the presale, then watched the coin surge to $0.19 during the ICO </p>
<p>That&#8217;s 18x returns for investors during a crypto winter. </p>
<p>The other way Tamadoge distinguishes itself from most meme coins is with its deflationary status. Only 2 billion coins are in circulation, and that will decrease over time with the 5% token burn of transaction fees in the pet store. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/225493/tama-nft.jpg" alt="Tamadoge NFTs" /></figure>
<p>Tamadoge NFTs have now also been released on OpenSea, including common, rare and ultra rare collections.</p>
<p>Other developments coming to the platform are more P2E Arcade games &#8211; so far half a dozen have been released &#8211; and an augmented reality (AR) app. The app will make the interaction between players and pets more realistic. </p>
<p>Stay in touch with this project&#8217;s latest developments by subscribing to the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram channel.</a></p>

<h3><strong>9. Swords of Blood (SWDTKN) &#8211; Next Big Crypto Game with High Profit Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Swords of Blood is a play-to-earn MMORPG project that combines the fun gameplay fundamentals of a hack-and-slash game with Web 3 to give players not only a great game with a deep lore, but also a way to earn a profit in crypto from gaming. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/268247/swords-of-blood.jpg" alt="Swords of Blood presale" /></figure>
<p>Players get to choose their class in this RPG game before getting started &#8211; battle mage, warrior, rogue, or a mix of these classes before venturing deep into creative dungeons and locations full of enemies where slaying the enemies and solving puzzles comes with a dynamic collection of loot that will make your player character even more powerful. </p>
<p>Blockchain games have been criticized for not being fun to play. Swords of Blood, being an extension of a Web 2 game that was launched in 2019, is aiming to change that thanks to its experience.</p>
<p>Powering this P2E game is the $SWDTKN token, which has multiple utilities, including staking and the ability to buy upgrades from the in-game marketplace. Its also on presale currently, allowing early investors another way to profit. Click the link below to learn more about this GameFi asset. </p>

<h3><strong>10. Solana (SOL) &#8211; Efficient Ecosystem Facilitating Large-Volume Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>Using the Solana network offers developers and peer-to-peer users several advantages. This network is ideal for developers wanting a platform to build scalable applications. Solana enables users to send funds globally for mere pennies.</p>
<p>Besides the low costs, Solana provides a platform that&#8217;s extremely efficient. Large volumes of transactions can be processed in seconds. Currently, Solana&#8217;s network processes around 4,000 transactions per second. But the platform is working on upgrading its system to process 65,000 transactions per second.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/225532/solan-e.jpg" alt="Solana price chart" /></figure>
<p>Users can also take advantage of safe transacting because Solana&#8217;s network is spread over thousands of independent nodes. Besides providing a reliable and effective ecosystem, Solana boasts a highly lucrative coin.</p>
<p>SOL is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm">cryptos to watch</a> because it has provided investors with massive returns. That&#8217;s because many investors recognized the utility the project offers and the real-world problems it solves.</p>
<p>Investors who bought SOL in January 2021 watched the coin go on an epic bull run, eventually providing more than 20,000% returns by November of that year.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Cardano (ADA) &#8211; Top Proof of Stake Platform Earning Investors High Profits</strong></h3>
<p>Cardano&#8217;s proof of stake platform was designed to be flexible and scalable for facilitating smart contracts. Developers use Cardano to build games, decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>By using the proof of stake consensus, Cardano rewards the highest number of ADA tokens to validators depending on their investment in the pool and the length of time that the coins were locked in.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/225779/cardano-etoro.jpg" alt="Cardano price chart" /></figure>
<p>The network enables developers to design native coins that operate on the same architecture as the ADA coin. These native tokens are regarded as superior to other coins on the blockchain because they&#8217;re more secure and have lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>ADA Is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> to go on an epic bull run. It&#8217;s proven that twice in the last five years. At the end of 2017, Cardano&#8217;s price pump resulted in investors bagging returns of more than 5,000%. The most recent bull run was at the end of 2020. The coin surged more than 2,000% by September 2021.</p>
<h3><strong>12. Ethereum (ETH) &#8211; Second Biggest Coin Facilitating Smart Contracts</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum hosts thousand of dApps and is a leading smart contract provider. Its smart contract functionality enables a project&#8217;s stakeholders to communicate with each other without the control or interference of a central authority.</p>
<p>Ethereum used the proof work consensus, requiring miners to verify transactions. But the network changed to a proof of stake platform during the infamous Ethereum Merge. The motivation behind the move was to reduce Ethereum&#8217;s carbon footprint and make the entire ecosystem more environmentally friendly.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/225797/ethereum-etor.jpg" alt="Ethereum price chart" /></figure>
<p>Switching to the new consensus has enabled stakers to earn rewards by staking ETH. Other upcoming developments to Ethereum&#8217;s network are lower transaction fees and more efficient transactions. </p>
<p>Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. It usually follows Bitcoin during its bull run, and it did just that at the end of 2020. Investors who bought ETH in September 2020 received returns of just over 1,400% by November 2021.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Dogecoin (DOGE) &#8211; Ultimate Meme Coin Receiving Celebrity Endorsements</strong></h3>
<p>Many investors regard Dogecoin to be the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">best meme coin</a> because of the returns provided. Although Dogecoin&#8217;s bull run was based purely on speculation since the coin doesn&#8217;t have much utility, it has made an impact on the crypto community.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s listed on the major exchanges and was the talk of the town during the meme coin era. A key reason the coin&#8217;s price surged was due to celebrity endorsements, especially by Elon Musk. Dogecoin became even more popular once it was listed on Robinhood and Tesla announced it would accept it as a payment method.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/225810/doge-etoro.jpg" alt="Dogecoin to USD price chart" /></figure>
<p>Numerous meme coins were developed as a result of Dogecoin&#8217;s popularity. Many tried to feed off its hype by claiming to be a better alternative but no meme coin project emulated Dogecoin&#8217;s returns. </p>
<p>The coin surged at the end of 2017 and pumped to 2,000% by the beginning of 2018. But that bull run paled in comparison to its latest price pump. The coin surged again at the end of 2020, providing investors with more than 20,000% returns by May 2021.</p>
<h3><strong>14. Bitcoin &#8211; Pioneering Crypto Providing Rewards for the Longest Duration</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency and is the highest profit crypto since it&#8217;s been on the blockchain the longest. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">long term crypto</a> that has become more popular throughout the years, and it has increased its returns to investors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization and has been on several bull runs. Bitcoin&#8217;s 2013 bull run provided investors with more than 1,000% returns. At the time, it was unheard of for a financial asset to yield such high returns in a short period. And Bitcoin was only one of the few cryptos to have a bull run that year. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89927/225835/bitc-etoro.jpg" alt="Bitcoin price chart" /></figure>
<p>Not only did Bitcoin&#8217;s 2017 bull run offer massive returns again, but it was the catalyst for many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> to surge as well. Many investors entered the crypto market in 2017 because of the attention that Bitcoin&#8217;s bull run received.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was the leading crypto during the most recent bull run. During the 2020 global lockdowns, asset prices plummeted, and many investors lost hope in receiving returns in the near future. </p>
<p>Bitcoin didn&#8217;t need long to recover, as it began making higher lows towards the end of the year and eventually led the 2021 crypto bull, reaching its all-time high of $69,000 in November that year. With that said many investors are now asking themselves <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-much-to-invest-in-bitcoin.htm">how much should I invest in Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Find Highly Profitable Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The highest profit cryptocurrency usually had several bull runs. Investors can analyze the charts of assets to gauge their price action. It’s common for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-volatile-cryptos.htm">most volatile cryptos</a> to provide the highest profits.</p>
<p>Investors can also use several methods to open buy positions as cryptos are surging.</p>
<h3><strong>Signals</strong></h3>
<p>Numerous <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">crypto signals groups</a> send alerts to subscribers about cryptocurrencies on the move. The alerts inform investors about the entry price and the potential profit-taking level.</p>
<p>Traders can also customize their own settings in TradingView. This charting platform enables traders to sort assets according to the percentage change in daily movement. Cryptos with the highest price movements appear at the top and in green, making it easy for traders to notice.</p>
<h3><strong>CoinMarketCap</strong></h3>
<p>CoinMarketCap tracks the listings and price movements of cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. It also ranks cryptos according to their market capitalization. The top 10 cryptocurrencies on the list captured the biggest share of the market and have done so because investors have demanded those coins.</p>
<p>Dogecoin wasn’t one of the top 10 cryptos before its latest bull run, but investors buying the coin during its hype resulted in it becoming one of the biggest coins on the market.</p>
<h3><strong>Presales</strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain projects that had a successful <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presales</a> are usually then also profitable during the ICO. The Bitcoin ETF Token presale quickly reached the the $500,000 mark at press time &#8211; showing a high level of early investor demand.</p>
<h2><strong>Most Profitable Time to Buy Crypto</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Buying low and selling high is the most profitable investment strategy. The part of that equation investors struggle with the most is finding the bottom. Many investors believe that ICO prices are the bottom, but lower prices are found during presales.</p>
<p>Only a small group of investors know about each project’s crypto presale. During the ICO is when the rest of the market finds out about it. But discounted prices are available at the onset of the project, especially during the beta presale.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Before knowing how to trade cryptocurrency for profit, investors need to identify volatile assets. Those assets are likely to provide the highest profits for investors. Although the most profitable cryptocurrency to buy are usually one of the top 15 coins by market capitalization, we found a few that are currently in presale.</p>
<p>One of the most profitable cryptocurrencies right now is Bitcoin ETF Token. Since the presale started, Bitcoin ETF Token has already raised over $500,000 in less than two weeks. Buyers can grab the $BTCETF tokens for only $0.0052 at press time.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>Fight Out is an upcoming move to earn platform that rewards users for pursuing an active and healthy lifestyle. While not the first of its kind, the Fight Out crypto project aims to be an M2E platform with a difference with many distinguishing features that benefit investors.</p>
<p>Our review team scrutinized Fight Out to determine the mechanics of its ecosystem, the project&#8217;s tokenomics, details of its ongoing token presale, and future roadmap. For interested investors, also included is a step-by-step guide on how to buy Fight Out crypto tokens.</p>
<h2>Fight Out Crypto: What is it?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/fightout">Fight Out</a> is a move to earn platform that has revolutionized workouts by developing a fitness platform using Web 3.0 technology. </p>
<p>Apart from creating an ecosystem that enables fitness fanatics to lead an active lifestyle, Fight Out provides monetary rewards to users in the form of digital currencies, which can be exchanged for fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Instead of developing just another M2E platform, Fight Out has gamified this ecosystem to make fitness more interactive, entertaining and rewarding. This ecosystem has lowered the barriers of entry by simplifying the use of Web 3.0 technology and not requiring users to invest in expensive <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Fight Out has accommodated everybody who wants to reach their fitness goals by developing a platform that&#8217;s not cost-prohibitive and enables users to track their progress.</p>
<p>As a user progresses on their fitness journey, their soulbound avatar directly benefits by having the progress transferred onto it.</p>
<p>The training and rewards will be facilitated via the Fight Out mobile app. But the ecosystem will spread to real-world gyms, enabling users of the platform to attend live classes and make use of the facilities in key cities around the world.</p>

</div>
<h2>Fight Out Mechanics</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Fight Out is a platform that enables users to get a complete physical and mental workout. It enables users to improve their strength, cardio, muscle endurance, mental fortitude and technique.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/248904/mental-fort.jpg" alt="Fight Out use features" /></figure>
<p>Although Fight Out specializes in wellness-rounded fitness programs, users can customize workouts to focus on their specialty and specific muscle groups.</p>
<p>The first step is to create an account with an e-mail address and download the app. Subscriptions are available in-app, and users will receive 25% off if subscribing with the native token, $FGHT. </p>
<p>The next step is for users to set their fitness goals, background, the equipment at their disposal and desired workout types. The app also enables users to track their nutrition and sleep for accountability.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/248910/fight-out-app.jpg" alt="Fight Out mobile app" /></figure>
<p>The workout builder is perfect for solo users seeking a personalized routine. The app generates exercises based on the user&#8217;s fitness level and provides video tutorials to ensure users practice good form. The videos also highlight newbie mistakes and provide advanced tips.</p>
<p>A feature for on-demand workout classes via the app or live sessions at Fight Out gyms is available. The workouts consist of yoga, meditation, boxing and strength and conditioning.</p>
<p>Elite-level boxing coaches will run a technique-focused course to introduce users to the fundamentals of boxing.</p>
<p>Leaderboards stats and challenges are shown to build a culture of competition, thereby motivating each user to excel.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>The key difference between Fight Out and and most M2E platforms is that it doesn&#8217;t focus on a single metric for activity. Not only does it track steps, but it also follows a user&#8217;s movements during workout class participation, bodyweight exercises and weight exercises.</p>
<p>Besides workouts, the in-app <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-move-to-earn-crypto.htm">move to earn crypto,</a> REPS, is also rewarded to users who grow the community and earn badges.</p>
<p>This reward mechanism motivates Web 2.0 fitness users to switch to a Web 3.0 ecosystem.  </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/248928/fo-reward.jpg" alt="Fight Out rewards" /></figure>
<p>Fight Out uses smart technology to track movement and key effort indicators to ensure data points feed into a reward algorithm. </p>
<p>Rewards are distributed into different categories such as cardio, wellness and muscle strength. To obtain the optimal rewards, users should engage in all-around growth.</p>
<p>After receiving REPS, users can redeem them in several ways. One way is to redeem them in the Fight Out store, which is stocked with merchandise such as shoes, sweaters and fighting gear. Also available in the store are supplements and training equipment.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/243487/fighout-avatar.jpg" alt="Fight Out virtual avatar" /></figure>
<p>The other option is to redeem REPS for discounts on app subscriptions and remote consultations with trainers.</p>
<p>Users who want to accumulate more REPS can intensify their workouts to receive higher rewards or they can be bought with Fight Out tokens.</p>
<p>Fight Out also enables users to redeem the REPS on their NFT avatars. Cosmetics can be added to the avatars such as fashion accessories, hairstyles and tattoos to make them unique.</p>

</div>
<h2>What&#8217;s Special About Fight Out?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Unlike most M2E crypto platforms that track only a user&#8217;s steps, Fight Out ensures that the smart technology also includes movement. That&#8217;s particularly useful for users wanting to maximize rewards if they train with weights.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/248947/fight-gyms.jpg" alt="Fight Out gymes" /></figure>
<p>Using Fight Out enables users to enjoy a gamified experienced via their avatar. The strength that a user develop is transferred to the avatar, which enters the metaverse once its strength is sufficient.</p>
<p>In the metaverse, the avatar competes against other players to win fights and tournaments. That provides users with more opportunities to earn reward tokens.</p>
<p>Fight Out enables users to challenge AI-powered pro fighters or attend AI-powered exhibitions and championships. </p>
<p>The gyms are a key feature that distinguishes Fight Out from similar platforms. Besides the app, this ecosystem will soon cater to users who want to use facilities and personal training in person. The Fight Out gym will be located in key metropolitan areas. </p>
<p>The gyms will contain a health bar stocked with nutritious meals, smoothies and snacks. Health bars will be available through VIP rewards for stakers. A content studio layout in the gym enables personal trainers to interact with users and offer classes remotely.</p>
<p>Fight Out has signed professional fighters and top-tier coaches to serve as ambassadors of the brand.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/248950/amb-fo.jpg" alt="Fight Out ambassadors" /></figure>
<p>The MMA fighters, boxers and fitness influencers will provide more exposure to the brand by wearing Fight Out merchandise and promoting it at exclusive functions.</p>
<p>Elite platform users will have access to masterclass-style content developed by these professionals to provide advanced training workouts that will help users expedite their progress.</p>
<h2>Is Fight Out Token a Worthwhile Investment?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors need solid reasons to invest in a crypto project, and the Fight Out token has proven to be a utility coin.</p>
<h3>Bonus Tokens</h3>
<p>The Fight Out <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a> contains bonus tokens that investors will be entitled to if they participate in the early-round fundraising. During the first stage of the presale, Fight Out offers bonus tokens based on the initial investment and vesting period selected.</p>
<p>An investment of $500 will yield a 10% bonus, and an additional 10% will be granted for selecting the 6-month vesting period. </p>
<p>Investors who want to maximize the rewards can receive a 50% bonus. That will require a $50,000 investment and a 24-month vesting period.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/86516/248191/fght-50pc.jpg" alt="FGHT bonus" /></figure>
<p>The bonus tokens will be available only during the first stage of the presale. Investors who want to claim the bonus should act now as the bonus is removed once the $5 million hard cap is reached.   </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Fight Out had already raised more than $2.8 million.</p>
<h3>Giveaway</h3>
<p>To celebrate the presale launch, Fight Out is hosting a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-giveaways.htm">crypto giveaway</a>. This is an opportunity for early investors to receive more Fight Out cryptocurrency. One lucky investor will win $250,000 of Fight Out crypto tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/248962/giveaw-fo.jpg" alt="Fight Out giveaway" /><br />Only 202 days remain for investors to be part of the giveaway. To be eligible for the giveaway, investors need to own at least $250 of Fight Out crypto tokens on the day of the draw.</p>
<p>Multiple entries are granted to investors who perform social media tasks such as retweeting Fight Out on Twitter and joining the <a href="https://t.me/FightOutOfficial">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>Investors can find out more information about Fight Out and $FGHT by reading the <a href="https://whitepaper.fightout.com/">whitepaper.</a></p>
<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<p>A stagnant project is bound to be left behind. That&#8217;s one of the reasons that Fight Out is constantly developing. Besides the gyms it&#8217;s working on opening, Fight Out will also offer a co-working space to let members destress and increase their productivity.</p>
<p>More ambassadors will be added to the roster, which will provide the project with more exposure. Exercises will be enhanced with the First Steps boxing course.</p>

<h2>Who is Behind Fight Out?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Knowing who is operating the project ensures investors that this ecosystem is legitimate. The Fight Out team is fully doxxed for transparency with their professional background detailed on LinkedIn.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/252292/screenshot-2023-01-23-at-11-26-16.jpg" alt="Fight Out team" /></figure>
<p>The project&#8217;s CEO for example is Carl Jones. Marco Raposo is the product owner, and Amadeus Rennalls is responsible for UI/UX design. Other members of the team include David Ryan is the community manager.</p>
<p>Acting as the brand&#8217;s ambassadors are Amanda Ribas (MMA fighter), Tremayne Dortch (fitness influencer), Savannah Marshall (professional boxer) and Taila Santos (MMA fighter).</p>
<p>Certik has performed a security assessment audit on Fight Out, and it verified it on 18 December 2022.</p>
<h2>Fight Out&#8217;s Future Plans</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In Q1 2023, Fight Out presale will conclude. Fight Out plans to acquire its first gym during this period. Another important launch will be regarding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm">crypto app</a>. At the beginning of 2023, app testing will take place. </p>
<p>Limited edition fighter NFTs will be launched and staking for Fight Out crypto tokens, which will enable investors to earn a passive income by locking up their coins.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/249002/1app-fo.jpg" alt="Fight Out roadmap" /></figure>
<p>After the testing, the app should be launched in Q2. $FGHT tokens will be destined for centralized exchanges. That is when the majority of the market will become acquainted with this project. The first pro-fighter workouts will be launched. </p>
<p>Heading into Q3 2023, investors can expect the launch of the First Steps boxing course. There will also be more on-demand workouts and additional in-app social features.</p>
<p>Looking at Q4 and beyond, Fight Out plans to launch its first gym. Other planned launches include PVP contests, Fight Out metaverse, in-app marketplace and challenges for REPS.</p>
<h2>Fight Out&#8217;s Presale </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors who want to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-fightout-token.htm">buy $FGHT tokens</a> are likely to find them at the lowest price during the presale. The first stage of the presale is currently underway and offers the tokens at $0.0166.</p>
<p>The presale ends on 31 March, and $FGHT tokens are scheduled to be listed on centralized exchanges on 4 April 2023. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/248960/10-jan-fo.jpg" alt="Fight Out token presale" /></figure>
<p>The Fight Out website states that $FGHT tokens will be listed on exchanges at $0.0333. Investors who buy $FGHT tokens during the first stage will be up by 100% by the time the presale ends.</p>
<p>Investors may also be entitled to bonus tokens during the first stage of the presale if they meet the prerequisites. </p>
<p>Fight Out has a capped supply of 10 billion tokens. It has allocated 30% to the presale and 15% of the tokens will be given in rewards to early investors. Another 50% will be locked away as part of the vesting over 5 years.</p>
<p>Only 5% of the tokens are allocated to exchange liquidity. That means investors have more access to the Fight Out crypto tokens during the presale than on exchanges.</p>
<h2>How to Invest in Fight Out</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To make investing in $FGHT tokens simpler, we&#8217;ve included a step-by-step guide.</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Set Up a Wallet</h3>
<p>The first step requires investors to download a wallet to store their cryptocurrencies. This wallet will be connected to the presale platform to complete the buying of $FGHT tokens.</p>
<p>The two most popular choices are MetaMask and Trust Wallet. MetaMask is usually the one recommended because it&#8217;s available on iOS and Android. It&#8217;s also possible to down it to a Chrome desktop browser.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/249027/wmeta.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /></figure>
<p>Download the wallet by visiting the <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask website</a>, then click the &#8216;Download&#8217; icon and select the appropriate device to download the wallet to.</p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Connect the Wallet</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/fightout/en">Visit the Fight Out website</a> and click &#8216;Connect wallet.&#8217; </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/100677/249028/f-fo.jpg" alt="FGHT token presale" /></figure>
<p>The next popup window will prompt you to select the appropriate <a href="https://www.business2community.com/cryptocurrency/wallets?__cf_chl_rt_tk=VqiBWoqKohUeD0Pq1oxXqRqVpu8ge47LkBBJN3Y08UQ-1673366382-0-gaNycGzNDtE">crypto wallet</a> provider. </p>
<p>Note that you will never be asked for your seed phrase &#8211; if you are, you have landed on a fake site impersonating a crypto project. Scammers often even pay for PPC ads for their fake domain to appear in Google search results.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Step-2-image-select-the-wallet-635x600.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Choose a Payment Option</h3>
<p>Investors will need to hold either Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT) in a crypto wallet because one of these coins will be exchanged for $FGHT tokens. Choose a reliable exchange to buy ETH or USDT.</p>
<p>Fight Out has partnered with Transak, which has provided an on-ramp facility that allows investors to buy Ethereum with a card from the website. Ensure that you have bought enough Ethereum to cover the gas fees.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-3new-569x600.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Two options are available after you have Ethereum in your crypto wallet. Investors can buy $FGHT tokens with Ethereum or USDT. Select the appropriate option and then complete the transaction by filling in the details of the purchase, which is the next step.</p>
<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Buy $FGHT tokens</h3>
<p>Input the amount of Ethereum or USDT to exchange for $FGHT tokens.</p>
<p>The amount of $FGHT tokens that the investors will receive will be shown. Investors also have the option of choosing bonus tokens. Once the bonus option is selected, the system will automatically generate the vesting period as well.</p>
<p>Click &#8220;Buy Now&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Claim the Tokens</h3>
<p>The wallet provider will prompt the investor to authorize the transaction so that the transaction is finalized. </p>
<p>The tokens will only be available after the presale ends. Revisit the website and click &#8220;Claim Tokens&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Fight Out has developed its M2E platform to ensure users are rewarded for movements and steps. It has also gamified workouts, providing users with entertainment and more opportunities to earn reward tokens.</p>
<p>Another way that Fight Out has distinguished itself from similar platforms is by striving to open real-world gyms. Once launched, users can attend in person and use the gym&#8217;s facilities.</p>
<p>Fight Out&#8217;s roadmap contains a lot of developments for the ecosystem, which should make the $FGHT token more useful. REPS rewards received can be exchanged for items in the Fight Out store and even to receive a discount on the app&#8217;s subscription.</p>
<p>By signing professional athletes and coaches to be the brand&#8217;s ambassadors, Fight Out aims to provide the ecosystem with more exposure.</p>
<p>The first stage of Fight Out&#8217;s presale enables investors to claim bonus tokens. The maximum bonus investors can claim is 50%, which will require a vesting period of 24 months.</p>
<p>$FGHT is available at $0.0166 during the first stage but will be listed on exchanges at $0.0333, according to the Fight Out website.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>
<p>Investors value assets that solve real-world problems. Many blockchain projects are based on pure speculation and don&#8217;t offer any utility.

<h2><strong>Reviewing the Top Utility NFTs</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Let&#8217;s get into the detailed reviews of the top utility NFTs.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Tamadoge &#8211; Exciting Utility NFT Project with P2E Game and Meme Coin</strong></h3>
<p>One of the key reasons that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/tamadoge">Tamadoge</a> is a utility NFT is that it offers investors rewards, with investors using the platform to receive TAMA tokens for nurturing their digital pets &#8211; built in the style of 90s craze Tamagotchi.</p>
<p>Consequently, TAMA is already one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-utility-tokens.htm">best utility tokens</a> in 2023 and already saw a near 2,000% pump from its presale price with more gains expected in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/234208/tama-nfts.jpg" alt="Tamadoge NFT" /></figure>
<p>Investors buy NFTs to exercise, feed and breed digital pets — each possesses certain strengths and weaknesses. As the pets grow into adults, investors use them to battle other players to collect TAMA tokens,</p>
<p>The leaderboard then ranks investors according to their ability to groom their pets into adulthood.</p>
<p>Further developments to this platform include P2E Arcade games and an augmented reality app. The app will make the interaction between the player and the pet more realistic. </p>
<p>The other good aspect of Tamadoge is its deflationary token. The developers will burn 5% of the transaction fees in the pet store purchases. TAMA&#8217;s supply is capped at 2 billion tokens, which will decrease significantly over time. That will make the coin more difficult to own.</p>
<p>Tamadoge proved to be a successful NFT project from the beginning as its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a> sold out ahead of schedule. It was scheduled to last until the end of Q4 2022, but overwhelming demand sold out the TAMA tokens in less than two months.</p>
<p>The Tamdoge NFT collection has since launched, with 21,000 pets available in three tiers &#8211; Ultra Rare, Rare and Common.</p>
<p>Ultra Rare pets, which have boosted stats in the game. became the top trending collection on OpenSea at launch, with the 100 NFTs raising 250ETH. </p>
<p>They now have a floor price of nearly 6ETH, with only six listed for less than 80ETH, while on the other hand, Common Tamadoge pets can be bought for 0.2ETH each.</p>
<p>Staying up to date with this NFT project&#8217;s latest developments is best achieved via the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram channel</a> (<i>admins will not DM you first</i>).</p>

<h3><strong>2. Lucky Block &#8211; NFT Competition Platform Rewarding Major Prizes</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lucky-block-casino/">Lucky Block</a> began as a platform offering luxury watches and holidays to draw winners but quickly progressed to an NFT competition platform. It&#8217;s upped the stakes by offering main prizes such as a Lamborghini, $1 million in Bitcoin and a home worth $1 million.</p>
<p>To enter draws, investors need to own a Lucky Block NFT. The Platinum Rollers Club NFT is limited to 10,000 NFTs, with some being limited editions. Even if participants don&#8217;t win the major prizes, Lucky Block will continue to provide daily rewards as long as holders have their NFTs in their wallets.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222755/21lucky-block-1.jpg" alt="Lucky Block NFT and crypto coins" /></figure>
<p>NFTs aren&#8217;t the only assets offering investors rewards on Lucky Block. The native token, LBLOCK, surged more than 1,100% when it started trading on PancakeSwap. It&#8217;s proved to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">cryptos with the most upside</a> with its 65x bull run earlier in 2022, and is now undervalued with more exchange listings scheduled in the near future.</p>
<p>To date, LBLOCK has been listed on LBank, Uniswap, MEXC and Gate.io. Lucky Block&#8217;s development of an ERC-20 token, known as LBLOCK V2, has simplified LBLOCK&#8217;s exchange listings. It has enabled day traders to avoid a 12% sales tax, which applies to the BEP-20 V1 token (listed on PancakeSwap).</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222757/lucky-block-v2.jpg" alt="LBlock token features" /></figure>
<p>Another key development with this NFT platform is its token burn. Lucky Block CEO Scott Ryder announced that a monthly 1% token burn would commence on 30 September 2022. The aim of the burn was to increase the token&#8217;s value.</p>

<h3><strong>3. RobotEra &#8211; Newly Released Utility NFT Project Merging NFTs, P2E and the Metaverse</strong></h3>
<p>Fans of established metaverse utility NFT projects like The Sandbox will likely be very interested in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/robotera/">RobotEra (TARO)</a>, an exciting new crypto project developing an advanced suite of tools for building within the in-game virtual world. RobotEra is powered by the TARO governance token, an asset that has been attracting huge attention since its November 2022 launch. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/236163/robotera-homepage-2.jpg" alt="RobotEra token presale page" /></figure>
<p>RobotEra has utilized NFTs on the Ethereum network for the vast majority of its in-game assets. By taking this approach, the project has ensured that in-game items can be easily bought, sold, and traded, a move likely to stimulate the RobotEra economy massively. Plots of land, the digital identity of players, and customizable robot companions all take the form of NFTs.</p>
<p>Another reason why RobotEra&#8217;s collections are considered to be some of the best utility NFTs on the market is the fact that they can be traded without removing any customizations. This will enable players to build detailed structures and entire games within the RobotEra metaverse before either renting or selling the completed build, creating a virtual real estate market. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/236162/robotera-hall.jpg" alt="RobotEra web3 project" /></figure>
<p>One of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-nft-projects.htm">best metaverse projects</a>, RobotEra is split into plots of land known as continents. Within these plots of land, players can build and mine for resources used to craft robot companions that can be sold on the in-built NFT marketplace. Using the project&#8217;s advanced creator tools, it&#8217;s possible to build entire music venues, office spaces, and everything in between. </p>
<p>For investors wishing to learn more about this exciting new utility NFT project, we&#8217;ve included a video from prominent crypto content creator Jacob Crypto Bury.</p>
<p><iframe title="New CRAZY Metaverse Crypto Presale | RobotEra LIVE Now - Next 10x Cryptocurrency" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K3qGtn57RxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>RobotEra is taking a transparency-first approach. As a result, players are given the final say when it comes to deciding which updates will go through. These votes are conducted using the ERC-20 TARO governance token, which boasts a total supply of 1.8 billion. On top of its use as a governance token, TARO can also be staked to receive crypto incentives.   </p>
<p>The TARO token is currently available to investors through a multi-stage crypto presale. The price of TARO during this presale will slowly rise as stages sell out. As such, while it&#8217;s currently possible to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-robotera-tokens.htm">buy TARO</a> for just $0.020, this figure will soon jump to $0.025, before hitting $0.032 during the third stage. Therefore, it could be worth checking out RobotEra early to avoid disappointment. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Silks &#8211; Blockchain Project Mimicking Real-World Horse Racing</strong></h3>
<p>Investors who gain value from real-world horse racing will enjoy <a href="https://www.silks.io/promo?utm_source=CryptoPR">Silks</a>. The team aims to mimic real-world thoroughbred horseracing and did so by tracking the births of horses and relaying them to a digital platform.</p>
<p>Silks also track the progress of each horse to ensure its physical appearance and capabilities are reflected on the platform. A Silks horse is a derivative NFT linked to a real thoroughbred racehorse, which investors can potentially profit from if the horse wins races.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/231828/image1.jpg" alt="Silks Genesis Avatar NFT project" /></figure>
<p>In order to play the game, you need an avatar. The <a href="https://www.silks.io/promo?utm_source=CryptoPR">Silks Avatars</a> sale is taking place now; over 65% of it has already been sold. It has even reached the top 10 sports NFTs on OpenSea. These avatars also come in different rarities and have different traits.</p>
<p>Players can earn rewards from Silks in several ways. One is breeding horses and then grooming them to become racehorses. Once the horse&#8217;s value has increased due to its stature, investors can sell the horse for a profit. Another way to earn is by buying land and transforming it into horse farms. By buying NFTs, investors can add infrastructure to their land and make it more valuable. Investors can sell the land or rent it.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Cocky &#8211; NFT Platform Offering Access to Global Music Events</strong></h3>
<p>NFT utility provides investors value, and <a href="https://www.cockynft.io/?utm_source=CN">Cocky</a> achieves utility by offering exclusive access to real-world global music events. Cocky is an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/upcoming-nft-projects-to-buy-as-an-early-investor.htm">upcoming NFT project</a> for investors wishing to attend music festivals virtually and in person. Live stream access is available to NFT holders unable to attend events in person.</p>
<p>Cocky NFTs have a unique function that enables holders to earn mutations, which are stamps that appear in the NFT&#8217;s background, allowing holders to write their stories and increase the NFTs&#8217; rarity. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/231838/image1.jpg" alt="Cocky crypto project" /></figure>
<p>Registered attendees are automatically entered into a draw to receive exclusive VIP benefits. The platform offers silver, gold and black can lids, each representing the benefits holders receive at Cocky events. </p>
<p>Cocky&#8217;s NFT collection consists of more than 10,000 assets, with 51 skin variations on the cans. A random tier-based system is allocated during minting, enabling investors to unlock various rewards such as accommodation, bar tabs, transport, and exclusive merchandise.</p>
<p>The Black Can is the rarest, and its holder receives VIP benefits indefinitely. Including those mentioned above, some additional benefits for the Black Can NFT holder include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Plus two at all Cocky events</li>
<li>Flights to a luxury resort before each event</li>
<li>Meet and greet the artists </li>
<li>Luxury Accommodation </li>
<li>All-access pass</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cocky events revolve around electronic music and occur in prestigious locations across the globe, meaning you won’t be partying in a farmer’s muddy field. Instead, the events will take place in unconventional locations focusing on the area’s landscape, history, and culture. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/231841/image3.jpg" alt="Cocky unconventional web3 project" /><br /><br />Ticket volume will be limited due to inherent capacity restraints at these locations. If an NFT holder receives a ticket and cannot attend the event, they are free to sell their tickets on the custom-built secondary market. Only Cocky NFT holders can purchase these tickets, adding further to the utility. </p>
<p>The NFT collection is expected to drop in Q4 2022, and the platform aims to make its events bigger and better and eventually compete with festivals like Coachella. </p>
<h3><strong>6. Battle Infinity &#8211; Global Metaverse Gaming Platform</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> is one of the top utility NFTs because it provides investors access to six platforms to earn rewards. Players earn rewards by building up teams and winning competitions, monetizing land and staking their IBAT tokens.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222752/battle-a.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity battle arena" /></figure>
<p>To enter the IBAT Premier League, players need NFT passes. They&#8217;re available in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-marketplaces.htm">NFT Marketplace</a> and are considered assets as they have a value attached. Players can also use their NFTs to stylize their avatars with fashion accessories and unique hairstyles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the Battle Arena that players use virtual-reality headsets to explore the Metaverse and interact with other players in real time. Players can also earn IBAT tokens by staking them. Three ways to stake coins are solo, duo and crates. </p>
<p>Battle Infinity rewards highly active players with IBAT tokens from the global staking pool. Players can exchange their in-game currency for fiat currency on Battle Swap, the platform&#8217;s decentralized exchange.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222751/battle-staking.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity token staking" /></figure>
<p>IBAT proved it was one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best cryptos to buy</a> during its presale, which sold out within 25 days but was scheduled for 90 days. An exchange listing on PancakeSwap followed and resulted in IBAT surging 700% from its presale price.</p>
<p>More developments will follow, and investors can stay in touch by subscribing to the <a href="https://t.me/battleinfinity">Battle Infinity Telegram channel</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>7. Real Estate Investment Club &#8211; Top NFT Real Estate Education Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Real Estate Investment Club (REIC) is another promising <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-nft-projects.htm">NFT project to invest in</a> for individuals wanting to learn real estate and network with like-minded individuals. Owning an REIC NFT entitles holders to memberships providing access to an elite team and a community providing support regarding real estate.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222786/reic.jpg" alt="Real Estate Investment Club project" /></figure>
<p>Members can attend private events globally and receive education about real estate, crypto and blockchain. REIC also offers access to in-house developments and off-market deals globally. Eventually, the platform will integrate into the Metaverse and function as real-world real estate, integrating monetization opportunities into the network.</p>
<p>Apart from having access to the Digital Asset Property Group (DAPG), NFT holders stand a chance of receiving giveaways such as Ethereum mortgage payments, consultations with finance and real estate professionals, and invites to seminars.</p>
<h3><strong>8. NFT Academy &#8211; Popular Platform Providing NFT Creation Tuition</strong></h3>
<p>NFT Academy offers one of the best utility NFTs as it enables investors to fast-track their NFT tuition. Investors can learn how to build, market, grow and sell their own NFT projects.</p>
<p>Elite NFT Academy Pass holders learn how to build tools and an ecosystem to start a Web3.0 agency. The program offered by the NFT Academy provides a step-by-step guide on how to launch an NFT project.</p>
<p>Only 3,000 Elite Passes are available, consisting of multiple 500 token supply drops. This platform equips students with the resources and education to develop a successful NFT project that could be sold for generous amounts.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222798/nft-academy.jpg" alt="NFT Academy web3 project" /></figure>
<p>Investors holding 3x Elite Passes are granted access to the private circle. It&#8217;s ideal for the most committed students eager to learn advanced NFT development and marketing. Some of the perks of joining the Inner Circle are access to unlimited groups and 4+ weekly hours of live training. </p>
<p>Another perk is access to a private chat to ask experts questions. All NFT holders can network with other individuals to swap ideas and potentially form partnerships. NFT Academy offers a job board, enabling its NFT holders to post free job ads to find team members for help with their projects.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Fitness Fiends &#8211; Fitness NFT Project Providing Access to Real-World Gyms</strong></h3>
<p>Considering the fitness industry has drastically grown, it&#8217;s easy to see why projects such as Fitness Fiends are one of the best utility NFTs. The platform consists of 6,666 fitness fiends and provides NFT holders various real-world benefits.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits is free membership to a Fitness Fiends London-based gym. NFT holders unable to train at the gym will receive benefits such as discounts at Fitness Fiends stores, attendance to launch events and Metaverse access to attend fitness classes as a fiend.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222818/fit-fie.jpg" alt="Fitness Fiends web3 project" /></figure>
<p>Each fiend has unique facial expressions and trains on specific equipment &#8211; the fiends are now available to purchase.</p>
<p>Fitness Fiend plans to open multiple gyms in 2023 and beyond, as well as introduce a protein shake.</p>
<h2><strong>What are Utility NFTs?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">best NFTs to buy</a> and hold for the long-term ones that provide real-world utility, also referred to as a use case. An NFT that makes people&#8217;s lives easier and solves real-world problems has utility. It&#8217;s an asset that is likely to grow in value as more people discover its use case and own it.</p>
<p>The utility of NFTs usually determines the asset&#8217;s value. The bigger problem that it solves, the more valuable it is deemed. In some cases, certain NFTs derive their value from offering rewards.</p>
<p>Tamadoge is another utility project, as its ecosystem enables players to earn rewards while entertaining themselves. Although Tamadoge might not solve a real-world problem, it&#8217;s a utility NFT because the TAMA tokens offered to players can be exchanged for fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Assets that don&#8217;t have NFT utility are usually just digital artwork not used for any purpose &#8211; they often struggle to hold their value. During the 2021 NFT hype and retail mania, investors bought .jpeg rocks for seven-figure sums &#8211; today only worth a fraction of that.</p>
<h2><strong>How Can NFTs Offer Utility?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The best utility NFTs offer value to investors in various ways.</p>
<h3><strong>Game Advancement</strong></h3>
<p>Many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-games.htm">crypto games</a> require players to buy NFTs to advance. A game such as Silks enables players to buy racehorses and infrastructure to develop land. If the horse wins races or the land&#8217;s value appreciates due to embellishments, it can be sold for a profit.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88669/222825/144g.jpg" alt="Tamadoge ecosystem" /></figure>
<p>Battle Infinity requires players to own NFT passes to enter the IBAT Premier League, where the main battles take place. To build a team, players need to buy NFTs.</p>
<h3><strong>Capital Appreciation</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm">best long term crypto projects</a> offer assets that appreciate in value. Some are purely speculative, but special edition NFTs and rare ones can increase in value significantly.</p>
<p>Celebrity endorsements and ownership of NFTs have helped numerous projects to increase their assets&#8217; value. One of the most popular NFT projects is Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Its NFTs don&#8217;t really solve any real-world problem or provide special benefits, but some BAYC NFTs have sold for millions of dollars due to celebrity involvement. Therefore some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cheap-nft-projects.htm">cheapest NFT projects</a> could potentially appreciate in value based on social hype. </p>
<h3><strong>Passive Income  </strong></h3>
<p>Some crypto investors <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/earn-passive-income-and-interest-on-your-cryptocurrencies-with-these-four-platforms.htm">earn passive income on cryptocurrencies</a>, and NFT owners can do the same with their assets. One way to earn from digital land is by increasing its value and then selling it. The other way is to rent it.</p>
<p>Renting digital land is a new concept and may be obscure to many investors. But big brands such as Samsung, Adidas and JP Morgan have invested in virtual land to advertise their brands. Brand awareness can be extended to the virtual world since the Metaverse&#8217;s user base is drastically expanding.</p>
<h3><strong>Solving Real-World Problems </strong></h3>
<p>An asset that makes life more convenient by solving problems is valuable. A platform such as the NFT Academy teaches students how to create their own NFT project, which they can sell if successful.   </p>

<h3><strong>Asset Tokenization</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a> enable peer-to-peer transacting.

Although LUNC broke out of the downtrend, buyers didn&#8217;t keep up the momentum at the $0.00036 resistance, and Terra Classic began forming lower lows.</p><p>The bears dominated the price action, and the price failed to break through key resistance levels. LUNC continued its downtrend throughout October. The only good news for the coin is that the downtrend formed a falling wedge, which is a reversal pattern.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/91687/229410/lunc-wedge.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/91687/229410/responsive-images/lunc-wedge___media_library_original_574_507.jpg 574w, https://cimg.co/news/91687/229410/responsive-images/lunc-wedge___media_library_original_300_264.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="574" class="content-img"></figure><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LUNC 4-hour Chart</i><br>As LUNC nears the end of its wedge, it needs to break out of soon for investors to change their bearish sentiment. Another reason for the much-needed breakout is that LUNC is currently on strong support at $0.00024.</p><p>If it breaks through this support, chances are high that a significant price drop is imminent. Considering a breakout to the upside happens, LUNC will face resistance at $0.00032.

The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">wallet provider</a> will launch a compensation portal within 3 working days for victims to apply for a refund.

Today, it reached above $19,500, making some investors excited at the prospect of it breaking out above $20,000.</p><p>After setting its all-time high (ATH) of $69,000 in November 2021 and then losing 73% of its value, Bitcoin has found strong support at the $18,000 price level. It has retested its previous ATH set in 2018 and needs to hold that level if we hope to see higher lows form.</p><p>Even if Bitcoin breaks above $20,000, it doesn&#8217;t mean that we can expect it to keep that momentum and go into a short-term bull run, never mind setting a new ATH.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/91185/228221/1bitcoin-support-1.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/91185/228221/responsive-images/1bitcoin-support-1___media_library_original_812_511.jpg 812w, https://cimg.co/news/91185/228221/responsive-images/1bitcoin-support-1___media_library_original_720_453.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/91185/228221/responsive-images/1bitcoin-support-1___media_library_original_600_377.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/91185/228221/responsive-images/1bitcoin-support-1___media_library_original_300_188.jpg 300w" width="812" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bitcoin Price Chart via TradingView</i></p><p>After crashing to $17,000 in June 2022, Bitcoin proved it&#8217;s one of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-on-the-dip.htm">best crypto to buy during the dip</a> as it recovered to $24,000. Although it made a slight recovery, Bitcoin proved that it&#8217;s in a range after quickly retracing to the $18,000 level. It&#8217;s currently at the bottom of the range, and its slight spike could mean that it&#8217;s headed to the top of the range.</p><h3><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s Potential</strong></h3><p>Whether Bitcoin can set a new ATH in the next two years is debatable, but its probable saving grace can be traced back to its 2017 bull run. When Bitcoin topped out at just over $19,000 in December 2017, something interesting happened before Bitcoin entered its multi-year bear market.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/91185/228236/bitcoi-s.jpg" srcset width class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bitcoin Price Chart History</i></p><p>After setting its then ATH, Bitcoin dropped to $12,000, then had a short-term rally to Fibonacci 0.702 retracement level before continuing the downtrend. Seldom do assets go straight up or down. They have pullbacks along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>And what are we missing from Bitcoin&#8217;s latest crash?&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin hasn&#8217;t done a short-term rally since its massive crash throughout the first half of 2022. Even if crypto bears argue that Bitcoin will make lower lows, it should do a short-term rally before entering a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bear-market-may-last-another-12-to-18-months-says-solana-co-founder.htm">bear market</a> if history replays itself.</p><p>If Bitcoin&#8217;s $18,000 price level is the lowest it will fall in the short term, a rally to the 0.702 Fibonacci retracement means a spike to $53,000. Bitcoin may consolidate for some time before the expected short-term rally.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en"><strong>Buy Bitcoin</strong></a></p><p><i>Crypto assets are highly volatile and unregulated.

First, it had an extremely successful presale, selling out within 25 days of the scheduled 90 days. Then, a PancakeSwap listing cemented IBAT&#8217;s status as one of the best <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm">Metaverse crypto coins</a> by surging more than 700% during its listing.</p><p>Now, Battle Infinity has set staking live. Investors who missed out on the capital appreciation IBAT provided have a chance to earn rewards with IBAT staking.&nbsp;</p><p>Staking requires investors to lock in their coins for a certain period. The benefit is that investors earn rewards while maintaining ownership of the coins during the staking period. It&#8217;s a great way for investors to earn a passive income while also enjoying special benefits as stake investors.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90999/227868/bi-stake.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90999/227868/responsive-images/bi-stake___media_library_original_1150_396.jpg 1150w, https://cimg.co/news/90999/227868/responsive-images/bi-stake___media_library_original_900_309.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90999/227868/responsive-images/bi-stake___media_library_original_720_247.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90999/227868/responsive-images/bi-stake___media_library_original_600_206.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90999/227868/responsive-images/bi-stake___media_library_original_300_103.jpg 300w" width="1150" class="content-img" alt=""></p><p>Battle Infinity enables investors to flexible and time-lock staking. Each offers its own benefits, but the main difference is the rewards that investors can earn.</p><p>With flexible staking, investors can choose the number of coins they wish to lock. In exchange, they will earn a 12% annual percentage yield (APY). Battle Infinity enables investors to re-stake the interest earned on the tokens and withdraw them at a later stage. It&#8217;s a similar concept to earning compound interest on fiat currency.</p><p>To claim 25% APY, investors can opt for time-lock staking. That requires investors to lock in a certain number of IBAT tokens for a specific amount of time. In this case, investors need to lock in their coins for a year to claim 25% APY.</p><p>Other options include locking in coins half-yearly (20%), quarterly (17%) and monthly (14% APY).</p><p>Detailed information about how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-battle-infinity.htm">buy Battle Infinity tokens</a> and stake the coins is available on the platform&#8217;s website.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://battleinfinity.io/"><strong>Visit Battle Infinity Now</strong></a></p>
