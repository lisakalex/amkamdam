The digital currency is hailed as the future of money, an innovative solution to age-old problems, and a symbol of technological advancement. However, despite its many accolades, Bitcoin still suffers from a branding problem. This negative perception has been hard to shake off, hurting Bitcoin&#8217;s growth and adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>This article explores Bitcoin&rsquo;s strong brand, why it still has a branding problem, and how we &#8211; the Bitcoin community &#8211; can help fix Bitcoin&rsquo;s branding problem.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is a Powerful Brand</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin.htm"><strong>Bitcoin</strong></a> has established itself as an incredibly strong brand. Beyond its technological and financial innovations, Bitcoin&#8217;s successes can also be contributed to its strong brand identity. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Bitcoin is freedom money, enabling individuals to take back power from the banks by enabling them to be their own banks.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The cryptocurrency is also one of the best-performing investments of the past decade, acts as an alternative store of value (especially for people in countries with high inflation and tweaking currencies), and allows people to make permissionless, borderless payments. &nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Bitcoin was also invented by an anonymous person (or group of people) who never cashed out their coins. This, together with the currency&#8217;s iconic logo, name, and decentralized nature, has helped to differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Through years of media coverage, word-of-mouth, and vibrant online communities, Bitcoin&#8217;s brand recognition has been built up. Most people worldwide have at least heard about Bitcoin, whether through mainstream news, social media, or conversations with friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>This level of awareness is a testament to the strength of the Bitcoin brand and its ability to penetrate the public&rsquo;s consciousness.</p><h3>How Bitcoin&#8217;s Branding Dominates the Cryptocurrency World</h3><p>Bitcoin has benefited from its strong brand recognition more than any other cryptocurrency. While thousands of cryptocurrencies exist, Bitcoin remains the most recognizable and widely used.&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin currently represents <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/"><u>around 46%</u></a> of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The currency&rsquo;s strong brand recognition has also been a major driver of its adoption. Normally, people are initially drawn to Bitcoin as an investment opportunity. Once they invest, hoping to profit from its value going up, they begin to research more on the currency and thus become more interested in its other aspects. These aspects include its ability to complete transactions without intermediaries and its potential as a store of value or a medium of exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s branding has become synonymous with a host of qualities valued in society, such as decentralization, transparency, privacy, and security</strong>. These qualities have helped to enhance the currency&#8217;s reputation and drive its adoption (and are typically not found in other cryptocurrencies).</p><p>In addition to these qualities, Bitcoin&#8217;s strong brand recognition has made it an attractive option for businesses looking to accept cryptocurrency payments. By <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/who-accepts-bitcoin.htm"><strong>accepting bitcoin</strong></a>, businesses can tap into the currency&#8217;s vast network of users and gain access to a global customer base.</p><p>Bitcoin&#8217;s strong brand recognition has also been a key factor in the development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. Its success has spurred the creation of many other cryptocurrencies. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, Bitcoin&#8217;s brand recognition will remain an important factor in its success.</p><h2>Bitcoin Still Has a Branding Problem&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/109427/265319/brand-identity.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/109427/265319/responsive-images/brand-identity___media_library_original_1920_1280.jpg 1920w, https://cimg.co/news/109427/265319/responsive-images/brand-identity___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/109427/265319/responsive-images/brand-identity___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/109427/265319/responsive-images/brand-identity___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/109427/265319/responsive-images/brand-identity___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/109427/265319/responsive-images/brand-identity___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1920" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Despite being the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin struggles with its branding and brand perception.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One of the biggest challenges is the false narratives often perpetuated by mainstream media. Some of the most common misinformation about Bitcoin include that criminals primarily use it and that it is a Ponzi scheme. Unfortunately, these narratives have tainted the public perception of Bitcoin, even though its use in criminal activities only accounts for a small percentage of its overall transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin has also been under fire for its energy consumption, with accusations that it contributes to environmental destruction. However, this is largely due to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripples-larsen-teams-up-with-greenpeace-co-spend-usd-5m-recycling-bitcoin-mining-fud.htm"><strong>misinformation propagated</strong></a> by mainstream media.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, many still view Bitcoin merely as a speculative investment or internet money with no value in the real world. This perception has hindered Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to gain mainstream acceptance. While it is true that bitcoin&#8217;s value can be volatile, it has also shown resilience and potential for growth. As it continues to grow, this volatility will reduce. Additionally, it has many practical use cases, such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/40-of-surveyed-lower-income-individuals-want-to-use-bitcoin-not-to-make-money-but-for-payments-and-remittances.htm"><strong>remittances</strong></a>, online payments, and as a store of value.</p><p>The point remains that despite Bitcoin&#8217;s widespread recognition and dominance in the cryptocurrency market, it continues to face a branding problem. Until these negative perceptions are addressed, it will be difficult for it to gain wider adoption and reach its full potential.</p><h2>Fixing Bitcoin&rsquo;s Brand Will Remain an Uphill Battle&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>Fixing Bitcoin&#8217;s brand will require more work. Here&#8217;s why!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Firstly, most traditional <strong>banks and financial institutions have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo</strong> and are threatened by the disruptive nature of Bitcoin. Therefore, we can expect them to continue spreading negative narratives and doubt about Bitcoin. These groups usually claim that bitcoin is too volatile or too risky in an attempt to discourage people from adopting it as a form of payment or investment.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, <strong>environmental activists have targeted bitcoin mining</strong> as a major contributor to global warming, citing the amount of energy consumed in the process. The truth is that Bitcoin uses less electricity than many other industries, and a majority of its mining is powered by renewable energy sources, making it one of the most eco-friendly industries worldwide. Despite this, the negative publicity surrounding Bitcoin&#8217;s energy consumption persists, highlighting the need for accurate information to combat misconceptions.</p><p>Thirdly, <strong>politicians and regimes are keen on controlling their citizens&rsquo; view of Bitcoin as they perceive it as a threat to their power and control</strong>. As a result, they do everything in their power to demonize it and discourage its use. One of the ways they do this is by portraying it as a tool for criminals and terrorists. This portrayal further damages Bitcoin&#8217;s brand making it harder to gain mainstream acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p>The most difficult challenge is the fact that <strong>many individuals still see Bitcoin as a speculative investment</strong> or a form of internet money with no real-world value. This perception has made it tough for Bitcoin to gain widespread acceptance and further reinforces the need to fix its branding problem.</p><p>Lastly, <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature could also make it challenging to improve its brand</strong>. Unlike traditional businesses, there is no central authority to direct how Bitcoin is branded, marketed, or perceived. As a result, the responsibility of fixing Bitcoin&#8217;s brand falls on everyone who uses and supports the currency.</p><h2>How to Fix Bitcoin&rsquo;s Branding Problem</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In spite of the numerous challenges Bitcoin faces, its branding problem can be improved using numerous approaches, some of which are explained below.&nbsp;</p><h3>High-Quality Educational Content</h3><p>The <strong>first solution to Bitcoin&rsquo;s branding problem is to produce high-quality educational content that is factual and informative</strong>. This content can take many forms, including articles, videos, graphics, and podcasts. The content should be widely distributed through social media, blogs, online communities, events, email, and other channels.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <strong>using memes can be one of the most effective ways to fight the spread of misinformation</strong> about Bitcoin. Memes are funny and can enable quick and easy sharing of information and ideas. Therefore, something as simple and effective as community-led <a href="https://riseup.media/meme-marketing-for-bitcoin-startups/"><u>meme marketing</u></a> can be a powerful tool for correcting false narratives about Bitcoin.</p><h3>Engaging Mainstream Media and Authorities</h3><p>Another important step is <strong>correcting any misinformation mainstream media perpetuates about Bitcoin</strong>. By discussing and confronting the media with accurate and reliable information, we can help dispel myths about Bitcoin&#8217;s energy consumption, use cases, and potential to change the world&rsquo;s economy. This way, we may start seeing positive media coverage about Bitcoin, which will help reshape its public perception.</p><p><strong>Engaging with authorities such as regulators, lawmakers, and politicians</strong> is essential in correcting Bitcoin&rsquo;s reputation. Authorities need education about the benefits of Bitcoin. For example, how it can support economic growth and promote financial inclusion. Engaging with these groups can create more favorable regulatory environments for Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><h3>Becoming a Bitcoin Brand Ambassador</h3><p>Ultimately, the main solution to Bitcoin&#8217;s branding issue is to fix its perception in the public eye. Achieving this starts with every individual and business that forms part of the Bitcoin community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>By educating ourselves about the current state of Bitcoin and its potential, we can become powerful ambassadors</strong> for the technology and share reliable knowledge. This means consuming high-quality content and sharing it with anyone interested. It also entails engaging in thoughtful discussions and dispelling myths about Bitcoin wherever we encounter them.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin is a powerful brand that is already revolutionizing the financial world. However, its negative perception is hindering it from reaching its full potential.&nbsp;</p><p>Fixing Bitcoin&#8217;s branding problem will be difficult, but it is a battle that can be won. By focusing on high-quality education, engaging the various sources of misinformation, and acting as personal Bitcoin ambassadors, the Bitcoin community can change the narrative surrounding Bitcoin and create a more positive perception of the currency.<br>&nbsp;</p>

Some argue it&#8217;s a significant contributor to global warming, while others believe it&#8217;s not as big of a problem as it&#8217;s made out to be.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what&#8217;s the issue with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-bitcoin-mining-works.htm">Bitcoin mining</a> and the environment?</p><p>First, let&#8217;s understand how bitcoin mining works. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, meaning no government or financial institution controls it. Instead, transactions made with bitcoin are verified and recorded on a public ledger called the Bitcoin Blockchain. For this to happen, Bitcoin miners solve mathematical problems to verify transactions using specialized computers. They earn newly minted bitcoin and transaction fees as rewards for their effort.</p><p>The perceived problem with bitcoin mining is that it consumes large amounts of electricity. According to some (arguably questionable) estimates, the electricity consumed by bitcoin mining is equivalent to the annual energy consumption of small countries. This has led to the claim that bitcoin mining significantly contributes to global warming.</p><h2>Is Bitcoin Really an Environmental Villain?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index">reports</a> that Bitcoin consumes 122.74 TWh annually, which is only 0.6% of the world&#8217;s electricity as of March 2023. Critics argue that Bitcoin consumes more electricity than countries like Argentina but fail to consider that Bitcoin has more users than Argentina has citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>As for carbon emissions, Bitcoin is not even among the top polluters. You would have to replace gold mining, air conditioners, the military-industrial complex, and aviation before even considering Bitcoin&#8217;s carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, while Bitcoin&#8217;s carbon output has increased since 2018 due to its increased adoption, alternatives are already in development.</p><p>The reality is that most of the power used to mine bitcoin comes from renewable sources such as wind, solar, water, and geothermal energy. In fact, a recent report by CoinShares estimated that<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-over-74-bitcoin-mining-180300738.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMPcyfswBWfem-K7D3E80B_lpqOWzwf46ek4W89WoyKn0wx8HfvU3B2NHi9pWWnQj1OW0jrPisK8X36R5DXWtDCJWiOy39LRFXbHTdv_PJiNxzq4BsXdfvBBWeyvvjEN8GM7mKZAXMb_xSr2telkO7DUFrJ9_Y4_y6vWjlRtcgUp"><u> 74.1% of bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Because bitcoin miners, especially in recent years, tend to set up their operations in areas where electricity is cheap and abundant, often in regions with access to clean, renewable energy sources.</p><p>So, while there are valid concerns about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, the perceived problem may be smaller, some experts claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the power used to mine bitcoin comes from clean, renewable sources, and many miners are taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint even further.&nbsp;</p><p>And since miners are looking to maximize Bitcoin mining profits, they are always looking to find cheaper energy sources to power their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/hardware-for-bitcoin-mining.htm">mining machines</a>, leading to innovation in sustainable energy solutions.</p><h2>The Reality of Bitcoin Mining&rsquo;s Move Towards Sustainable Energy</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As Bitcoin&#8217;s popularity has grown, so has its mining demand. And with that demand comes a need for energy to power the mining process.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, this energy was often generated by non-renewable sources such as coal and natural gas in China, leading to concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.</p><p>However, <strong>Bitcoin mining is moving towards sustainable energy</strong>, and it&rsquo;s happening fast. Mining farms are now actively seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint and transition to sustainable energy sources like hydropower, wind power, and solar power.</p><p>One of the main drivers behind this shift towards sustainable energy is the growing awareness of the environmental impact of traditional energy sources. Using fossil fuels for energy production has contributed significantly to climate change, and the Bitcoin mining industry is taking steps to mitigate its contribution to the problem.</p><p>Another development is the emergence of innovative technologies that make Bitcoin mining more energy-efficient. For example, using liquid immersion cooling technology can reduce energy consumption by up to 90% compared to traditional air-cooling methods.&nbsp;</p><p>The move towards sustainable energy is not only beneficial for the environment, but it also makes economic sense for mining companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are becoming increasingly cheaper and more accessible, making them an attractive option for Bitcoin miners. In fact, many mining companies are now located in areas with an abundance of renewable energy, such as Iceland, where geothermal power is readily available.</p><p>Lastly, the shift towards sustainable energy can potentially change the perception of Bitcoin mining. The industry has been criticized for its high energy consumption and carbon footprint, but by embracing sustainable energy sources, Bitcoin mining can become a part of the solution rather than a problem.</p><p>With the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources, innovative, energy-efficient technologies, and global initiatives to promote sustainability, Bitcoin mining is poised to become more eco-friendly and cost-effective in the years to come.</p><h2>5 Companies Making Bitcoin Mining More Sustainable</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/108402/263188/mining-sustainability.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/108402/263188/responsive-images/mining-sustainability___media_library_original_1280_853.jpg 1280w, https://cimg.co/news/108402/263188/responsive-images/mining-sustainability___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/108402/263188/responsive-images/mining-sustainability___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/108402/263188/responsive-images/mining-sustainability___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/108402/263188/responsive-images/mining-sustainability___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/108402/263188/responsive-images/mining-sustainability___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1280" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of the companies making Bitcoin mining more sustainable.&nbsp;</p><h3>Hive Blockchain Technologies</h3><p>Hive Blockchain Technologies is a fast-growing and sustainable Bitcoin mining company.

However, with recent developments, Bitcoin mining could become a significant driving force for renewable energy solutions.</strong></p><p>The use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, has been growing in recent years. These sources have become increasingly cost-effective, making them more<u> </u>attractive to businesses and governments seeking to reduce their carbon footprint. Bitcoin mining companies have taken note of this trend and are actively and rapidly shifting toward renewable energy sources.</p><p>Bitcoin mining can act as a driver for renewable energy solutions because it creates a demand for renewable energy and encourages investment in developing renewable energy infrastructure. Bitcoin mining is a 24/7 operation, requiring a consistent energy supply to keep the network running. This energy supply can be met by renewable sources, which can provide a steady supply of power over a long period.</p><p>As Bitcoin mining continues to grow, it could drive innovation in the renewable energy sector. The need for efficient and cost-effective energy sources to power Bitcoin mining could lead to the development of new technologies and solutions, such as Intel&rsquo;s Blockscale ASIC chips. These innovations could be applied to other industries, leading to the wider adoption of renewable energy sources.</p><p>Furthermore, developing renewable energy solutions for Bitcoin mining can also help bring electricity to remote areas where traditional power sources are unavailable or unreliable. This can have a positive impact on local communities, as it can lead to the creation of jobs and stimulate economic growth.</p><p>In the past, sustainable energy has struggled to maintain momentum due to funding constraints. But with the immense capital-raising potential of the Bitcoin market, this could be the final push that sustainable energy needs to really take off. So, not only is Bitcoin mining benefiting from the shift towards greener energy, but it&#8217;s also helping to accelerate the development of sustainable energy solutions.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stacks has been making waves since the start of the year as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-ordinals-nft-collections.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals</a> brought attention to Bitcoin NFTs, which already exist on the Stacks blockchain as layer-2 NFTs, thus creating a surge in demand for STX and increasing trading volumes among Stacks-based NFTs.  </p>
<p>In this guide, we look at the Stacks blockchain, how it works, how it differs from other chains, and what types of decentralized applications (DApps) you can find in the Stacks ecosystem. </p>
<h2>What is Stacks?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>Stacks is a Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain protocol that is improving the functionality of Bitcoin through self-executing smart contracts without the need for a Bitcoin fork. </strong></p>
<p>This means that <a href="https://stacks.co">Stacks</a> can bring new functionalities to Bitcoin, like decentralized applications and smart contract functionality, without changing any of Bitcoin’s features. It uses the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, which we’ll cover more in this guide. </p>
<p>Before its rebranding to Stacks in 2020, Stacks was known as Blockstack and was co-founded by two Princeton alumni &#8211; Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea &#8211; in 2017. Its development began after the company secured $50 million via a token offering. The company spent 2018 developing its mainnet, and in 2019, Blockstack had its public sale becoming the first-ever US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) controlled token sale. </p>
<p>In the same year, STX was listed by multiple leading crypto asset exchanges. Today, Stacks has established itself as a popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin, with a small but growing ecosystem of Bitcoin builders looking to create <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3</a> applications secured by the Bitcoin network. </p>
<h2>What is STX?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Stacks blockchain has its own native digital token, known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/stx-stacks/">Stacks (STX)</a>, which powers the Stacks ecosystem. </p>
<p>STX is used to execute Bitcoin smart contracts that utilize the Clarity programming language, process transactions, reward miners on the Stacks network, and enable its holders to earn BTC via a process known as stacking. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, STX has has a total market capitalization of over $1.5 billion and the token&#8217;s price is hovering around the $1.15 mark. </p>
<h2>Proof-of-Transfer Explained</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto networks use a consensus mechanism to secure the blockchain. Two of the most commonly used consensus mechanism are Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). </p>
<p>In PoW, miners have to solve a mathematical puzzle to validate a transaction, while in PoS, the blockchain relies on stakers to verify crypto transactions. With both mechanisms, miners and stakers earn rewards in exchange for validating transactions.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Burn (PoB) is another infrequently used consensus mechanism. In PoB, miners compete to ‘burn’ a PoW token as a substitute for computing resources. </p>
<p>Stacks’ consensus mechanism &#8211; PoX (Proof of Transfer) &#8211; is an extension of PoB. How? The PoX mechanism relies on a PoW digital currency of an already-established blockchain (Bitcoin) to secure a new blockchain. However, contrary to the Proof-of-Burn mechanism, miners must transfer the pledged digital tokens to selected participants within the network instead of burning the tokens. Also, because all Stacks’ transactions are settled on Bitcoin, users can enjoy Bitcoin’s security. </p>
<p>Miners within the Stacks ecosystem transfer Bitcoin that’s used to give Stacking rewards paid in BTC to token holders as a reward for helping to secure the network. To achieve this, Stackers have to lock up their STX tokens for a specific period of time and provide their BTC address to receive their rewards. Stackers get to unlock their STX holdings once the cycles they committed to come to an end. </p>
<p>The Proof-of-Transfer mechanism has several benefits for blockchains like Stacks. </p>
<ul>
<li>Stacks leverages Bitcoin’s security. </li>
<li>Apps that have been developed on Stacks can easily interact with Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain state and data.</li>
<li>No special hardware is needed to participate in PoX. Thus, anyone can become a miner. In addition, they also get to reuse the energy that Bitcoin had already expended via its Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. </li>
<li>Stackers get to earn BTC for securing the network. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Stacking Stacks &amp; How Does It Work? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://www.xverse.app/blog/earn-bitcoin-by-stacking-with-xverse-wallet">Stacking stacks</a> is a progressive mechanism that rewards STX token holders for participating in Stacks’ Proof-of-Transfer consensus mechanism. STX holders who engage in stacking are known as Stackers. </p>
<p>Each time a new block gets mined on the Stacks blockchain, the platform sends the committed BTC by miners to Stackers as a reward for securing the network. All Stackers get awarded Bitcoin after roughly every stacking cycle. However, the stacking cycles aren’t constant and vary based on various factors. </p>
<p>To participate in Stacking, Stackers need to have a Stacks wallet whose version is 4 or higher. Additionally, they can also use various applications and services offered by other entities. STX holders also need a minimum amount of STX  to take part in stacking directly. The amount is approximately 100,000 STX, which varies based on the overall supply and participation. </p>
<p>Any STX holder keen on participating and doesn’t hold the minimum STX needed can join a stacking pool. </p>
<h2>What Can You Find in the Stacks Ecosystem? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Stacks layer-2 protocol has multiple benefits for developers as it can unlock <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other web3 applications. Let&#8217;s look at what you can find on Stacks. </p>
<h3>NFTs</h3>
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique cryptographic tokens representing an asset or an item. NFTs are built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity programming language and then settled and secured using Bitcoin. Users can then send, receive, and store their NFTs using a non-custodial Stacks wallet like Hiro or Xverse.  </p>
<h3>DeFi</h3>
<p>The Bitcoin decentralized finance sector remains a largely untapped market despite the increased adoption of Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Stacks has been built to enhance DeFi for Bitcoin as it can leverage Bitcoin’s settlement and security assurances. The ability for smart contracts to be executed on Bitcoin is also a functionality that’s been made possible through the Stacks blockchain. Additionally, all transactions on Stacks settle on Bitcoin via the PoX consensus mechanism. </p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<p>Like most blockchains, Stacks users can access various games on the Stacks network. The best part is that users can enjoy various games without revealing identifying information. Additionally, as a gamer, you can potentially earn rewards in STX. </p>
<h2>Is the Stacks (STX) Token a Good Investment? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Whether STX is a good investment depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. If you are comfortable taking a lot of risk and want to invest in a Bitcoin layer-2 token, STX may be right for you. </p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that Stacks has its own blockchain and ecosystem. So, if Bitcoin succeeds, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean Stacks will also experience similar success. </p>
<p>Before deciding to invest or not invest in Stacks, you must research STX to ensure you fully understand what you are investing in. Moreover, all crypto investing carries risk, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. <br /> </p>

These numbers are referred to as Ordinals, and each Ordinal is numbered in the order they are mined.&nbsp;</p><p>The creation of Ordinals enables digital assets, such as security tokens, stablecoins, or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/a-beginner-s-guide-to-nfts-what-you-should-know.htm">NFTs</a>, to be attached to an Ordinal.&nbsp;</p><p>Through a process called inscribing, Ordinals can be inscribed with content (such as image or video files) to create on-chain crypto collectibles, which Rodarmor refers to as digital artifacts. These digital artifacts have now widely become known as Bitcoin NFTs.&nbsp;</p><p>The difference between common NFTs found on Ethereum, and other smart contract-enabled layer-1 chains, are that this new type of Bitcoin NFT is stored forever directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, whereas traditional NFTs are stored in a third-party database and collectors essentially only have ownership of the link to that file in their crypto wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs are, therefore, much more appealing for collectors who are looking to hold their NFTs for a long period of time as they won&rsquo;t have to worry about their NFT disappearing.</p><h2>5 Popular Bitcoin Ordinals NFT Collections</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of the Bitcoin NFT collections that emerged as favorites in the early days of the Ordinals NFTs market.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin Shrooms</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261531/image3.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261531/responsive-images/image3___media_library_original_1325_593.jpg 1325w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261531/responsive-images/image3___media_library_original_1200_537.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261531/responsive-images/image3___media_library_original_900_403.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261531/responsive-images/image3___media_library_original_720_322.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261531/responsive-images/image3___media_library_original_600_269.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261531/responsive-images/image3___media_library_original_300_134.jpg 300w" width="1325" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><a href="https://bitcoinshrooms.com/about.html"><u>Bitcoin Shrooms</u></a> tops our list as one of the first Bitcoin Ordinals NFT collections to be created. The first shroom was Inscription 19, created by an unknown group of people, which alludes to the mystery and anonymity of the Bitcoin blockchain. Currently, only 210 Bitcoin Shrooms are inscribed into the Bitcoin blockchain, which are referred to as &lsquo;Digital Artifacts&rsquo; on their site.&nbsp;</p><p>The Shrooms collection is yet to be auctioned or sold by its owners, with the collection&rsquo;s Twitter page stating that its Discord page has been closed. With that, many collectors are excited for when the Shrooms finally go on sale.</p><h3>Ordinal Punks</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261533/image5.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261533/responsive-images/image5___media_library_original_1342_512.jpg 1342w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261533/responsive-images/image5___media_library_original_1200_458.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261533/responsive-images/image5___media_library_original_900_343.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261533/responsive-images/image5___media_library_original_720_275.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261533/responsive-images/image5___media_library_original_600_229.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261533/responsive-images/image5___media_library_original_300_114.jpg 300w" width="1342" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>The second Bitcoin Ordinals collection that is gaining popularity is the <a href="https://ordinalpunks.com/"><u>Ordinal Punks</u></a> collection which pays homage to the famous Crypto Punks collection of NFTs. Ordinal Punks has 100 different &lsquo;punk&rsquo; characters, with the first Ordinal Punk recorded as inscription 642 on the Bitcoin blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the collection, created by an anonymous person known as FlowStay, is on sale, with the lowest bid being 3.7 BTC while the highest is at 50 BTC (although it&#8217;s hard to verify whether these bids are legitimate).

Most of the news on the project and distribution is communicated via the collection&rsquo;s Twitter and Discord pages.</p><h3>Ordinals Loops</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261530/image2.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261530/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_1342_504.jpg 1342w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261530/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_1200_451.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261530/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_900_338.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261530/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_720_270.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261530/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_600_225.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261530/responsive-images/image2___media_library_original_300_113.jpg 300w" width="1342" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.ordinalloops.xyz/"><u>Ordinal Loops</u></a> project is a Bitcoin Inscription collection that aims to have Bitcoin Artifacts representing the philosophy and ethos of Bitcoin and how the network brings change to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ordinals team, whose members are unknown, has created two chapters in the project. The first is known as the &lsquo;Do Not Fiat&rsquo; series. It depicts Bitcoin&rsquo;s role in working against the major Fiat currencies. The second series is the &lsquo;Roots of Immutability&rsquo; which pays homage to the seven hashes which have significantly impacted the Bitcoin network. The third collection is yet to be released.</p><p>The objects in the collection go on sale on the project&rsquo;s Discord group, with one of the highest bids currently worth 4.178 BTC. However, Ordinal Loops donate parts of their earnings to Bitcoin-based projects like the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Open Sats Legal Defence Fund, and Casey Rodarmor&rsquo;s 21st OpenDime. Further, object number 4 wasn&rsquo;t sold to the public but, instead, is held collectively by a group of 21 people in what they call a &lsquo;SATDAO.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Ordinal Loops is considered one of the first inscriptions, with its first object being inscription 452.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin Rocks Ordinals</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261529/image1.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/107463/261529/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_680_383.jpg 680w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261529/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/107463/261529/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w" width="680" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ordrocks">Bitcoin Rocks</a> have been created by Ordrocks and pay tribute to the famous &lsquo;Ether Rocks&rsquo; collection, which was amongst the most prolific NFT collections on Ethereum. The collection holds one of the earliest inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, with the first rock being inscription 71. Ordrocks has inscribed 100 Bitcoin Rocks since then.</p><p>Despite not having a website, the Bitcoin Rocks Ordinals have an active Discord group and a Twitter account that keeps people updated on the collection. The highest bid for a Bitcoin Rock is currently 1000 BTC, although it is hard to ascertain whether it is genuine.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where to Store Your Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>To store your Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs, you currently only have the choice between a handful of Bitcoin wallets that provide Ordinal support.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.xverse.app/">Xverse</a> has seemingly emerged as the most popular Bitcoin wallet to store and manage Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs. The wallet also allows you to <a href="https://www.xverse.app/blog/how-to-inscribe-ordinal-bitcoin-nfts-5-easy-steps">inscribe Ordinals</a> using the wallet&#8217;s Chrome extension or mobile app, enabling anyone to create Bitcoin NFTs simply and easily. &nbsp;</p><p>Hiro Wallet, Sparrow Wallet, and Ordinals Wallet also enable you to store your Bitcoin Ordinals, with more wallets expected to follow suit given the fast-rising popularity of Ordinals.&nbsp;</p><p>While Bitcoin Ordinals are currently only traded over-the-counter (OTC), several <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-nft-marketplaces.htm">NFT marketplaces</a> are already working on supporting these new types of NFTs. <a href="https://gamma.io/ordinals">Gamma</a>, for example, already allows users to create image and text-based Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs and enables users to view Ordinals collections.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Will the Future Hold?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As more Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs collections, it will be interesting to see what impact Ordinals will have on the Bitcoin network and the wider NFT collector community.&nbsp;</p><p>While some Bitcoiners are worried it could affect Bitcoin&#8217;s mission of becoming the best money we&#8217;ve ever had, others believe the fact that they are bringing fun back to Bitcoin will be a net positive for Bitcoin adoption.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

This article looks at software wallets, which are considered hot wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin software wallets are categorized into web, mobile, and desktop wallets. Users can access web wallets online via any web service, while desktop and mobile wallets are accessed via desktop and mobile devices respectively. Finally, there are also hybrid wallets that you can access on multiple platforms. &nbsp;</p><h2>Best Bitcoin-Only Software Wallets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Now, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the most popular Bitcoin-only wallets you can use on your desktop and/or smartphone. We have split the list into on-chain-only wallets and those that also support the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin-btc-lightning-network.htm">Bitcoin Lightning Network</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>On-Chain Bitcoin Wallets</h3><p>Here are the top on-chain Bitcoin wallets you can use.&nbsp;</p><h4>Bitcoin Core</h4><p><a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/about/"><u>Bitcoin Core</u></a> is a full node Bitcoin wallet that validates transactions and relays them to the Bitcoin network. The wallet is entirely open-source, meaning any software developer can audit the code and confirm that the software wallet doesn&rsquo;t hide secrets from users. In addition, it gives users complete control over their BTC, meaning no third party can access their assets. Users are, however, still responsible for backing up and securing their wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>As a full node Bitcoin wallet, Bitcoin Core provides a high level of security since no third parties are involved when verifying a transaction. However, since the software is loaded on devices that are vulnerable to malware, users need to secure their devices by enabling two-factor authentication and using solid passcodes.&nbsp;</p><p>The wallet requires an ample space of about 500GB and an additional 5-10GB per month. Users must store all this data, although it&rsquo;s possible to reduce it to about 6GB by enabling pruning.&nbsp;</p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Full node validation</li><li>Excellent privacy</li><li>Great user interface</li></ul><h4>Samourai</h4><p>The <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/features"><u>Samourai wallet</u></a> is one of the most feature-rich Bitcoin-only software wallets with a unique focus on privacy and security.

One such tool is the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model, which aims to predict the price of Bitcoin based on its scarcity.&nbsp;</p><p>In this guide, we&#8217;ll explore what the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model is, the pros and cons of the model, and whether you can use it to trade bitcoin.</p><h2>What is the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The mastermind behind the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model is a Twitter user known as <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD"><u>PlanB</u></a>. Despite their mysterious identity, they claim to be a highly-skilled institutional investor hailing from the Netherlands, with a background in both legal and quantitative finance.&nbsp;</p><p>PlanB took the classic Stock-to-Flow model and put a digital twist on it, using it to make predictions on the value of bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin">BTC</a>). With the S2F&#8217;s predictions proving to be accurate multiple times in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-history.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s short history</a>, PlanB&#8217;s Stock-to-Flow Model quickly became a popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trading-tools/">tool</a> for Bitcoin investors.&nbsp;</p><p>The Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model is an economic model that measures the relationship between the existing stock (supply) of a commodity and its flow (annual production or supply growth). The Stock-to-Flow ratio is calculated as the stock divided by the flow and is used to measure the scarcity of a commodity.&nbsp;</p><h3>Stock-to-Flow = Stock/Flow</h3><p><strong>The Stock-to-Flow model was originally developed for precious metals such as gold and silver but has since been applied to other assets, including Bitcoin.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the case of Bitcoin, the Stock-to-Flow model compares the current stock of Bitcoin to its annual production, which is the new bitcoins that are created through mining.</p><blockquote><p>The Stock-to-Flow ratio is calculated as the stock divided by the flow and is used to measure the scarcity of a commodity. A high Stock-to-Flow ratio implies a low annual production and a relatively large existing stock, which typically leads to a higher perceived value and price.</p></blockquote><p>To put this into better perspective, let&#8217;s take a look at the Stock-to-Flow of gold. The stock of gold is 197,576 tonnes, and the flow is 3,000 tonnes per year. This calculation gives us a Stock-to-Flow ratio of 65.85, meaning it would take approximately 66 years of mining to double the amount of gold currently in circulation. This shows that gold is very scarce, compared to silver, which has a Stock-to-Flow ratio of 22. This helps explain why gold is more expensive, with a cost of $1,914 per ounce, while silver is priced at $23 per ounce.</p><p>Similarly, we can calculate the Stock-to-Flow of Bitcoin as of 31 Jan 2023. The stock (supply) of bitcoin is 19.28 million, and there are currently about 385,000 bitcoin being mined in a year.</p><p>19.28M/385K = 58.69.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we know the exact supply of bitcoin even in the future, we can calculate its Stock-to-Flow and predict future prices, and thus make more informed investment decisions.</p><h2>How Bitcoin&#8217;s Scarcity Affects the Stock-to-Flow Model</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The scarcity of Bitcoin is a crucial factor in understanding its value and price, and it&#8217;s closely tied to the Stock-to-Flow model.&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin has a finite supply, with only 21 million bitcoins ever to be created. This scarcity, combined with the increasing demand for the currency, creates an upward pressure on its price.</p><p>One important aspect of Bitcoin&#8217;s scarcity is the halving event. Every four years, the rate at which new bitcoin are mined by miners is cut in half. When Bitcoin was first introduced, miners were rewarded with 50 bitcoins per block. This amount was reduced to 25 bitcoin in 2012 and further reduced to 12.5 bitcoin in 2016. As of May 2020, the reward for mining a new block is 6.25 bitcoin.</p><p>This pattern of reducing the flow of new bitcoin into the market is set to continue, which means that the Stock-to-Flow ratio of Bitcoin will continue to increase.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, there will be almost no new supply of bitcoin entering the market, leaving its price to be solely determined by demand. This situation has led to some optimistic predictions regarding the future price of bitcoin.</p><h3>The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Chart</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/105299/257719/stock-to-flow.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/105299/257719/responsive-images/stock-to-flow___media_library_original_1828_832.jpg 1828w, https://cimg.co/news/105299/257719/responsive-images/stock-to-flow___media_library_original_1200_546.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/105299/257719/responsive-images/stock-to-flow___media_library_original_900_410.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/105299/257719/responsive-images/stock-to-flow___media_library_original_720_328.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/105299/257719/responsive-images/stock-to-flow___media_library_original_600_273.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/105299/257719/responsive-images/stock-to-flow___media_library_original_300_137.jpg 300w" width="1828" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow chart provides a visual representation of the Stock-to-Flow ratio over time and is used by some investors to assess the current state of the market. The chart shows the historical Stock-to-Flow ratio of bitcoin, as well as projected ratios for future years.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Like any economic model, the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model has its strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the pros and cons of the model:</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li>Provides <strong>a framework for understanding</strong> the relationship between scarcity, value, and price in the case of Bitcoin.</li><li>Offers a simple and <strong>straightforward method for assessing the current state of the market</strong> based on scarcity.</li><li><strong>Provides a long-term perspective:</strong> The Stock-to-Flow Model takes into account the long-term supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin, making it a valuable tool for those looking to make long-term investment decisions.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Limited scope:</strong> The Stock-to-Flow Model does not take into account other factors that can impact the price of bitcoin, such as demand, market sentiment, regulatory changes, global economic conditions, technological advancements, and competition from other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Historical data only:</strong> While the Stock-to-Flow model has been accurate in the past, it is based solely on historic data and does not account for unpredictable events that could impact the price of bitcoin in the future.</li></ul><h2>Can You Use Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model to Trade Bitcoin?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The short answer is yes; you could use the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model to trade bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>By understanding the Stock-to-Flow ratio and the historical trends of the market, traders and investors could make decisions about buying and selling bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>However,<strong> it&#8217;s essential to keep in mind that the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model is just one tool among many, and should not be relied upon exclusively.</strong> Many factors can impact the price of bitcoin, and it&#8217;s essential to consider these other factors when making investment decisions.</p><p>Additionally, it&#8217;s crucial to approach any type of trading or investment with caution and to thoroughly research and understand the market before making any decisions. While the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model can provide valuable information and insights, it&#8217;s always important to consider multiple sources of information and to use a combination of different tools and methods when analyzing the market.</p><p>In conclusion, the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model is a useful tool for understanding the relationship between scarcity, value, and price in the case of bitcoin. By taking into account the scarcity of the currency and the historical trends of the market, traders and investors can make informed decisions about buying and selling bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it&#8217;s essential to keep in mind that the model is just one tool among many, and should be used in conjunction with other sources of information and analysis.</p>

The traditional ways of buying bitcoin through exchanges aren&rsquo;t suitable for high-volume purchases due to the relatively low liquidity on Bitcoin exchanges and the potential for price slippage.&nbsp;</p><p>OTC bitcoin brokers provide more discrete and secure channels for high-net-worth individuals, professional traders, and institutional investors to buy and sell large quantities of bitcoin (BTC) at the best possible price. These brokers protect their customers from negatively impacting their execution price due to price slippage, which would likely be the case if they traded on a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">crypto exchange</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>OTC bitcoin brokers leverage a network of counterparties (buyers and sellers) to execute trades and fulfill their clients&#8217; trading needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Patrick Lowry, CEO of <a href="https://cryptology-ag.com/"><u>Cryptology AG</u></a>, told Cryptonews.com:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;OTC brokers play an essential role in the Bitcoin trading ecosystem because they enable professional and institutional investors to buy and sell the digital currency while reducing their trades&#8217; impact on the execution price. If you are looking to shift 100 BTC, for example, placing a handful of large orders on an exchange would move the market as it would signal that there&#8217;s a larger buy or seller in town. Using an OTC broker, you&#8217;d probably be able to make that trade directly with another large counterparty in one or a two transactions.&#8221; &nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>Top 7 OTC Bitcoin Brokers</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/104699/256538/behnam-norouzi-tqhgxyx1d04-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/104699/256538/responsive-images/behnam-norouzi-tqhgxyx1d04-unsplash___media_library_original_1920_1280.jpg 1920w, https://cimg.co/news/104699/256538/responsive-images/behnam-norouzi-tqhgxyx1d04-unsplash___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/104699/256538/responsive-images/behnam-norouzi-tqhgxyx1d04-unsplash___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/104699/256538/responsive-images/behnam-norouzi-tqhgxyx1d04-unsplash___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/104699/256538/responsive-images/behnam-norouzi-tqhgxyx1d04-unsplash___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/104699/256538/responsive-images/behnam-norouzi-tqhgxyx1d04-unsplash___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1920" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Now that you know what over-the-counter bitcoin brokers are, let&#8217;s go over some of the more popular bitcoin brokers in the space.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin Reserve</h3><p><a href="https://bitcoinreserve.com/"><u>Bitcoin Reserve</u></a> is an Estonian-based over-the-counter (OTC) trading service that allows you to purchase bitcoin (BTC) or bitcoin-related assets worth over 10,000 USD OR EUR.

However, to access and use DApps, users need to have a compatible web3 wallet, and not all wallets are compatible with every DApp. This is where WalletConnect comes in.</p><p>In this beginner&rsquo;s guide, we look at WalletConnect and how you can use it to connect your mobile crypto wallets to decentralized applications across multiple blockchains.</p><h2>What Is Wallet Connect?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that allows you to connect your mobile crypto wallet to different decentralized applications and other crypto wallets.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The protocol achieves this through QR code scanning and deep linking, creating a remote and encrypted connection between your mobile crypto wallet and a specific DApp.&nbsp;</p><p>WalletConnect was created by Pedro Gomes in 2018 and has grown to become a leading wallet infrastructure in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm"><strong>Web3 ecosystem</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we know what is WalletConnect, let&rsquo;s take a look at how it works in practice.</p><h2>How Does Wallet Connect Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Today, the crypto market is flooded with various wallets available for use. And while this is a plus, it also has its downsides. One such drawback is that DApp developers are unable to carry out native support for all the wallets that are available.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where WalletConnect comes in handy, as developers can easily and effortlessly implement connections between crypto wallets and DApps. WalletConnect utilizes a shared key between two peers to create the encrypted connection, which makes it secure.</p><p>Given how secure WalletConnect is, you can process all your transactions in a secure manner without the need to reveal any personal identifying information as a user. Thus, this protocol guarantees both safety and privacy, something that browser extensions can&rsquo;t guarantee.</p><h2>How to Set Up And Use Wallet Connect</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Using WalletConnect to connect to different decentralized applications varies from mobile to web browsers. What remains constant, however, is that the process is both fast and straightforward.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any issues connecting your crypto wallet to WalletConnect, which may occasionally happen, ensure you return to the start and repeat the step-by-step process. In addition, before you get started, make sure that your mobile crypto wallet actually supports WalletConnect.&nbsp;</p><p>For this guide, we will use Aave and Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-use-aave.htm"><strong>Aave</strong></a> is a decentralized crypto lending platform that uses smart contracts to enable users to borrow, lend and earn interest on crypto, while Trust Wallet is a leading mobile web3 wallet.

Look no further! Read on to discover a comprehensive guide on how to buy a Tom Brady NFT, including information on who Tom Brady is, what the Tom Brady NFT collection consists of, how much you can expect to pay, and more.</p><h2>Who is Tom Brady?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Tom Brady is a professional American football player who is widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of the sport. He has played for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) for much of his career and has led the team to numerous division, conference, and Super Bowl titles.&nbsp;</p><p>Brady has also been named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times, and has been selected to the Pro Bowl, the all-star game for the NFL, 14 times. He has also set many NFL records, including the most passing yards, touchdowns, and completions in a career.</p><p>While he has achieved a great deal of success on the football field, Brady has also become a well-known ambassador for NFTs and cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>What is the Tom Brady NFT Collection?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>On December 9, 2021, Tom Brady continued to make waves in the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with the successful launch of his &#8220;Live Forever: The Tom Brady Origins Collection&#8221; NFTs on Autograph.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://autograph.io/"><strong><u>Autograph</u></strong></a> is an NFT platform co-founded by Brady and the father-son team of Richard and Dillon Rosenblatt. This collection featured 16,600 NFTs stored in mystery boxes and sold for $80 each during its public sale on Dec 9, 2021. The collection takes a nostalgic look at the early days of Brady&#8217;s NFL career, showcasing memorabilia from key events leading up to his draft in 2000.</p><p>But that&#8217;s not all that makes this collection unique. It also includes 25 sets of tiered collectibles, each with its level of rarity. These collectibles include Tom Brady&rsquo;s:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Combine Cleats</li><li>College Resume</li><li>Rookie Draft Card</li><li>Combine Jersey</li><li>Combine Stopwatch</li></ul><p>For those who may not be familiar with American football, the term &#8220;combine&#8221; refers to a week-long event during which college football players participate in physical and mental tests to showcase their skills to NFL coaches. The Combine takes place in the lead-up to the NFL Draft, and the items tokenized as part of Tom Brady&#8217;s Origin collection were used during his Combine in 2000.</p><h3>Rarity Tiers</h3><p>In total, there are five tiers of rarity in the Origin collection:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Carbon</li><li>Platinum</li><li>Emerald</li><li>Sapphire</li><li>Ruby</li></ul><p>The Carbon versions of these items are the least rare, while the Ruby versions are the rarest.</p><p>But that&#8217;s not all. The Tom Brady NFT collection also includes special <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm">NFT</a> collectibles called &#8220;Immortal Statues,&#8221; which come in the same five tiers of rarity as the other items in the collection. These statues are designed to reward collectors who meet specific requirements, such as owning all five of the aforementioned items in the same rarity tier and linking their DraftKings and Autograph accounts by a specific deadline.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a collector who owns a Sapphire set of the combine cleats, college resume, rookie draft card, combine jersey, and stopwatch at the activation deadline will receive a Sapphire Immortal Statue.</p><p>The Ruby and Sapphire versions of the Immortal Statues are particularly valuable, as they have been signed by Tom Brady, adding to their already significant worth. Overall, the Origins Collection offers collectors a unique and exciting opportunity to own a piece of NFL history and potentially earn one of these rare, signed statues.</p><h2>How Much Does a Tom Brady NFT Cost?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The initial sale price for each NFT was $80, but as you can imagine, prices can fluctuate on the secondary market as collectors buy and sell them. It&#8217;s important to note that Autograph charges the seller of any NFT a 5% processing fee and a 10% royalty fee.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the lowest price you can expect to pay for one of Tom Brady&#8217;s Origin NFTs on the secondary market is <a href="https://marketplace.draftkings.com/collection/TomBradyOriginsCollection/8b6dc5f7d703444da94dfad20a650b9e"><u>$23</u></a> at the time of writing. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this price might go up when the NFT market rebounds from the current bear market.</p><h2>How to Buy A Tom Brady NFT&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step process of how to buy Tom Brady NFT</p><p>1.

This is in contrast to traditional cryptocurrencies, which have a fixed supply determined at the time of their creation.</strong></p><p>Rebase tokens achieve price stability through a process known as a &#8220;rebase,&#8221; which is triggered at regular intervals (e.g., every 24 hours). During a rebase, the supply of the token is adjusted based on a predetermined formula.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the demand for a rebase token has increased by 10% since the last rebase, the supply of the token will automatically increase by 10%. If the demand for the token decreases, the supply will also decrease. This is meant to keep the price of the token stable even in the face of fluctuating demand.</p><h2>How Do Rebase Tokens Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So, what is a rebase cryptocurrency, and how exactly do rebase tokens work in practice?&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p><p>First, it&#8217;s essential to understand that rebase tokens are built on smart contracts. A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into its lines of code. Smart contracts further allow for the automation of specific processes, such as the adjustment of a token&#8217;s supply in response to changes in demand.</p><p>When a rebase token is created, the smart contract is programmed with a predetermined formula for adjusting the supply. This formula is typically based on the token&#8217;s target price and the current market price.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the market price of a rebase token is below the target price, the supply of the token will automatically decrease to bring the price back up to the initial target price. Conversely, if the market price is above the target price, the supply will increase.</p><p>The process of adjusting the supply is known as a &#8220;rebase.&#8221; Rebases are typically triggered at regular intervals, such as every 24 hours. When a rebase occurs, the smart contract automatically executes the predetermined formula, adjusting the token&rsquo;s supply as needed.</p><h2>Examples of Rebase Tokens</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are several examples of rebase tokens currently in circulation. Let&#8217;s take a look!</p><h3>Ampleforth&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://www.ampleforth.org/"><u>Ampleforth</u></a> (AMPL) is a cryptocurrency that was one of the first to use an elastic supply, which means that the supply of tokens is automatically adjusted to maintain a stable price. In the case of Ampleforth, the target price is $1 per token. To achieve this, the supply is adjusted through a process called a &#8220;rebase,&#8221; which occurs every 24 hours.</p><p>While Ampleforth aims to be a stablecoin, it can still be quite volatile. This is because the price of individual tokens is not the only factor to consider when evaluating the value of Ampleforth (or any other rebase crypto). Instead, it is essential to also consider the changes in supply that occur through rebasing.</p><p>One way to gauge the growth and traction of Ampleforth is to look at its market capitalization, rather than the price of individual tokens. Market capitalization is a measure of the total value of the network and can provide a more accurate picture of its overall performance.</p><p>Ampleforth gained significant traction through a <a href="https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/geyser-refresh-for-july-13-2022/549"><u>liquidity mining campaign called Geyser</u></a>, which distributes tokens to participants over a period of ten years. This demonstrates how liquidity incentives can drive adoption and growth for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) project.</p><h3>RMPL</h3><p><a href="https://www.rmpl.io/"><u>RMPL</u></a> is a cryptocurrency forked from Ampleforth and uses a similar elastic supply mechanism. However, RMPL incorporates a randomized rebasing process and has a target price of $1. This means that the supply of RMPL tokens is adjusted randomly, rather than in response to specific price movements, to maintain stability.</p><p>The rebasing period for RMPL occurs over a maximum of 48 hours and is triggered when the price rises above $1.05 or falls below $0.95.&nbsp;</p><p>By using randomized rebasing, RMPL aims to prevent price-fixing and maintain a stable price for its tokens. It is designed to be a stable store of value for decentralized applications (dApps) and a medium of exchange for peer-to-peer transactions.</p><h3>YAM Finance</h3><p><a href="https://yam.finance/"><u>Yam Finance</u></a> is a cryptocurrency that uses an elastic supply mechanism similar to Ampleforth&rsquo;s. It also incorporates elements of staking and a fair launch. The goal of Yam is to maintain a stable price of $1 per token.</p><p>One unique aspect of Yam is that it is community-owned and was distributed through <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/yield-farming-liquidity-mining-staking-and-their-risks.htm">liquidity mining</a>. This means there was no pre-mine or founder allocation, and all participants had an equal opportunity to acquire tokens through a yield farming scheme.</p><p>Despite being a relatively new and unknown project, Yam quickly gained traction and achieved $600 million in value locked in its staking pools within two days of its launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, a bug in the rebasing mechanism caused more supply to be minted than intended, leading to the need for a community-funded audit and a relaunch of the project on a new token contract. The future of Yam is now in the hands of its holders.</p><h2>Merits and Demerits of Rebase Tokens</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Just like any innovation, <strong>rebase tokens have some merits and demerits</strong>, some of which we highlight below.</p><h3>Merits of Rebase Tokens&nbsp;</h3><p>So, what are the potential benefits of using rebase tokens? Here are a few key points to consider.</p><ul><li><strong>Price stability: </strong>The primary advantage of rebase tokens is their ability to maintain price stability. By automatically adjusting the supply in response to changes in demand, rebase tokens can keep their price relatively stable, even in volatile market conditions. This can be appealing to those who want to use cryptocurrency as a means of exchange or as a store of value.</li><li><strong>Decentralization: </strong>Rebase tokens are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity. This makes them less vulnerable to manipulation and more resistant to censorship.</li><li><strong>Potential for increased adoption:</strong> By offering a stable price, rebase tokens could potentially be more appealing to merchants and consumers who are hesitant to use traditional cryptocurrencies due to their volatility. This could lead to increased adoption and use of rebase tokens, potentially driving up demand and value.</li></ul><h3>Demerits of Rebase Tokens</h3><p>While rebase tokens have some potential benefits, they also have some drawbacks that should be considered.</p><ul><li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Rebase tokens are complex, both in terms of their underlying technology and how they function. This can make them difficult for some users to understand and use.</li><li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Despite their aim to maintain price stability, rebase tokens are not immune to volatility. The price of rebase tokens can still fluctuate significantly, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to maintain a stable price over the long term.</li><li><strong>Risk of failure:</strong> As with any cryptocurrency, there is always a risk that a rebase token could fail. This could be due to various factors, such as technical issues, security vulnerabilities, or a lack of adoption.</li></ul><h2>Should Rebase Tokens Be In Your Crypto Portfolio?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As with any investment, it&#8217;s essential to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before investing in any cryptocurrency. While rebase tokens have some unique characteristics that could make them a compelling investment for some, it&#8217;s also important to be aware of the potential risks.</p><p>One potential risk to consider is that rebase tokens are a relatively new and untested concept in the world of cryptocurrency. This means that there is a higher degree of uncertainty surrounding their long-term prospects, and it&#8217;s possible that they could fail or not live up to their potential.</p><p>That being said, rebase tokens could potentially provide a valuable tool for traders and investors looking to hedge against the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In the end, whether or not rebase tokens should be in your portfolio or not will depend on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and overall investment strategy. As with any investment, it&#8217;s essential to do your research and carefully consider all the potential risks and rewards before making a decision.<br>&nbsp;</p>

But Axie Infinity is also more than just a game, as gamers have been able to earn an income by playing the game.&nbsp;</p><p>In this beginner&rsquo;s guide to Axie, we will answer what Axie Infinity is, how to play Axie Infinity, what Axies are, and how you can potentially make some money playing the game.</p><h2>What Is Axie Infinity?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>Axie Infinity is a P2E, NFT-powered game built on the Ethereum blockchain by Sky Mavis. Sky Mavis is a blockchain development company focusing on creating games that shift the ownership of in-game ecosystems from companies to gamers.&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>As a Pokemon-inspired online game, Axie Infinity allows players to collect Axies, virtual creatures represented as non-fungible tokens.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Axie Infinity was launched in March 2018 after Sky Mavis raised capital from noteworthy investors such as Blocktower Capital, Libertus, and Marck Cuban. Axie Infinity resembles the Pokemon games. However, unlike Pokemon games, the Axie Infinity game involves <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm"><strong>NFTs</strong></a>. The incorporation of NFTs in the game gives gamers full ownership of their Axies and allows them to monetize the characters.&nbsp;</p><p>To play the game, gamers have two options &#8211; borrow three Axies or purchase them from the in-house marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Opting to purchase an Axie would mean buying an Axie that another player has bred. This brings out the monetizing aspect of the Axie Infinity game. Axie Infinity is arguably one of the most popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm"><strong>blockchain</strong></a> games in the market today. The game&#8217;s popularity saw it raise $7.5 million in its Series A funding round, later followed by a $150 million Series B raise. Axie Infinity also has some significant partnerships with companies like Samsung and UBISOFT.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s now take a closer look at Axie Infinity&rsquo;s Axies.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is an Axie?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>An Axie is the main character in the Axie Infinity game. <strong>Axies are represented in the form of NFTs and have unique traits and capabilities</strong>, which we will discuss below. Players can buy Axies in the in-game marketplace and breed/grow them. Additionally, players can also sell their Axies. The price of an Axie is mainly dependent on its rarity.&nbsp;</p><p>Each Axie features a unique set of stats that can be categorized into four base statistics.</p><ul><li><strong>Health (HP)</strong> represents the life energy cycle of each Axie. It&rsquo;s your Axie&rsquo;s health that will enable it to withstand any damage from your competitors. The more HP your Axie has, the longer it can last during combat.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Morale</strong> &#8211; your Axie&rsquo;s morale helps it to increase the damage it can cause to your competitor&rsquo;s defense power during gameplay. It also helps to extend life after the Health (HP) of your Axie is exhausted.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Skill</strong> &#8211; this stat helps boost the bonus damage that an Axie can cause.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> &#8211; Axies with more speed take the first turn in any game until they are defeated. If, however, all your Axies have the same speed point, Health, Skill point, Morale point, and ID will determine the turn orders.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>9 Different Classes of Axies</h3><p>Besides the stats, Axies also have different characteristics. One such characteristic of each Axie is the base class. The base class is a set of weakness detail and stat points for each Axie, making it necessary to choose your Axies well before starting a game.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are nine different Axie classes that you can choose from.</p><ul><li><strong>Plant</strong> &#8211; this class of Axie is known to have high HP stats and the capacity to absorb significant amounts of damage. In addition, they have auxiliary defense points and can obtain energy by themselves. On the downside, they have low-speed points and damage in comparison to other Axie classes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Reptile</strong> &#8211; Axies in this class have high HP, second to Plants, and have more attacking damage. They can also return damage from competitors. However, they have low-speed and low damage.</li><li><strong>Dusk</strong> &#8211; Dusk Axies have the highest speed point. It has more life points and attacking damage stats which are well-balanced, thus making them excellent for long fights as it can endure more attacks. The downside, however, is that they are pricey, given their traits.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Beast</strong> &#8211; an Axie in this class has double the critical strike chance compared to other Axies&rsquo; in other classes, which helps to boost its potential. It, however, has a low health stat and requires additional combo cards to prolong its critical strikes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bug</strong> &#8211; Bug Axies have turn-confusing abilities. This means they can quickly and frequently reach their Last Stand. Even so, their HP, attack damage, and speed point are below average.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mech</strong> &#8211; this class of Axie has high-speed and destructive attacking power that gets doubled by combo damage. Nonetheless, it has a low morale stat making it challenging to achieve Last Stand.</li><li><strong>Aquatic</strong> &#8211; features awesome life points, and its damage is above average. Like Mech, it has a low morale point which means its probability of striking a critical strike and obtaining Last Stand is very low.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bird</strong> &#8211; a Bird Axie, compared to other classes, can achieve the highest speed plus the most assault damage. It, however, has limited health points and low defense power.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Dawn</strong> &#8211; Dawn Axies are known to cause substantial harm, especially when a combo attack is used. Still, they have low-speed power.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Breeding Axies</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A key feature in the Axie Infinity ecosystem is breeding. Breeding allows gamers to get new offspring with the characteristics they want, such as classes. For you to breed an Axie, you will need two Axies to hatch an egg, then wait for five days for the new Axie to be born.&nbsp;</p><p>Breeding a new Axie will cost you both AXS and SLP tokens. The amount, however, is dependent on the breeding events that an Axie has.&nbsp;</p><p>To breed an Axie:</p><ul><li>Go to your &lsquo;Inventory&rsquo; and choose the first Axie that you want to breed and select &lsquo;Breed.&rsquo;</li><li>Proceed to choose another Axie you want to breed with and click on &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Breed&rsquo;.&nbsp;</li><li>Await a confirmed transaction notification, then click &lsquo;Confirm&rsquo; to go to the next step.</li><li>Once breeding is completed, an Axie egg will be received in your &lsquo;Inventory&rsquo;.&nbsp;</li><li>It will take five days for the new Axie to be born. Once born, click on &lsquo;Morph to Adult&rsquo;.</li></ul><p>And that&rsquo;s it,&nbsp;you now have your new Axie.&nbsp;</p><h2>Axie Infinity&rsquo;s Tokens</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Axie Infinity players utilize two coins in the game&rsquo;s ecosystem &#8211; <strong>Axie Infinity Shard (AXS)</strong> and <strong>Small Love Potion (SLP)</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The SLP token is used to reward players who win every battle, while the AXS token is used to reward the best players from all of Axie Infinity&rsquo;s 19 seasons. The AXS tokens have a limited supply, and their demand is driven by their utility within the Axie Infinity ecosystem. On the other hand, SLP tokens have an unlimited supply. However, gamers are still able to swap their SLP tokens for AXS.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we know all about Axies, how to breed them, and how the economy works, let&rsquo;s take a look at how you can start playing Axie Infinity below.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Play Axie Infinity</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>If you&rsquo;ve been wondering how to play Axie Infinity, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve got you covered.

In Adventure mode, gamers have to fight and win against various monsters that are in all 36 levels of the game. Additionally, you can earn around 50 SLPs each day doing this. In Arena mode, on the other hand, gamers have to compete against other gamers&rsquo; Axies. Players also receive SLP based on their Matchmaking Rating (MMR). Should you, as a gamer, emerge with the highest MMR, you will get 21 SLPs for each win.&nbsp;</p><p>However, before you can join any mode, you will need to have energy. Your energy is also dependent on the Axies you own.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/101285/250084/image1.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/101285/250084/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_1999_1333.jpg 1999w, https://cimg.co/news/101285/250084/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_1200_800.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/101285/250084/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_900_600.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/101285/250084/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/101285/250084/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/101285/250084/responsive-images/image1___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1999" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Players also have the option to earn SLPs through &lsquo;Farming.&rsquo; In Axie Infinity, farming means completing various tasks daily to earn rewards which are paid out in SLPs.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s how to play Axie Infinity.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Can You Make Money Playing Axie?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are different ways that gamers can make money playing Axie Infinity. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p><h3>Breeding Axies to Sell</h3><p>One sure way players can make money in the Axie Infinity ecosystem is by breeding Axies for sale or for rent. Here, you can breed two Axies and get a newborn Axie with the traits of both parents. Remember, the more superior and rare your Axie is, the more money you can make off it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Farming SLPs</h3><p>Players can also make money on the Axie Infinity universe by farming SLPs. Players can farm SLPs by battling monsters in Adventure mode, fighting other players in Arena mode, or completing the daily quests.&nbsp;</p><h3>Flipping Land&nbsp;</h3><p>Axie Infinity&rsquo;s virtual land is known as Lunacia. Lunacia features customizable plots of land that are tokenized. These plots of land also serve as residences for Axies. If you own a plot of land on Lunacia, you can rent it out to other players at a fee or opt to sell it at a profit to another gamer.&nbsp;</p><h3>Selling SLPs</h3><p>Selling or trading Smooth Love Potion (SLP) in the Marketplace is another sure way to earn money on Axie Infinity.</p><h3>Staking AXS Tokens&nbsp;</h3><p>The Axie Infinity Shard token has various uses in the Axie Infinity ecosystem. AXS is the native token for the Axie Infinity universe and also doubles up as its governance token. Players are able to stake AXS &#8211; lock AXS tokens at a given interest rate for a duration of time &#8211; and in return, earn rewards.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Much Money Can You Make Playing Axie Infinity?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Various factors will determine the amount of money that you can make playing Axie Infinity. These factors include how often you play, how experienced you are in the game, and the traits that your Axies have.&nbsp;</p><p>Players have been seen to earn anywhere between $10 &#8211; $50 per day while playing the game.&nbsp;</p><h2>Are Axie Infinity Tokens (AXS) a Good Investment?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Axie Infinity&rsquo;s native token, AXS, shot up from $0.43 in December 2021 to reach $158.41 in November 2021 thanks to the 2021 crypto bull run and increased interest in crypto assets. However, AXS, like other cryptocurrencies, experienced significant price drops due to the crypto winter that started in early 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that AXS is a digital asset like any other, it&rsquo;s highly volatile, underlining its riskiness. As such, whether AXS is a good investment or not, all boils down to your investment risk appetite, and whether you believe that play-to-earn blockchain games will have a bright future.&nbsp;</p>

However, it recently made a comeback after about 60 years, thanks to the birth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).&nbsp;</p><p>Read on to learn about generative art, how they made their way into the NFT space, and discover some of the most popular generative NFT art collections in the market today.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Generative Art?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>Generative art is a term used to refer to art that is created using software. The program randomly creates shapes, patterns, and colors that are arranged into an artistically enjoyable piece of digital art.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Typically, the artist defines the process, and the resulting piece of art is generated by the software or program of choice, making it a collaborative effort between man and machine.</p><blockquote><p>For art to be described as generative, it has to have three elements: algorithms, geometry, and randomness.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>If the art isn&rsquo;t randomly generated, it would mean that the artist has decided upon it in advance, and it, therefore, it would not count as generative art. Furthermore, the combination of algorithms and geometry helps to develop amazing art while also offering beautiful visual effects.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative art has its origins dating back to the 1960s. This was way before the internet or blockchain. Gradually, generative art grew into an art genre. Back then, terms such as algorithmic art, computer art, and computer graphics were used to describe this &lsquo;new&rsquo; artistic method.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, algorithmic art and generative art are sometimes used interchangeably depending on the context. However, the 1960s was also a period where countless art concepts and styles emerged, such as Conceptual Art, Feminist Art, Pop Art, etc., and thus generative art sort of took a back burner.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, however, generative art made a comeback after finding a new home in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-get-started-with-nfts-a-beginners-guide.htm"><strong>NFTs</strong></a>, enabling a range of new artists to make money selling algorithmic art.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Are Generative Art NFTs?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>A generative art NFT is a type of generative art that utilizes a smart contract in the creation process and is stored on a blockchain as an NFT.</strong></p><p>While non-fungible tokens started having a steady rise in 2017, it wasn&rsquo;t until 2021 that their sales spiked to reach <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/nft-sales-hit-25-billion-2021-growth-shows-signs-slowing-2022-01-10/"><u>$25 billion</u></a>. And even with the 2022 crypto winter and the collapse of various crypto exchanges, NFTs continued to sell, generating sales of <a href="https://decrypt.co/118438/2022-versus-2021-nft-sales"><u>$24.7 billion</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the continued growth of NFTs, generative art NFTs have now become a sought-after form of NFT art. People can easily collect and own a piece of generative art thanks to NFTs.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, generative art NFTs&#8217; popularity has now caught the attention of both art collectors and enthusiasts alike. This could potentially help to boost the overall generative art market.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Are Generative Art NFTs Created?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/100430/248480/javier-miranda-mrwocgkfvdg-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/100430/248480/responsive-images/javier-miranda-mrwocgkfvdg-unsplash___media_library_original_1920_1459.jpg 1920w, https://cimg.co/news/100430/248480/responsive-images/javier-miranda-mrwocgkfvdg-unsplash___media_library_original_1200_912.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/100430/248480/responsive-images/javier-miranda-mrwocgkfvdg-unsplash___media_library_original_900_684.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/100430/248480/responsive-images/javier-miranda-mrwocgkfvdg-unsplash___media_library_original_720_547.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/100430/248480/responsive-images/javier-miranda-mrwocgkfvdg-unsplash___media_library_original_600_456.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/100430/248480/responsive-images/javier-miranda-mrwocgkfvdg-unsplash___media_library_original_300_228.jpg 300w" width="1920" class="content-img" alt=""><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/MrWOCGKFVDg">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Generative art NFTs are created through the use of smart contracts and then stored on a blockchain in the form of an NFT.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm"><strong>smart contract</strong></a> is a piece of code that is secured on a blockchain and self-executes when the predetermined conditions are met. This trait makes them perfect for creating art that is both random and algorithm-driven.&nbsp;</p><p>As an artist looking to create generative art NFT, you can first find an AI tool and relevant blockchain that would help you create your art. Then, you will establish a series of traits that make up your NFT and then design one or several variations for each trait. Proceed to copy smart scripts into your NFT design to create new variations of NFTs. You can also place a limit on the total number of NFTs that can be generated.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, artists can make their pieces of art more unique by minting the generative art NFT. Depending on what you want to achieve as an artist, you can add different codes to your art, such as wallet ID, transaction ID, or gas price.&nbsp;</p><p>The inception of AI-generative NFTs has opened up a whole new world for artists, which allows them to work with machines and create unique pieces of art. In fact, there are lots of resources, software, tools, and tutorials available in the market that artists can use to create generative art NFTs. However, the complexity and functionality of your generative art NFT will determine, for example, the software you opt for.&nbsp;</p><p>Below is a list of a few programs and resources that are currently used in creating generative art NFTs by various creators:</p><ul><li><a href="https://async.art/"><strong>Async Art</strong></a> is a powerful and popular software for artists, brands, and musicians interested in creating generative art without the use of code on the Ethereum blockchain. Artists are able to use this software to upload their NFT assets, create a whole generative art NFT collection, and set the rarity percentages for them.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch"><strong>canvas-sketch</strong></a> is a loose collection of modules, resources, and tools for developing generative art on the browser and in JavaScript.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/"><strong>DALL.E 2</strong></a> is a new AI system that has the ability to create realistic art and images from a description in natural language.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://openframeworks.cc/"><strong>openFrameworks</strong></a> is an open-source C++ tool that helps in the facilitation of fast and efficient algorithmic and generative art.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://sketchar.io/"><strong>SketchAr</strong></a> is a mobile application used in the creation and selling of NFT art. Using the app, artists are able to create, explore and sell their NFT artwork.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Most, if not all, programming languages can be utilized in the creation of generative art. In fact, most artists prefer using JavaScript. However, there is various software that exists and can be used to create generative art, with or without the need to code.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top Generative Art NFTs Collections</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Now that we know what generative art and generative art NFTs are and how they are created, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the top generative art NFT collections created to date.</p><h3>Autoglyphs</h3><p><a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs"><strong>Autoglyphs</strong></a> is known as the first generative NFT art project created on-chain in 2019 by Larva Labs, the creators of CryptoPunks.&nbsp;</p><p>According to its developers, Autoglyphs are &ldquo;an experiment in generative art, each one unique and created by code&rdquo; running on the Ethereum <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain</a>. Larva Labs made it possible for anyone that paid around $35 to generate their own Autoglyph. The entire collection has 512 glyphs, which have all been created. The most expensive Autoglyph NFT is worth $941,428, and it&rsquo;s estimated that the entire collection reached a total sales volume of $41 million.&nbsp;</p><h3>Art Blocks</h3><p><a href="https://www.artblocks.io/"><strong>Art Blocks</strong></a> is a platform that&rsquo;s used for curating and creating generative art. Launched in 2020 by Erick Calderon, the project is ranked as the most successful generative art NFT project, having achieved a sales volume of more than $994 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromie Squiggles was the first-ever generative art NFT minted on Art Blocks by Calderon himself. Besides Chromie Squiggles #4697, Ringers #109, Ringers #879. Fidenza #313 and Fidenza #77 are some of the highest-priced art NFTs on Art Blocks.&nbsp;</p><h3>Lost Poets</h3><p><a href="https://lostpoets.xyz/"><strong>Lost Poets</strong></a> is a piece of generative art NFT and strategy game created by Pak, known as one of the most popular and successful NFT artists at the time of writing. The Lost Poets project is a multi-stage NFT collectible and strategy game and is revered as Pak&rsquo;s most in-depth NFT project.&nbsp;</p><p>Launched in September 2021, Lost Poets&rsquo; release comprises several stages. The first phase, known as &lsquo;Pages,&rsquo; was made up of 65,536 single, multi-edition NFTs and went ahead to achieve a sales volume of $70 million, with more stages coming after. Each NFT in the collection was AI-generated.&nbsp;</p><h3>Solvency&nbsp;</h3><p>Created by Ezra Miller, the <a href="https://www.solvency.art/"><strong>Solvency</strong></a> project is a limited edition collection that features WebGL simulations.&nbsp;</p><p>The WebGL artwork is developed using textured feedback loops that are derived from a GAN trained on 35 mm photographs coupled with layered colors that are dependent on details from the minting transaction and contain 500 editions of artworks. The hash of the token used in the Solvency project influences the final piece of art, with some being rarer than others.&nbsp;</p><h2>Are Generative Art NFTs Worth Collecting?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The decision on whether to collect generative art NFTs or not boils down to your personal preference and end goal.&nbsp;</p><p>Although generative art has been in existence for decades, the incorporation of NFTs into generative art makes it a relatively new space. And just like with any new technology, it&rsquo;s hard to tell whether the generative art NFT market will perform a few years down the line.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021 alone, the generative art NFT market generated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1299636/sales-value-art-and-collectibles-nfts-worldwide/"><u>$2.57 billion dollars</u></a>, up from $20 million in 2020. This growth is an indication that generative art NFTs could potentially blow up if the market managed to continue to experience an upward trajectory despite the ongoing crypto winter. &nbsp;</p><p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no denying that it might take a while before generative art NFTs achieve some of the success that certain NFT projects have achieved so far.&nbsp;</p><p>But even with all the hype and the potential gains investors can make collecting generative art NFTs, you shouldn&#8217;t go at it blindly. Consider market trends, do your own research and only spend what you can afford to lose because NFTs are a highly speculate asset class.</p>

One such dog-themed crypto project that has at least followed in Dogecoin&rsquo;s shoes is the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token, which, in 2021, made many holders crypto millionaires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its success, Shiba Inu bears a faint resemblance to Dogecoin because of ShibaSwap &#8211; a decentralized trading ecosystem developed off the Shiba Inu coin. <strong>But what exactly is ShibaSwap, and how does it work?</strong></p><p>In this guide, we&rsquo;ll take a look at what ShibaSwap is, how it works, and what you expect to find on it.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Shiba Inu?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based dog-themed meme coin that features the Japanese breed of hunting dog, Shiba Inu, whom it&rsquo;s named after as its mascot and has SHIB as its native token.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>SHIB is also touted as the &lsquo;Dogecoin killer&rsquo; and an alternative to Dogecoin for meme coin enthusiasts. In much simpler terms, Shibu Inu is a cryptocurrency that is associated with a meme &#8211; in this case, the Shiba Inu dog &#8211; and is usually released as an inside joke instead of an actual digital currency that has some utility attached to it.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiba Inu was developed in August 2020 by an anonymous group or individual under the pseudonym Ryoshi. It quickly gained momentum and value, witnessing a string of investors who were drawn to it by the cute charm of the coin, receiving tweets from the likes of Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin, which further spurred it into mainstream media and made it a sought-after investment by investors. In late October 2021, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s price shot more than tenfold, making it reach a market capitalization of $41 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the current crypto winter has affected meme cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu, some believe that the Dogecoin clone could still turn out to be a good <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-shiba-inu-a-good-investment.htm"><u>long-term crypto investment</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is ShibaSwap?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>ShibaSwap is a decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) that evolved off the Shiba Inu ecosystem.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As a decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap makes it possible for users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a third party or any intermediary. This means all the transactions carried out on ShibaSwap are done on a peer-to-peer basis. Furthermore, with ShibaSwap, you get to enjoy an environment that is more private and secure for you to carry out your digital asset transaction in comparison to when using centralized exchanges (CEXs).&nbsp;</p><p>ShibaSwap offers many of the functionalities that are offered by other modern decentralized exchanges such as PancakeSwap and Uniswap, including but not limited to governance, liquidity pools, non-custodial digital currency swaps, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, staking, and yield farming.&nbsp;</p><p>ShibaSwap is built atop the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> network and was launched on July 6, 2021. The ShibaSwap decentralized exchange utilizes the Shiba Inu coin that goes with the ticker (SHIB), along with two secondary tokens known as Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) and Doge Killer (LEASH), but more on what these tokens do later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>How Does ShibaSwap Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/99775/247202/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d4oom-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/99775/247202/responsive-images/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d4oom-unsplash___media_library_original_1920_1080.jpg 1920w, https://cimg.co/news/99775/247202/responsive-images/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d4oom-unsplash___media_library_original_1200_675.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/99775/247202/responsive-images/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d4oom-unsplash___media_library_original_900_506.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/99775/247202/responsive-images/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d4oom-unsplash___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/99775/247202/responsive-images/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d4oom-unsplash___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/99775/247202/responsive-images/ferhat-deniz-fors-yocdd-d4oom-unsplash___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w" width="1920" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>ShibaSwap works by offering multiple functionalities that incorporate its three tokens. Users can earn rewards in the ShibaSwap ecosystem through four main channels: Dig, Woof, Bury, and Swap.&nbsp;</p><h3>Dig</h3><p>The Dig function is ShibaSwap&rsquo;s liquidity pool function. Users using the Dig function are able to deposit asset pairs to the existing liquidity pools on ShibaSwap. This way, the DEX always has enough liqudity to carry out transactions. Liquidity providers on ShibaSwap get compensated with ShibaSwap Liquidity Pool (SSLP) tokens. SSLP token holders are then able to redeem BONE tokens for free whenever they want to.&nbsp;</p><h3>Woof</h3><p>The second functionality on ShibaSwap, Woof, allows users to earn rewards on the DEX known as Woof. The Woof function is more or less a yield farm pool that offers users the ability to exchange their BONE rewards by swapping their SSLP tokens. Please note that whatever BONE rewards you swap with your SSLP tokens, you will only be able to immediately claim 33% of the rewards, while the other 67% will remain locked for a period of six months.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bury</h3><p>Bury, which is the third function, allows users to stake their BONE, LEASH, or SHIB tokens into the DEX&rsquo;s Bury function so as to earn high-interest rates. Depending on the type of token you stake, you will receive tBONE, xLEASH, or xSHIB. And similar to Woof, only 33% of the rewards can be claimed, with the rest staying locked up.&nbsp;</p><h3>Burn Portal</h3><p>ShibaSwap&rsquo;s fourth functionality is its Burn Portal which is similar to BNB&rsquo;s burning mechanism. The newly introduced Burn Portal helps ShibaSwap to permanently remove the SHIB token by &lsquo;burning&rsquo; it.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>ShibaSwap&rsquo;s burning process requires SHIB holders to send the token to a dead wallet. Users who burn their SHIB tokens get rewarded with RYOSHI tokens.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Besides the four main functionalities of the DEX, ShibaSwap also has other functions, such as Swap, Doggy DAO, NFT, and Bonefolio. The swapping mechanism allows users to swap or exchange tokens for other tokens. Moreover, users can also exchange a single asset for several other assets based on their value. Doggy DAO, as earlier mentioned, is the governance system that runs the ShibaSwap ecosystem. Users are able to vote on various issues and get a stake in the Woof liquidity pool.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the NFT function, ShibaSwap has its own NFTs known as Shiboshis, which are part of ShibaSwap&rsquo;s gaming project dubbed the Shiboshi Game.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides varying in nature, value, and rarity, the Shiboshis can also be customized by their holders. Lastly, ShibaSwap&rsquo;s analytics page is known as Bonefolio. The page includes historical data on return on investment (ROI) info, staking data, trading data, and transaction fees. Users can also utilize the Bonefolio function to keep track of their yield rewards.&nbsp;</p><h2>The ShibaSwap Ecosystem Tokens&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The ShibaSwap exchange has three tokens that help it to carry out various roles in the ecosystem. This way, ShibaSwap is able to create an ecosystem that is liquid, profitable, and secure.&nbsp;</p><h3>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h3><p>As mentioned, Shiba Inu is the native token of the ShibaSwap ecosystem. In other words, it&rsquo;s the heart of ShibaSwap. It&rsquo;s a popular meme coin in the crypto space and is also an ERC-20 token.&nbsp;</p><p>SHIB currently has a circulating supply of over $549 trillion and always ranks in the top five list of meme cryptocurrencies, right behind Dogecoin, and is currently the 15th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, SHIB had close to 1 quadrillion authorized tokens. However, in May 2021, 40% of the coins were burned by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum&rsquo;s Co-Founder. Buterin had received the coins in his cold wallet, having been sent to him by Ryoshi for reasons that weren&rsquo;t known.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bone (BONE)</h3><p>BONE, besides being an ERC-20 token, is also a key part of ShibaSwap as it works as the DEX&rsquo;s governance token. This means that BONE holders are able to have a say and propose changes to the ShibaSwap protocol via the Shiba Inu Doggy decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).&nbsp;</p><p>In a nutshell, the more BONE tokens you have, the more weight your vote has on future ShibaSwap decisions. The token is also used to reward liquidity providers on the DEX and can be staked.&nbsp;</p><p>The token was launched in July 2021 with a maximum supply of 230 million tokens. As of this writing, BONE has a circulating supply of over 160 million and a fully diluted market cap of over $170 million. Also, a portion of any newly minted BONE is distributed to a developer wallet to help fund ShibaSwap&rsquo;s future development.&nbsp;</p><h3>Doge Killer (LEASH)</h3><p>LEASH is also another ERC-20 token, similar to BONE. The token was launched in April 2021 and was designed to &lsquo;tame DOGE,&rsquo; thus the name. It was built as a rebase token that would &lsquo;tame DOGE&rsquo; by being pegged in a 1:1000 ratio to DOGE prices. Rebase tokens are akin to stablecoins, and their supply is automatically altered via an algorithm that keeps their price pegged on the respective asset. LEASH&rsquo;s price rebasing was done daily at 6:30 UTC.&nbsp;</p><p>LEASH&rsquo;s price was, however, de-pegged from DOGE and instituted as a rare ERC-20 token with a total supply of 107,647. The token&rsquo;s current supply is reported to be at 107,647, and its market capitalization is over $31 million. Because of its scarcity, a single LEASH coin costs upwards of $250. The de-pegging from DOGE also means that the token is priced as per the supply and demand mechanisms, and it can be staked. Unlike most tokens where you stake it and earn the same token, users who stake LEASH earn BONE tokens instead.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is ShibaSwap Safe?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As a decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap isn&rsquo;t subject to similar regulations that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">centralized exchanges</a> are subjected to, which can make it safer than traditional trading platforms as there is no single entity that holds your funds. Moreover, the exchange&#8217;s code has been audited, suggesting it could be a safe platform to trade.&nbsp;</p><p>ShibaSwap has a <a href="https://www.certik.com/projects/shib"><u>security score</u></a> of 92/100, according to a security score done by CertiK, a blockchain-based security audit company. In addition, the DEX platform has resolved 34 issues that were raised during its audit. This translates to 97% of the issues brought up, which helps ShibaSwap to rank at the top when it comes to decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p>While ShibaSwap seems to be doing well for itself, the decision on whether to use the platform to trade is entirely up to you. The same goes for investing in any of the tokens for sale within the ShibaSwap ecosystem. Always conduct your own research before connecting to a dApp and, even more so, before clicking the buy button on a cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

But how long can this power last, and can bitcoin fix today&rsquo;s system called the petrodollar system?&nbsp;</p><p>This guide will explore the petrodollar system, how it was established, how it&rsquo;s been challenged, and how bitcoin could fix it.</p><h2>What Is the Petrodollar System?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>The petrodollar system refers to the global practice of trading oil for US dollars. Oil-importing countries pay oil-producing countries in dollars, which is why this arrangement is referred to as the petrodollar trade.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The system originated from a 1970s agreement where it was agreed that the US would provide weapons to Saudi Arabia, and in return, the latter would carry out crude oil sales in USD. Following this, the petrodollar system was established and,&nbsp;today, applies to members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Middle Eastern countries, and other nations that export oil.</p><h2>The History of the Petrodollar System</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Before the petrodollar system was established, Allied nations (an alliance of 44 nations) <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/bretton-woods-system-and-1944-agreement-3306133"><u>entered</u></a> into the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944. The agreement allowed countries to fix the exchange rates of their currencies to USD, giving them a chance to gradually shift from the gold to the dollar standard.</p><p>The US dollar was chosen because the United States had the largest gold stock in the world. Hence, no other country had enough gold to back its own currency. This meant that the global financial became centered around the dollar, while the dollar was pegged to gold.&nbsp;</p><p>Central banks and foreign governments were also guaranteed the ability to convert dollars into gold. The dollar&rsquo;s value was $35 for every ounce of gold. The allied nations also formed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to make world currencies stable, as well as the World Bank to help emerging markets.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the demand for dollars was growing, but, as became increasingly the case, the backing commodity, gold, was not keeping up. This pushed inflation up in the late 60s,&nbsp;putting downward pressure on the dollar&rsquo;s value. At the same time, the United States suffered from unemployment and poor economic growth. Moreover, central banks across the globe started exchanging their dollar reserves for gold since the value of the dollar was plummeting.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to the oversupply of dollars, Richard Nixon adjusted the dollar&rsquo;s value to $38 per ounce of gold, but this didn&rsquo;t work. As a result, he had no choice but to stop backing the dollar with gold. This took place in 1971, when Nixon closed the so-called gold window. With it, he also ended the nations&rsquo; ability to exchange dollars for gold with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Bretton system coming to an end, Nixon had to find a solution to find a new &ldquo;backing&rdquo; that would safeguard the dollar&rsquo;s value from further decline. So, he made a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret"><u>deal</u></a> with Saudi Arabia in 1974. The terms of the deal were that Saudi Arabia would sell oil in dollars. In return, the US would give the kingdom military aid and weapons for its oil fields. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia would reinvest its dollar profits into the US by buying US treasury bills and bonds. Hence, this deal has allowed Saudi Arabia to become one of the largest creditors to the US.</p><p>Afterward, other oil-producing countries adopted the petrodollar system, enabling them to export oil in USD. Today, the dollar contributes significantly to the international economy because of its use in the oil and gas markets. Hence, most central banks hold the dollar as a reserve because the dollar has turned into the international reserve and trade currency.</p><h2>Countries That Have Challenged the Petrodollar System</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/98463/244748/rob-esj7pzsoq38-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/98463/244748/responsive-images/rob-esj7pzsoq38-unsplash___media_library_original_1920_1277.jpg 1920w, https://cimg.co/news/98463/244748/responsive-images/rob-esj7pzsoq38-unsplash___media_library_original_1200_798.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/98463/244748/responsive-images/rob-esj7pzsoq38-unsplash___media_library_original_900_599.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/98463/244748/responsive-images/rob-esj7pzsoq38-unsplash___media_library_original_720_479.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/98463/244748/responsive-images/rob-esj7pzsoq38-unsplash___media_library_original_600_399.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/98463/244748/responsive-images/rob-esj7pzsoq38-unsplash___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w" width="1920" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>While petrodollars have been used as payment for oil over the years, countries like Russia and China are now challenging this system.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, Russia wants to denominate its commodity sales in another currency that is not the US dollar. Preferably in its own currency, the rubel. Moreover, the central bank of Russia has also been buying gold, diversifying away from the US dollar. There is also some speculation that bitcoin could play a part.</p><p>On the other hand, China wants to replace the USD with a petroyuan. As a matter of fact, China has been in talks with Saudi Arabia to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-considers-accepting-yuan-instead-of-dollars-for-chinese-oil-sales-11647351541"><u>price</u></a> its oil sales to China in yuan. These talks have been on and off for years but are gaining momentum as Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s unhappiness with the US increases. The Middle Eastern country is angry due to the failure of the US to support them in their intervention in Yemen&rsquo;s civil war. China&rsquo;s yuan could get a major boost if these talks prove to be successful, especially since China buys over 25% of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s oil exports.&nbsp;</p><p>Russia and China have reportedly been accumulating gold in recent years, thereby putting them on the top ten <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-nations-have-been-buying-gold"><u>list</u></a> of countries with the largest gold reserves. In 2017, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) <a href="https://www.ine.cn/en/news/news/517.html"><u>introduced</u></a> crude oil futures contracts denominated in yuan. These contracts allow oil producers to exchange yuan for physical gold.&nbsp;</p><p>Libya has also challenged the petrodollar system in the past. African countries should have been encouraged to purchase African oil using the Libyan dinar and silver dirham under the leadership of al-Qadhafi. These plans didn&rsquo;t come to fruition, though, due to the US/NATO invasion of Libya that started in 2011.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Libya&#8217;s Qadhafi (African Union 2009 Chair) conceived and financed a plan to unify the sovereign States of Africa with one gold currency (United States of Africa). [&#8230;] African oil-producing nations were planning to abandon the petrodollar, and demand gold payment for oil/gas,&#8221; Denise Rhyne <a href="https://theecologist.org/2016/mar/14/why-qaddafi-had-go-african-gold-oil-and-challenge-monetary-imperialism"><u>wrote</u></a> in a blog.</p></blockquote><p>Conversely, Iraq&rsquo;s oil exports were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/16/iraq.theeuro"><u>paid</u></a> for in euros in the early 2000s under Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s leadership. This was followed by a regime change after Hussein was <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/29/middleeast/iraqi-voices-saddam-execution/index.html"><u>captured</u></a> by a US-led coalition in 2003. Hussein was executed in 2006.</p><h2>How Does the Petrodollar System Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Oil is a precious commodity that every country needs. For almost 50 years, every oil importer has needed US dollars to pay for oil imports, giving them a reason to hold the currency in large quantities.&nbsp;</p><p>This demand has been naturally strengthening the value of the dollar.&nbsp;</p><p>Oil-producing nations may find themselves with a surplus of dollars after selling oil. This creates a chance for them to &ldquo;recycle&rdquo; the petrodollars by investing them. As it stands, a lot of dollars held as a surplus find their way into US-dollar-denominated assets, most often US treasury assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As such, the petrodollar system has made the market for the dollar and US treasuries more liquid while enabling the US government to artificially maintain low-interest rates and financing large fiscal deficits.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that <strong>the petrodollar system is crucial to the economy of the US, which is why the nation seems to be keen on protecting it.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>The Future of the Petrodollar System</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The petrodollar has served the United States well for decades. Here are the benefits the country has reaped:</p><ul><li>The ability to fund fiscal deficits at low-interest rates.</li><li>Enormous influence over the entire global financial market.</li><li>A regular source of liquidity.</li><li>A flow of foreign capital via the &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; of petrodollars.</li><li>Consistent trade deficits &mdash; a country runs a trade deficit when it imports more than it exports. A trade deficit could be a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/051515/pros-cons-trade-deficit.asp"><u>sign</u></a> of a strong economy.</li></ul><p>Nevertheless, these advantages have come at a cost. <strong>The US has had to protect the petrodollar system from any country or person that challenged it. This has led to political meddling, war, and deaths over the years.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, it&rsquo;s alleged that the war against al-Qadhafi and Saddam Hussein may have been prompted by more than humanitarian efforts, hinting that the US was also protecting the petrodollar system.</p><p>Despite these efforts, the end of the dollar&rsquo;s dominance may have already begun. The continued deficit running by the United States means that countries may decide to downgrade the dollar&rsquo;s value. As a result, the purchasing power of the currency will sink. This is something that has been happening for years. It is for this reason that Saddam Hussein dumped the dollar for the Euro in the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the rising concern for global warming has made nations turn to more sustainable sources of energy. This could significantly minimize oil demand and, in consequence, petrodollars. Also, the number of dollars held in reserves is slowly declining based on <a href="https://data.imf.org/?sk=E6A5F467-C14B-4AA8-9F6D-5A09EC4E62A4"><u>data</u></a> from the IMF.</p><p>The United States has also been having strained relations with top economic powers like Russia and China. For example, Russia&rsquo;s Ukraine invasion saw the US <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/seizures-foreign-exchange-reserves-will-not-weaken-dollars-role-dominant-reserve"><u>seize</u></a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/freezing-russian-reserve-assets-marks-end-of-monetary-regime-gold-bitcoin-rise-arthur-hayes.htm">Russia&rsquo;s USD reserves</a>, kicking the country out of the dollar system.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the United States has sent similar <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3173273/us-sanctions-threat-if-china-aids-russia-stirs-fear-beijing"><u>threats</u></a> to China over the years, preventing it from doing things the former didn&#8217;t want it to do (like invading Taiwan, for example). Living under such threats isn&rsquo;t easy for these two countries that also want to dominate the world. Therefore, this is why there are hasting their plans to shift to another currency when trading oil.</p><h2>How Could Bitcoin Fix the Petrodollar System?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The emergence of cryptocurrencies has some experts predicting that Bitcoin could replace the petrodollar system. Russia has also <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/03/25/russia-bitcoin-payment-oil/7165901001/#:~:text=Russia%20may%20accept%20bitcoin%20as,country's%20energy%20committee%20announced%20Thursday."><u>announced</u></a> its consideration of the digital currency in oil trading.&nbsp;</p><p>So, why <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>?</p><h3>Bitcoin is Decentralized</h3><p>As we have learned from the harsh realities of the petrodollar system for anyone opposing it, having a central authority at the center of the oil market is detrimental. The US has used the power of its currency to invade countries, issue threats, and execute those threats.&nbsp;</p><p>The dollar is still widely used across the globe. This means any country that tries to switch to a different currency will have many difficulties navigating. So, the world is highly dependent on the dollar, and the US knows this. As a result, it can bend the world to its will. This system wouldn&rsquo;t change if another currency took the place of the dollar. In any case, it could be worse if a global reserve currency was under the control of a less democratic nation than the US.&nbsp;</p><p>With bitcoin, however, there&rsquo;s no central authority. It is fully decentralized and does not rely on &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; authorities. That means <strong>no one can confiscate the BTC reserves of another country since it&rsquo;s not associated with any government.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Moreover, bitcoin isn&rsquo;t tied to any known person, which means no government can use them to control its code. It could also bring to an end the system of one fiat currency dominating global markets.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin is a Store of Value</h3><p>The economic uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 led to more demand for bitcoin as a store of value. Several South American countries were recording high trading volumes while exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken were hiring.&nbsp;</p><p>This showed that bitcoin could indeed play a store of value role during a crisis, which could push more nation-states to adopt the currency as cash reserves or for their oil trade.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin is Disinflationary</h3><p>Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins. This means its value is likely to increase with time as more people begin to appreciate its decentralized and store of value benefits. Therefore, BTC is different from the US dollar, whose value has been decreasing over the years as its purchasing power reduces because of an ever-greater supply coming onto the markets.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin Potentially Offers Above-Average Returns</h3><p>Despite the ongoing crypto bear market, which has seen the price of BTC fall to the $16,000 mark, bitcoin has the potential to offer above-average returns. To illustrate, if you had invested $1,000 worth of bitcoin since December 2012, your total investment would be worth $1,581,578.17. This is an annualized return of 108.89%.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, if used a global reserve currency, countries could potentially enjoy a higher return on their cash reserves than if they were to stick their money into US treasuries in the long term.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin has the potential to fix the petrodollar system. But before this can happen, the digital currency will have to become less volatile &mdash; this could potentially be solved when it achieves widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>It may also gain the support of the United States since the nation may prefer it over the ruble and yuan, should Russia and China&#8217;s currencies play an increasingly important role in the oil trade in the future. Essentially, BTC may appear as the &ldquo;lesser evil&rdquo; in the eyes of the US.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, only time can tell what will happen in the future. But the collapse of the petrodollar system seems destined to happen at some point in the future as there are an increasing number of forces opposing it, including Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Holding bitcoin can be simple, but finding the right hardware wallet to store your coins can be tricky. Web and mobile wallets are usually preferred but have a risk factor of your coins being stolen through cyber hacks or phishing scams. Therefore, hardware wallets are the most secure option when it comes to storing your bitcoin. </p>
<p>In this guide, we will explain how hardware wallets work and list some of the most popular bitcoin-only hardware wallets in the market.</p>
<h2>What Is a Hardware Wallet? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>A hardware wallet is an encrypted portable device that is used to store your cryptocurrency in cold storage. However, it is not your coins that are stored directly on the device but the private keys that give you access to the coins that remain on the blockchain. Through a hardware wallet, you can conveniently manage your private keys and take self-custody of your assets.</strong></p>
<p>Hardware wallets are effective in securing your crypto by giving you an extra layer of security against hacking, phishing sites, and malware. A hardware wallet, which often comes in the form of a USB device, enables you to access your crypto from anywhere. You can plug a hardware wallet into your computer and manage it through its proprietary software to interact with decentralized applications, as well as send and receive cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Moreover, hardware wallets can support multiple digital assets simultaneously. For your convenience, different crypto assets can be backed up by a single recovery phrase. The recovery phrase can be used to access your cryptocurrency if your device containing your private keys is destroyed or stolen. That is why it is important to keep a copy of your recovery phrase and store it safely. </p>
<h2>Why You Should (Probably) Use a Hardware Wallet</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The main advantage of using a hardware wallet as opposed to a software wallet is that your entire bitcoin holdings remain offline. Remember, most theft and scams involving crypto assets happen because the web and mobile wallets are directly or indirectly connected to the internet by default. </p>
<p>When using a hardware wallet, the likelihood of being hacked reduces significantly since it&#8217;s a separate device where cryptocurrency transactions are manually and physically signed on the device itself. Only the cryptographically signed transaction hits the internet. </p>
<p>Hardware wallets also often possess extra security features like Two-Factor Authentication, a lock PIN, biometric security, and more. Moreover, the wallet device typically has a display that allows you to enter your PIN as well as confirm your address when transacting. </p>
<h2>How to Use a Bitcoin Hardware Wallet</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Using a Bitcoin hardware wallet is not that complicated, although they l differ from one manufacturer to another. </p>
<ol>
<li>The obvious first step will be to set up your hardware wallet. To do that, you will have to buy a hardware wallet from the device manufacturer. You should do the shopping for the device directly on the manufacturer’s website. Only then can you make sure that you do not buy a manipulated version of a hardware wallet. You can also order a bitcoin hardware wallet on a trusted e-commerce platform like Amazon though this opens you to some degree of counterparty risk as the wallet could potentially be manipulated.</li>
<li>Once you obtain the physical device, you then proceed to install the custom software that will assist you in setting up your wallet. This you can do by connecting the USB device to your computer. Once the hardware wallet application is running on your PC, several prompts will be issued for you to follow. </li>
<li>Begin the setup process and follow the prompts to their conclusion. At some point, you need to set a PIN code or receive one. Ensure you securely write down your PIN code so you won’t forget. Equally, be sure to write down your recovery phrase and store it offline in a secure location or several locations. The backup of the recovery phrase will make sure, you will always be able to restore your assets. </li>
<li>The application will then go on to create the wallet address that you can use to send and receive bitcoin. To transfer your bitcoin to your hardware wallet, copy your wallet address from the app’s front end and paste it into the sending tap within your sending wallet. Initiate the transaction, whereupon you will see the transaction details appear on your hardware wallet. </li>
<li>You can then check the display on your device that is connected to the PC to confirm the transaction details are correct, and that you are sending your bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin">BTC</a>) to the correct recipient wallet. Only if everything is correct, push the button on the hardware wallet to finalize the transaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we are assuming you are using a USB-stick-like hardware wallet device that comes with a display. However, hardware wallets come in all shapes and sizes, so the setup process can vary quite substantially, and some hardware wallets don&#8217;t really require any setup at all. </p>

As a result, more and more Bitcoiners are choosing to mix their coins using so-called Bitcoin mixers or tumblers.&nbsp;</p><p>Read on to discover what bitcoin mixers are, why you should or shouldn&#8217;t use them, and a list of the most popular bitcoin mixing services in the market.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are Bitcoin Mixers?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin mixers are a service that allows you to anonymize your bitcoin transactions by &lsquo;mixing&rsquo; them with other users&#8217; bitcoin transactions. This makes it much harder for anyone to track where your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin.htm"><strong>bitcoin</strong></a> came from or where you sent them to, essentially enabling transactional privacy for Bitcoiners.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of bitcoin mixers: <strong>centralized mixers</strong> and <strong>decentralized mixers</strong>.</p><h3>Centralized Mixers vs. Decentralized Mixers</h3><p><strong>Centralized mixers</strong> (also called centralized bitcoin tumblers) are run by a single entity, while decentralized bitcoin mixers are run by a distributed network of users. Both types of mixers have their advantages and disadvantages. Centralized mixers are typically easier to use and have more features than decentralized mixers. However, they are also more vulnerable to attacks and censorship.</p><p><strong>Decentralized mixers</strong>, on the other hand, are more resistant to attacks and censorship, but they can be more difficult to use. However, both centralized and decentralized mixers can help you protect your privacy when using bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>The type of mixer that is best for you will depend on your needs and preferences.</p><h2>Advantages of Using a Bitcoin Mixer&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are several advantages to using a bitcoin mixer.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Increases your transactional privacy and anonymity.&nbsp;</li><li>Helps you keep your bitcoin safe from thieves or hackers.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Disadvantages of Using a Bitcoin Mixer&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are also some disadvantages to using a bitcoin mixer.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The mixer you use may be hacked or stolen, resulting in a complete loss of your coins.</li><li>The mixer may be shut down by authorities, and your bitcoin could be frozen or seized.</li><li>If you use a centralized mixer, you are placing trust in a single entity, which could be risky.</li></ul><p>Overall, using a bitcoin mixer can be a good way to increase your privacy and anonymity when using bitcoin. However, there are some risks involved.</p><h2>How Bitcoin Mixers Work</h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/96178/239607/tobias-tullius-4dky7d3lkkm-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/96178/239607/responsive-images/tobias-tullius-4dky7d3lkkm-unsplash___media_library_original_1920_1276.jpg 1920w, https://cimg.co/news/96178/239607/responsive-images/tobias-tullius-4dky7d3lkkm-unsplash___media_library_original_1200_798.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/96178/239607/responsive-images/tobias-tullius-4dky7d3lkkm-unsplash___media_library_original_900_598.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/96178/239607/responsive-images/tobias-tullius-4dky7d3lkkm-unsplash___media_library_original_720_479.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/96178/239607/responsive-images/tobias-tullius-4dky7d3lkkm-unsplash___media_library_original_600_399.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/96178/239607/responsive-images/tobias-tullius-4dky7d3lkkm-unsplash___media_library_original_300_199.jpg 300w" width="1920" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Bitcoin mixers work by taking your bitcoin and mixing them with other users&#8217; bitcoin in their pool. This makes it much more difficult for anyone to track where your bitcoin came from or where they went. The mixers then send you back an equivalent amount of bitcoin from their pool, minus a service fee.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are a few different ways that bitcoin mixers perform their primary function of increasing bitcoin user anonymity.&nbsp;</p><p>Some mixers allow you to specify how many hops you want your coins to take before they are sent back to you. The more hops, the more secure, but also the more expensive. Some mixers allow you to set a time delay before the bitcoin are sent back to you, which makes it even harder to trace where they came from. Other mixers have multiple pools that mix the bitcoin, making it even more difficult to track any one user&#8217;s bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, remember that mixing your coins does not make them completely anonymous. If someone knows which addresses belong to you, they can still trace your transactions.</p><p>The biggest downside of using a bitcoin tumbler is that, in most cases, you have to trust the tumbling service provider with your bitcoin. If the tumbler is not honest, they could simply keep your bitcoin and never send them back. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important only to use reputable tumblers.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, there are a handful of bitcoin tumblers that have been around for years and have built up a good reputation, some of which we highlight below.</p><h2>Popular Bitcoin Mixing Services</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the most popular bitcoin mixing services available today.&nbsp;</p><h3>Wasabi Wallet</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wasabiwallet.io/"><strong><u>Wasabi Wallet</u></strong></a> is a popular bitcoin wallet that includes a Chaumian CoinJoin mixer.&nbsp;</p><p>While the website&rsquo;s servers may technically be centralized, it&#8217;s cleverly designed so that the operator cannot deanonymize users or steal funds. Moreover, the service has a nice user interface to make it clear which coins have been mixed and which have not.</p><h3>Samourai</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool"><strong><u>Samourai</u></strong></a> offers another popular bitcoin mixing service. The wallet is known for its privacy-centric features, which make it the perfect choice for those looking to keep their bitcoin transactions private.</p><p>Samourai Wallet, like Wasabi Wallet, comes with a Chaumian CoinJoin mixing service, called Whirlpool. However, while the Wasabi Wallet is only available on desktop, Samourai is also available on mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, for users to make fully anonymous transactions from their wallets and protect themselves from any snooping (even by the Samourai team), they would need to connect their wallets to their full <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node-a-step-by-step-guide.htm"><strong>Bitcoin node</strong></a>.</p><h3>Mixer.money</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mixer.money/en/"><strong><u>Mixer.money</u></strong></a><strong> </strong>is a bitcoin blender that divides the funds received from each user into smaller parts and mixes them with those of other clients. This way, you receive untraceable coins into your new address as smaller payments.&nbsp;</p><p>The platform uses two blending algorithms to anonymize its users&#8217; transactions, and it deletes all data used in these transactions after 48 hours.</p><p>Mixer.money doesn&rsquo;t require registration, and the bitcoin mixing process takes up to six hours. The service supports transactions ranging in size from 0.003 BTC to 50 BTC&mdash;and charges 4&ndash;5% per transaction plus a small fee for each output address (0.0007BTC). It is also a TOR-friendly bitcoin mixer.</p><h3>JoinMarket</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver"><strong><u>JoinMarket</u></strong></a> is an open-source software project that allows users to pool their coins together and then trade them back and forth, mixing up their history in the process. This makes it much harder for someone to track where your coins came from or where they&#8217;re going.</p><p>JoinMarket is easy to use and doesn&#8217;t require any extra setup or configuration. Just download the software and run it on your computer. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you can start mixing your coins right away.</p><p>One of the great things about JoinMarket is that it doesn&#8217;t require you to trust anyone else. The software is open source, and all transactions are done directly between users. There&#8217;s no need to worry about a third party stealing your coins or taking your personal information.</p><h3>Blindmixer</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blindmixer.com/"><strong><u>Blindmixer</u></strong></a> uses a special method called &#8220;blind signatures&#8221; to make transactions anonymous. It works as both a wallet and a centralized mixing service.</p><p>The mixer uses its proprietary coin selection algorithms and supports lightning transactions. It also allows users to transfer money instantly and for free between each other.&nbsp;</p><p>BlindMixer&rsquo;s wallet has a standalone application for Windows and Linux. It uses SegWit natively, offers low transaction fees right out of the box, and supports Lightning Network transactions.</p><h2>Should You Use a Bitcoin Mixer?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>When it comes to protecting your privacy and security online, there are a few different options available to you. One of these options is using a bitcoin mixer.&nbsp;</p><p>While some people believe that you should never mix your bitcoin, others think that it is a necessary evil.&nbsp;</p><p>So, <strong>should you use a bitcoin mixer?</strong></p><p>The short answer is that it depends.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking to simply purchase items or services online with bitcoin, then there is probably no need to mix your coins. However, if you are looking to invest a huge amount in bitcoin or hold onto it for a long period, then you may want to consider using a mixer.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few reasons why you might want to mix your bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>First, if you are holding bitcoin for investment purposes, then you may not want people to know how much bitcoin you have. This could lead to people trying to hack you to steal your coins.</li><li>Second, if you are going to be making large transactions with bitcoin, then you may not want people to know where the coins are coming from. This could lead to people trying to track down the source of the coins and potentially stealing them.&nbsp;</li><li>Third, if you are worried about government actions against Bitcoiners, then mixing your coins can help keep your identity and transactions private.&nbsp;</li><li>Lastly, if you simply want to add an extra layer of security to your bitcoin transactions, then mixing your coins can help make it more difficult for someone to track down your wallet address.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The main risk associated with using a bitcoin mixer is that you are trusting the service to keep your coins safe and anonymous. While most mixers do their best to keep your coins safe, there is always the possibility that something could go wrong.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>There have been instances in the past where mixers have been hacked, and users&#8217; coins have been stolen. Another risk is that if the service goes out of business, you could lose access to your coins. A possible solution for these issues is to use a trusted decentralized bitcoin mixer.</p><p>Though bitcoin mixers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as making it harder for people to track your spending, or increasing your privacy when using bitcoin, there are a few things to keep in mind when using a bitcoin mixer.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>First, remember that not all mixers are created equal. Some have been known to steal user funds, so it&#8217;s important to choose a reputable mixer.&nbsp;</li><li>Second, mixing your coins will usually cost you a small fee.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, remember that mixing your coins does not make them completely anonymous. If someone knows which addresses belong to you, they can still trace your transactions.</li></ul><p><strong>Now that you know what bitcoin mixers are and have a number of them to choose from, you can confidently start to keep your bitcoin transactions private.&nbsp;</strong></p>

While these investment vehicles are not without risk, they enable investors to earn above-average yields, making them alluring to a range of different investors.&nbsp;</p><p>In this guide, we will explain how crypto savings accounts work and why you might want to consider setting one up.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is a Crypto Savings Account?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>A crypto savings account is a saving offering that allows you to deposit your crypto assets and earn interest. Similar to regular savings accounts, the interest is paid out periodically, and you can withdraw your assets depending on the platform rules and the type of crypto you deposit.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Most blockchain networks offer a staking return (technically, it is no yield because staking yields mainly derive from network issuance), thereby paying something similar to interest to native token holders. Several centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) capitalize on this by offering interest-bearing accounts. To generate returns, they use a variety of methods besides staking your crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternative strategies consist of depositing your crypto in CeFi lending pools or providing liquidity to trading pools that power <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm"><strong>DeFi protocols</strong></a> like decentralized exchanges (DEXs).&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto savings accounts use the returns from these activities to pay you regular interest on your crypto deposits.</p><h2>How Crypto Savings Accounts Work</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>A crypto savings account offers a superior user experience in contrast to complicated blockchain protocols. As such, they offer an easy way for you to onramp into the crypto ecosystem and earn interest through centralized platforms, unlike the convoluted onboarding process common in DeFi protocols or native staking strategies to have users directly interact with the blockchain itself.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While most DeFi protocols offer greater returns compared to crypto savings accounts, many users deem them to be cumbersome because interacting with them is a rather unfamiliar practice. Conversely, crypto saving accounts enable you to interface with DeFi protocols through an app or CeFi platform, which makes it look a lot easier.</p><p>The benefit of using crypto savings accounts over a DeFi protocol is the convenience offered by the former. The key advantage offered by companies behind crypto savings accounts is that they handle some of the risks of placing your funds within DeFi protocols or public blockchains for staking.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these companies have agreements in place to pay customers first should they become insolvent, while other companies insure customer deposits and work with reputable custodians.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as we have seen in 2022, <strong>there are also companies that will take user funds in the case of insolvency, which poses the main risk for crypto savings account holders</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>As we mentioned in the first section, crypto savings accounts will use the deposited funds to participate in the staking of tokens, provide liquidity to automated market maker protocols or engage in lending activities. The interest payable in exchange for locking your crypto savings is in crypto and is typically subject to a variable rate. While the interest earned is variable, you are usually assured a fixed minimum percentage rate as a return.&nbsp;</p><h2>Types of Crypto Savings Accounts: Where Does The Yield Come From?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are two main types of crypto savings accounts: <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>fixed-rate</strong> accounts.&nbsp;</p><h3>Flexible Cryptocurrency Savings Accounts</h3><p><strong>Flexible (or variable-rate) crypto savings accounts</strong> are flexible and allow you to deposit or withdraw your crypto assets at any moment in time. These accounts have no lock-up period. Interest is often calculated daily or weekly. However, the trade-off for these types of accounts is the fact that the interest rates are usually lower.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fixed Cryptocurrency Savings Accounts</h3><p><strong>Fixed crypto savings accounts</strong> lock your funds for some time. Locked savings usually have a vesting period ranging from 7 to 120 days. After the lock-up period is over, you can redeem your funds (the principal) and interest or proceed to reinvest for extra fixed-interest periods.&nbsp;</p><h2>Are Crypto Savings Accounts Worth the Risk?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>Some crypto savings accounts allow you to earn up to 8% APY or more on your savings. However, these types of accounts are not without their risks.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While the level of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/5-risks-to-know-before-using-centralized-crypto-lending-platforms.htm"><strong>risk associated with these accounts</strong></a> doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make them a bad product, you are advised to be aware of all the risks before you set up a savings account and start using it.&nbsp;</p><p>An obvious risk is that crypto savings accounts usually don&rsquo;t come with state-regulated deposit insurance. With traditional savings accounts, customers&#8217; deposits are protected, and should a financial provider become insolvent, regulators will step in to make sure a portion of the loss is covered on behalf of customers. For instance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protects US customers on up to $250,000 in the case of a bank collapse.&nbsp;</p><p>Such guardrails do not exist for crypto assets as of now. If the company doesn&rsquo;t provide you with the private keys for the wallet holding your savings, you run the risk of losing your funds in the event the respective company goes under.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Giving up control of your crypto assets to a third party is a major concern, as recent incidents across the crypto world have shown. </strong>Essentially you are relinquishing your private keys to another party. If that party managing your crypto savings account lends the money to other counterparties and then happens to default on payments, you stand to lose a portion or all of your digital assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Another concern is price volatility which may affect your crypto holdings in savings accounts. If you deposited digital currency like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in your crypto savings accounts, then the total principal, as well as the return payments, will fluctuate according to market conditions. On the other hand, if the balance and interest are paid in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-earn-interest-stablecoins-beginners-guide.htm"><strong>dollar-denominated stablecoin</strong></a>, then it is easy to keep tabs on the interest payments.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, traditional savings accounts allow you to withdraw your money at your discretion. Every now and then, some crypto-savings accounts limit your withdrawals, allowing you only to take money from your accounts at specified intervals. Moreover, some crypto savings accounts will charge you for withdrawals. And should a crypto savings account provider get in trouble, they may permanently stop withdrawals.</p><p><strong>So what does all this mean for you as an individual investor?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Despite the risks, crypto savings accounts offer you the potential to get returns on your crypto assets. This is especially true if you lock up your crypto or choose a native token of a crypto exchange or crypto savings account provider.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Nexo increases interest up to 4% APY for holders that want to get the returns in their NEXO token. Crypto exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com also offer you higher interest rates if you lock away tokens in your savings accounts and denominate the returns in their token.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the prospects, you should only really open a crypto savings account at a platform you are comfortable with, that has been around for a while, and has a solid reputation. You should also read through the terms and conditions to see if the provider might have insurance for your deposits. More importantly, only invest what you can afford to lose because crypto savings accounts are far from risk-free.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>
