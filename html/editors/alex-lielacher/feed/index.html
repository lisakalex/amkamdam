In the book, Boyapati also argues that Bitcoin has the potential to displace other forms of money.</p><p><i>The Bullish Case for Bitcoin</i> was initially published as a long-form article before it was published as a book. The author discusses the anatomy of Bitcoin and why it&rsquo;s better than gold or other fiat currencies that existed before its inception.</p><p>If you have read the long-form article, <i>The Bullish Case for Bitcoi</i>n book is an excellent follow-up read as Boyapati has expanded on the ideas he presented in the article. Additionally, the book takes a non-technical approach when it comes to introducing Bitcoin, making it a great read for beginners.</p><p><i>GoodReads.com reader&rsquo;s ranking: 4.5</i></p><h3>Check Your Financial Privilege</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.amazon.com/Check-Your-Financial-Privilege-Gladstein/dp/B09V2NM9VJ"><i>Check Your Financial Privilege</i></a> is a book authored by Alex Gladstein and arguably one of the most interesting Bitcoin books in the market.

He gives examples where Bitcoin adoption has helped individuals in certain countries or cushioned those who&rsquo;d saved in Bitcoin when their currency became devalued.</p><p>Gladstein also shares how Bitcoin offers freedom from inflation, outdated monetary systems, and political strife for people living outside of Wall Street. In fact, he believes that Bitcoin can even save lives.</p><p>This book is an excellent read for anyone trying to understand how citizens in the developing world can use Bitcoin as a tool against high inflation and authoritarianism.</p><p><i>GoodReads.com reader&rsquo;s ranking: 4.4</i></p><h3>Learn Bitcoin: Become Financially Sovryn</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Bitcoin-Become-Financially-Sovryn-ebook/dp/B09B4LKBK3"><i>Learn Bitcoin</i></a> by Anita Posch is another excellent Bitcoin book. The book helps readers learn how and why they should start investing in Bitcoin. Posch uses the book to discuss all the facets of Bitcoin, from economical, political, social, and technical implications, to how it unfolds in today&rsquo;s monetary landscape.</p><p>The author takes a historical look into how Bitcoin came to be as she debunks popular misunderstandings and myths around cryptocurrencies. Posch&rsquo;s end goal is to create awareness of what Bitcoin is and how it enables financial fairness and social change.</p><p>This book is perfect for anyone looking for a step-by-step guide to navigating this new financial space.

She further discusses the decentralized autonomous organization (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dao/">DAO</a>) attack that happened in 2016 by explaining how it was done, and she goes into the aftermath of the hack.&nbsp;</p><p>Shin also takes readers through major crypto events that have taken place and helped propel the crypto industry forward.</p><p>The book is a great read for anyone looking to understand what happens behind the scenes in crypto, how it&rsquo;s moving forward, and who the key players are in the space.

The book also lays out a plan that readers can use to win back their freedom.&nbsp;</p><p><i>GoodReads.com reader&rsquo;s ranking: 3.5</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy reading any of the above-listed books to learn more about Bitcoin and other crypto technologies.</p><p>____</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/5-bitcoin-books-for-kids-you-could-gift-christmas.htm">5 Bitcoin Books for Kids You Could Gift This Christmas</a><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/these-school-children-take-crypto-related-lessons.htm">These School Children to Take Crypto-related Lessons</a><br><br>&#8211; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/want-to-fix-financial-literacy-focus-on-billionaires-politic-11272.htm">Want To Fix Financial Literacy?

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Amun AG</b>, a Switzerland-based digital asset investment company, known for its exchange-traded products (ETPs), plans to list them on at least two new European regulated exchanges, and believes that the trading volume will come from retail investors.</p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5df/919e60598c.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5df/919e60598c.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5df/919e60598c.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5df/919e60598c.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5df/919e60598c.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5df/919e60598c.jpg 1218w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/jansucko</figcaption></figure><p>Today, the exchange-traded products issuer lists cryptoasset investment products on the <b>SIX Swiss Exchange</b>, <b>BX Swiss</b> and <b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stock-exchange-giant-launched-crypto-platform-as-bakkt-went-4709.htm">Boerse Stuttgart</a></b> that provide investors with exposure to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">ripple (XRP)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">binance coin (BNB)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ether (ETH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tezos/">tezos (XTZ)</a>, and baskets of digital assets. </p><p>Meanwhile, in December, the company <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/amun-ag-allowed-to-expand-its-crypto-etp-offering-in-the-eu-5268.htm">received approval</a> to expand its crypto product offering to the European Union.</p><p>Laurent Kssis, Managing Director and Global Head of ETP, told <i>Cryptonews.com</i> that Amun plans &ldquo;to list on at least two European regulated exchange venues where a valid EU Base Prospectus (BP) is required.&rdquo; As most exchanges currently do not accept crypto investment vehicles, the company will lobby actively, he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, looking at the <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/trading/market_activity_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market activity</a> of the most popular exchange-traded products on SIX on December 13, we can see that the Amun Tezos ETP, which tracks the XTZ token, was the third most popular ETP on the Swiss exchange with a volume of 3,100 and a turnover of 83,000 Swiss francs. The only two financial instruments that were more popular were gold-based products.</p><p>While a Friday two weeks before Christmas is not illustrative of a normal trading day, we can see that crypto was traded &#8211; in regulated format &#8211; even on not-so-busy day. In the case of the Tezos ETP, we can attribute the trading activity to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tezos-flips-stellar-enters-top-10-going-for-bitcoin-sv-5301.htm">recent price jump of its token</a>.</p><p>However, a total trading volume of CHF 83,000 CHF (USD 84,000) pales in comparison to how much XTZ was traded on cryptoasset exchanges. According to CoinMarketCap, over USD 120 million worth of XTZ was traded across exchanges on December 13. </p><p>Moreover, the average daily trading volume of the <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/security_info_de.html?id=CH0491507486USD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amun Tezos ETP</a> on SIX amounts to 252 contracts, at the time of writing. That means that less than USD 10,000 worth of the ETP is traded on the Swiss exchange. </p><p>The picture doesn&rsquo;t look very different for the <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/security_info_en.html?id=CH0454664001USD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amun Bitcoin ETP</a>, the world&rsquo;s first physically-backed bitcoin exchange-trade product. Amun&rsquo;s exchange-traded bitcoin product has an average trading volume of 1,328 per day since its launch. At Friday&rsquo;s closing price of USD 37.11 that would amount to around USD 50,000 worth of bitcoin ETPs being traded on the SIX exchange per day. In comparison, bitcoin&rsquo;s 24hr exchange-traded volume on December 13 amounted to over USD 17 billion. </p><p>The most popular Amun ETP by trading volume is the <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/security_info_de.html?id=CH0445689208USD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP</a>, which carries the ticker &ldquo;HODL.&rdquo; The basket index tracks the five largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which includes BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, and LTC. The average trading volume of the ETP since inception equates to 13,713, which volume dropping off significantly in the second half of 2019. 13,713 at Friday&rsquo;s closing price of USD 16.49, would equate to an average daily trading volume of around USD 225,000. </p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5df/916a24c5e2.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5df/916a24c5e2.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5df/916a24c5e2.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5df/916a24c5e2.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5df/916a24c5e2.png 900w"><figcaption>Source: six-group.com</figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, it seems that, for now, crypto investors prefer to invest in digital assets directly via dedicated crypto exchanges and only a small number of institutional investors are timidly dipping their toes into this new digital asset class.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Switzerland is by far the most competitive market for crypto. All intermediaries, brokers and banks can sell crypto to their retail clients directly. Our ETPs have been designed for institutional clients from the outset as they can&rsquo;t buy crypto directly. The adoption from them is still nascent but growing,&rdquo; Kssis explained.</p></blockquote><p>He stressed that with their EU BP validated they are no longer restricted to just institutional investors and the company is actively exploring all European countries to promote their products.</p><p>&#8220;So, new admission to listing and access to retail is a key goal/achievement for Amun. Bear in mind, the company is just a year old and has listed ten products to date! We can easily see an additional five new products and multi-currency dual listings. Volumes will come from retail. So, it&rsquo;s key we are positioned locally!&rdquo; Kssis said.</p><p>Exchange-traded products are regulated investment vehicles that are bought and sold on stock exchanges in the same way as stocks. In case of Amun&rsquo;s ETPs, the underlying assets are digital currencies and tokens. The idea behind these investment products is that they enable both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to crypto in a fully-regulated manner without having to deal with the issue of storing cryptoassets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On August 24, 2017, the much awaited SegWit upgrade to the Bitcoin network was activated and with it came the promise of lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. Now, six months after the activation, SegWit adoption is on the rise and the benefits of this network upgrade are finally being felt by active bitcoin users. </p><p>Currently, over a quarter of bitcoin transactions are SegWit transactions. This is more than twice as many as in October 2017 and the number is on the rise according to data compiled by SegWit.Party. This is translating into much lower <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-fees-are-going-down-but-why-1268.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transaction fees</a> and a substantial increase in transaction speeds than we witnessed in the second half of 2017. </p><p>The increase in adoption is thanks to the growing number of bitcoin service providers who are implemented the network upgrade. </p><p>Moreover, version 0.16.0 of Bitcoin Core, the standard software client of the bitcoin network, was released on February 26 to provide full support for SegWit in the wallet and user interfaces, which has helped to boost SegWit adoption. </p><p>As a result of the increasing SegWit adoption, the number of unconfirmed transactions has dropped dramatically for first time in four months. Furthermore, average bitcoin transaction fees dropped from a high of over USD 50 in December to a current price of around USD 3. </p><p>It has to be said though, that the number of confirmed transaction did not solely drop due to the increase in SegWit adoption but also because outstanding bitcoin buy orders were clogging the network at the end of 2017 when bitcoin was close to its USD 20,000 all-time high and because of bitcoin&rsquo;s price drop, fewer people are buying bitcoin now than in late 2017. </p><p>Nonetheless, in light of the slow transactions times and high fees we witnessed in November and December of last year, this is a welcome sight to the active bitcoin community who actually use bitcoin as a spending currency and to send money abroad. </p><p>Furthermore, the rise in SegWit adoption is giving a clear signal that the bitcoin community wants to see bitcoin succeed, not only as a digital-gold like investment asset but as the world&rsquo;s leading alternative currency. </p><p>***</p><p><b><u>Background</u></b></p><p><i></i></p><p>Segregated Witness, more commonly referred to as SegWit, is an upgrade to the Bitcoin network that has been activated in August 2017 to provide a solution to bitcoin&rsquo;s scalability challenges and to eliminate the issue of transaction malleability. </p><p>SegWit aids bitcoin&rsquo;s scalability by increasing the effective block size without increasing the block size limit. Instead, SegWit removes signature data in each block to increase the number of bitcoin transactions that can be put into each block. This leads to the Bitcoin blockchain being able to process more transactions per second that before. </p><p>Prior to February, dozens of bitcoin wallets and exchanges &#8211; including Electrum, Ledger, LocalBitcoins, and Wirex &#8211; have already implemented SegWit much to the appreciation of their customers. </p><p>Bitcoin wallet and exchange Luno&rsquo;s SegWit announced SegWit support on February 14 and popular digital currency exchange Bitfinex made its announcement on February 20. </p><p>On February 23, Coinbase announced that it is implementing SegWit on both its Coinbase wallet and its GDAX exchange. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On December 10, 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), one of the leading derivatives exchanges in the US officially launched the trading of bitcoin futures contracts. A week later, on December 17, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange followed suit and also launched bitcoin futures on its exchange after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved the new financial product.</p><p>The announcement of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-altcoins-tumble.htm">bitcoin futures</a> coming to two leading U.S. derivative exchanges sparked bitcoin&rsquo;s incredible year-end rally that saw the price of bitcoin hit its 2017 high of USD 20,000 in mid-December, driven by the potential new investor funds that can now flow into bitcoin as both institutional investors and private investors are now able to bet on the price of bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle.</p><p><strong>What are Bitcoin Futures Contracts?</strong></p><p>Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date.&nbsp;<br>Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.</p><p><strong>How Do You Trade Bitcoin Futures?</strong></p><p>To trade bitcoin futures on the CME or the CBOE as a private investor, you need an account with a brokerage that offers bitcoin futures trading. As for January of 2018, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Ally Financial offer this to their clients but more brokerages are expected to follow suit.</p><p>Once you are registered with a broker that allows you to trade bitcoin futures you can buy them online in the same fashion that you would buy futures on commodities like gold, silver or oil.</p><p>If you believe that the price of bitcoin will hit USD 20,000 by mid-February, you could purchase a CBOE Feb 17 XBT futures contract at USD 15,000. If by February 14, 2018, when the contract expires, the price is at USD 20,000, you will have made a profit of USD 5,000. This profit could be higher depending on the leverage that your broker can provide you with. Of course, you can also close out your trade ahead of the expiry date if you want to take profit earlier.</p><p>However, if during the time of the contract the value drops, your broker will ask you to top up your margin account to ensure you can cover potential losses from the trade. If you fail to top up your maintenance margin account when you receive a margin call, your trade will be closed out for you by your broker.</p><p>Due to the added leverage that futures bring, they are considered a much riskier investment than stocks and bonds.</p><p>However, futures can also be used to hedge investment risk by entering into a short position. This was actually the original idea of commodity futures when they were introduced for farmers to hedge their market risk. For example, if a farmer knows he will raise 10,000 bushels of corn, he can short sell one futures contract for corn (assuming one contract covers 10,000 bushels of corn) at a specific price with the expiry set to the time when he plans on selling his corn. If the price of corn should drop before the farmer can sell his corn, this loss is offset by the gains on the short futures contract. In effect, commodity futures allow producers to lock in the price at which they want to sell their product.</p><p><strong>CME vs CBOE Bitcoin Futures</strong></p><p>Futures are standardized exchange-traded financial products. However, futures contract do differ from exchange to exchange. That means you can only trade CME bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and CBOE bitcoin futures only on the CBOE.</p><p>While the two bitcoin futures contracts trade in the same way from a technical point of view, they have the following key differences:</p><p>CME bitcoin futures have the ticker &lsquo;BTC&rsquo;, have a contract unit of five bitcoins and 35% initial margin is needed to place a trade. CBOE bitcoin futures, on the other hand, have the ticker &lsquo;XBT&rsquo;, their contract unit is one bitcoin, and the margin requirement is 44%.</p><p>Both futures contracts are in US dollar and are cash settled, which means no bitcoin are exchanged at the end of the contract &#8211; only the cash difference. Also, both contracts have the three closest months listed as contract expiry dates.</p><p>If you are entirely new to futures trading, you can start out practicing using the CME&rsquo;s bitcoin futures trading simulator before you place your first trade with your broker.</p><p><strong>Bitcoin Futures &#8211; The Early Days</strong></p><p>When bitcoin futures started to trade on the CBOE on December 10, 2017, the price rallied as investors were confident that the opening up of bitcoin to institutional investors in this format would bring new money into the asset class. On the exchange itself, however, trading volumes of bitcoin futures remained comparatively low and was reportedly largely dominated by retail investors[/URL] as institutional market participants were concerned about the clearing of these new futures.</p><p>Less than USD 10 million worth of bitcoin futures were traded on the CBOE in the first hour of trading while at the same time, the popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex traded around USD 170 million worth of bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin futures trading volumes have remained comparatively low at both the CME and the CBOE. At both exchanges, the January expiry contract is the most popular and is experiencing the most trading volume while February and March contracts are seeing very little trading action.</p><p>Judging by the current rate, it looks like it will take a few more months before bitcoin futures will take up a larger share of trading at the CME and CBOE. This is most likely the case as the majority of large investment houses are still assessing the risks of gaining exposure to a decentralized digital currency such as bitcoin.</p>
