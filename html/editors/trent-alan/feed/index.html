<p>Among considerations around attractive buys and the <strong>best crypto to buy now</strong>, <strong>ORDI</strong> has generated interest reaching a new all-time-high in a climate of optimism enabling a 27% surge so far today</p>
<p><strong>PEPE</strong> has also capitalized on recovery trends, surging nearly 30% from its established support level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong> is riding a 7% upswing, possibly fueled by MicroStrategy&#8217;s recent Bitcoin purchase.</p>
<p>In line with the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s positive momentum and restored confidence, ongoing crypto presales such as <strong>Bitcoin ETF Token</strong> and <strong>TG.Casino</strong> are similarly attracting speculative investments from investors seeking fresh Bitcoin alternatives.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Amid a robust market rebound, ORDI has registered a new all-time high of $49.660, echoing Bitcoin&#8217;s retest of the $42,000 level.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: $42,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/AvXeth6SNR">pic.twitter.com/AvXeth6SNR</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1731764593565790324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This surge reflects a broader market rally, with ORDI&#8217;s price experiencing a notable 27% increase so far today, and an impressive weekly gain of over 138%.</p>
<p>Year over year, ORDI&#8217;s market value has surged by more than 380%. Such strides in performance have shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin&#8217;s market dynamics, hinting at the possibility that ORDI could follow <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-breaches-40000-level-for-the-first-time-in-18-months.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s lead in the market&#8217;s bullish phase</a>.</p>
<p>Market analysts maintain a favorable forecast for ORDI, underpinned by heightened activity on the Ordinals protocol, a foundational technology for ORDI.</p>
<p>This protocol is a pivotal part of the Bitcoin network, hosting diverse content, and as transaction fees on Bitcoin have risen, ORDI&#8217;s prominence within the network has surged, <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">evidenced by over $46 million in total inscriptions as of writing</a>.</p>
<p>PEPE, another contender for the best crypto to buy now, has been navigating through price fluctuations with a recent rally of over 25% from its support level.</p>
<p>The momentum indicates a potential further surge of 30% to retest its overhead resistance ranging between $0.000001713 and $0.000001770.</p>
<p>Currently trading around $0.000001357, PEPE is up by 12.52% so far today.</p>
<p>The meme coin&#8217;s steady performance above the 100-day exponential moving average suggests the token has stable upward momentum.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash is also witnessing a positive price movement, with a 7% increase so far today placing it at a trading price of $247.9.</p>
<p>The uptrend in Bitcoin Cash is part of the overall uptick in the cryptocurrency market, spurred by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategys-michael-saylor-is-now-in-almost-2-billion-profit-from-bitcoin-holdings-will-he-sell.htm">MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin acquisition</a> and the consequent rise in market optimism.</p>
<p>Amidst this dynamic market, the crypto presale space is also attracting attention, with offerings such as Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino presenting new investment opportunities.</p>
<p>As fresh cryptos launch in presale, investors closely track these early-stage opportunities that may become the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">next big cryptocurrencies to buy</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>ORDI Price Soars to New Heights in Price Discovery Mode</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_139171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139171" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139171" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart.png" alt="ORDI price tradingview chart" width="1814" height="850" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart.png 1814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-1024x480.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-768x360.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-1536x720.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-150x70.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139171" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ORDIUSDT/">ORDIUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ORDI price has been on a tear recently, with a rise of nearly 150% from its support around the Fib 0.382 level of $18.449.</p>
<p>A surge of 27.43% in the current trading day alone has pushed the price to a record $48.131, as ORDI successfully ventured into price discovery mode.</p>
<p>This momentum suggests that the path to least resistance is currently on the upside.</p>
<p>Looking at key technical indicators, we see a compelling story unfolding for ORDI&#8217;s immediate future.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the ORDI price is at $24.967, significantly above both the 50-day EMA of $17.742 and the 100-day EMA of $12.801.</p>
<p>This widening gap between the short-term and long-term EMAs indicates a strong bullish momentum in the ORDI price.</p>
<p>The RSI for ORDI, which stands at 84.79, up from yesterday&#8217;s 79.34, is well into the overbought territory.</p>
<p>Typically, an RSI above 70 suggests that the asset may be overbought and due for a correction.</p>
<p>However, during strong trends, assets can remain overbought for extended periods.</p>
<p>The sharp rise in the RSI underscores the robust buying sentiment that has propelled the ORDI price to its current highs.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram further accentuates the bullish picture, with a reading of 1.928, a considerable increase from yesterday&#8217;s 0.822.</p>
<p>This growing positive value is indicative of the bullish sentiment gaining further momentum, which could boost the ORDI price even more.</p>
<p>The immediate resistance for the ORDI price lies at the psychological level of $50, followed by the Extended Fib -1 level of $52.910.</p>
<p>The ability of ORDI to break through these resistance levels could signal a continuation of its upward trend.</p>
<p>However, traders should also keep an eye on potential support levels.</p>
<p>The first immediate support can be found at the Extended Fib -0.786 level of $47.573.</p>
<p>If the ORDI price were to experience a pullback, this could serve as a critical line of defense.</p>
<p>Further down, the Extended Fib -0.618 level of $43.384 could also provide support.</p>
<p>As the ORDI price heads into uncharted territory, traders and investors are advised to monitor these technical indicators closely.</p>
<p>While the current bullish indicators suggest an upward momentum, the high RSI could also point to a potential pullback soon.</p>
<p>Therefore, a balanced approach that considers both the bullish signals and the potential for correction could be the key to navigating the next phase of ORDI&#8217;s journey.</p>

<p>The PEPE price is showing a promising trend after a bounce from its immediate support level, which is around the 50-day EMA and the Fib 0.5 level of $0.000001029.</p>
<p>As PEPE sets a new multi-month high at $0.000001497, traders are witnessing selling pressure near the immediate resistance level despite a considerable upswing of 12.52% so far today.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for PEPE is currently at $0.000001149, indicating a bullish sign as it is significantly above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs (at $0.000001082 and $0.000001052, respectively).</p>
<p>Given these conditions, it&#8217;s plausible that PEPE will continue its upward trajectory, with the 20-day EMA acting as a strong support level for the increasing price.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp">RSI (Relative Strength Index)</a> has seen a considerable jump, moving from yesterday&#8217;s 57.29 to today&#8217;s 65.78, suggesting that buying momentum is increasing.</p>
<p>If the RSI continues to climb and crosses the overbought level of 70, it could indicate a potential price correction in the near term.</p>
<p>However, it is currently in a healthy range, suggesting that PEPE still has room to appreciate before hitting overbought territory.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram has turned positive from yesterday&#8217;s neutral reading, marking a bullish MACD crossover.</p>
<p>This is typically seen as a bullish sign and might indicate that the PEPE price could continue its upward trajectory in the short term.</p>
<p>The PEPE price currently faces a horizontal resistance zone between $0.000001406 and $0.000001465.</p>
<p>If PEPE can break through this resistance, it could signal a continuation of the current uptrend.</p>
<p>On the contrary, should selling pressure increase, we might see a pullback to the immediate support level.</p>
<p>The immediate support for the PEPE price lies at the 20-day EMA of $0.000001149, which is closely followed by the Fib 0.618 level of $0.000001132.</p>
<p>If these support levels are breached, it might suggest a short-term bearish trend.</p>
<p>The PEPE price looks to be in a strong position right now, with the MACD suggesting potential upward momentum and the RSI indicating increased buying pressure. However, as always in trading, traders are advised to be aware of the potential for sudden reversals.</p>

<p>The BCH price has seen a dramatic turnaround in sentiment over the past few days.</p>
<p>After weeks of lackluster trading and declining volumes, BCH surged over 7% on Monday to break above the $240 level for the first time in over two weeks.</p>
<p>This sharp move appears driven by improving technical indicators and a breakout from a long-term downtrend line.</p>
<p>As the BCH price seeks to continue this bullish momentum, key levels are coming into focus.</p>
<p>On the indicator front, the BCH price rally comes alongside a notable improvement in both oscillators and moving averages.</p>
<p>The RSI has surged from oversold territory below 30 yesterday to 67.17 today.</p>
<p>This rapid climb out of oversold suggests gathering bullish momentum that could propel the BCH price higher.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory above 0 for the first time in weeks, printing at 2.0 against yesterday&#8217;s 0.6.</p>
<p>This bullish crossover in the MACD highlights accelerating positive momentum.</p>
<p>The BCH price is also seeing its shorter-duration EMAs cross above longer-duration averages.</p>
<p>With the 20-day EMA at $229.7 now trending above the 50-day EMA at $230.3, bullish sentiment appears to be returning to the BCH market.</p>
<p>In terms of key levels, BCH managed to close decisively above the resistance zone between $230 to $237.8.</p>
<p>This area had capped upside progress for over a month. Now turned support, it will be important for the BCH price to hold above this level on any pullbacks.</p>
<p>On the upside, the BCH price is fast approaching the next resistance zone between $270.6 to $278.</p>
<p>This area lines up with the Fib 0.236 level at $272.8, making it a level bulls must conquer to maintain control.</p>
<p>Overall, while technicals have turned decisively bullish, follow-through will be key.</p>
<p>The BCH price needs to hold the breakout over $230 and challenge the upper resistance at $270 to confirm the developing uptrend.</p>
<p>If bearish momentum returns and the BCH price falls back below $230, the rally may be short-lived.</p>
<p>In addition to trading based on technical analysis, research-driven investors look for presales that offer ground-floor entry to the next big cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino are two such overlooked options.</p>
<h2><strong>Overlooked Bitcoin Alternatives With Potential in 2023 and Beyond</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Bitcoin remains the dominant force in crypto, investors are exploring up-and-coming Bitcoin alternatives that lack widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Getting in early on carefully selected new crypto projects provides exposure at a fraction of future valuations.</p>
<p>Two such overlooked presales offering potential upside are Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>These fresh blockchain-based concepts are seeking to disrupt established finance and gambling sectors respectively.</p>
<p>Investing in these under-the-radar presales early presents upside potential before wider recognition kicks in.</p>
<p><iframe title="&#x1f525; Top 3 Cryptocurrency Presales: Your Ticket to 10X Gains! Don&#039;t Miss Out! &#x1f4b0;&#x1f680;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ffzrEB-Jqc?start=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Rather than sticking with predictable crypto giants, these presales offer ground-floor entry to pioneering Bitcoin alternatives and disruptive new crypto projects.</p>
<p>Pinpointing and investing in platforms on the cusp of addressing unmet needs before mass awareness can yield substantial returns.</p>
<p>The key is identifying the next big breakthroughs in crypto before the crowd catches on.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Breaks $40K, Highlighting the Potential of the Bitcoin ETF Token Presale as a Best Crypto to Buy Now</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">pending SEC approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> has sparked interest in a new token seeking to provide exposure to the event.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) has raised over $2.47 million so far in its presale, showing why some investors see it as one of the best crypto to buy now in anticipation of the SEC&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>The presale utilizes unique tokenomics to tie the token&#8217;s price to milestones in the SEC approval process.</p>

<p>Specifically, the total supply of 100 billion BTCETF tokens will be decreased by 5% every time a predetermined SEC approval milestone is reached.</p>
<p>These milestones are enshrined in smart contracts to trigger automatic supply burns.</p>
<p>In addition, a 5% tax on all BTCETF transactions is implemented during the presale, which will decrease by 1% for each milestone achieved.</p>
<p>This tax is intended to discourage flipping and incentivize longer-term holds.</p>
<p>The presale price for each BTCETF token currently stands at $0.0062. However, as predetermined SEC approval milestones are met, the automatic token burns enacted will rapidly decrease the circulating supply.</p>
<p>With lessening token availability, BTCETF could foreseeably trade at a premium.</p>
<p>The presale mirrors the countdown to the SEC’s ETF decision, which some analysts predict could arrive as soon as January 10, 2024.</p>
<p>For cryptocurrency investors, BTCETF provides an opportunity to anticipate how the market may respond to a major event that is expected to increase mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The token has attracted investors seeking targeted exposure along with the presale incentives.</p>

<p>AI cryptocurrencies continue to attract interest from investors of all stripes seeking opportunities in the digital asset market. Seasoned investors, referred to as “smart money”, tend to act cautiously when evaluating new crypto offerings, however.</p>
<p>The recent presale success of Launchpad XYZ and its AI crypto trading tools provides an intriguing case that is catching the eye of smart money players in the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/en"><strong><u>Visit Launchpad XYZ Now</u></strong></a></p>
<h2>Crypto Presale Soars Past $2.1 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Launchpad XYZ commenced a presale of its native LPX token in early 2023. The presale has met with substantial interest, raising over $2.1 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">The crypto presale</a> utilizes a bonus structure that rewards early participants. At present, presale buyers receive a 6% bonus in additional LPX tokens, a figure set to reduce by 1% weekly. The presale bonus provides an incentive for investors to act quickly and gain maximum advantage.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The platform also utilizes an NFT pass system with varying tiers based on the investment amount. Each tier unlocks incremental benefits on the Launchpad XYZ platform, from basic educational resources to VIP communities. Higher tiers offer holders more utility in using Launchpad XYZ’s trading tools.</p>
<p>Behind much of the presale excitement are Launchpad XYZ’s proprietary AI analytics engines, Apollo and LPQ. These tools will provide users with data-driven insights and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-driven-trading-strategies-analyzing-the-success-and-limitations-of-automated-trading-software.htm">personalized trading strategies</a>.</p>
<p>During the presale period, the platform’s alpha trading signal Telegram group has yielded exceptional returns for its community. Numerous trades have produced triple-digit returns, signaling the potential capabilities of Launchpad XYZ’s trading algorithms.</p>
<p>The LPQ tool is powered by AI and over 400 data points to generate trading signals and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-breaches-40000-level-for-the-first-time-in-18-months.htm">predict price movements</a>.</p>
<p>For novice traders, Launchpad XYZ seeks to make AI-powered trading more accessible. For smart money investors, these AI functionalities appear to be a core reason driving the presale’s success.</p>
<h2>Smart Money Tracking Launchpad XYZ Closely</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Venture capital firms, hedge funds, and crypto-focused investment funds are examples of smart money participants actively evaluating new blockchain projects. These experienced investors tend to act based on project fundamentals and long-term return potential.</p>
<p>In Launchpad XYZ’s case, its AI trading focus provides a dual incentive. The platform’s presale represents an investment opportunity offering sizable bonuses for early buyers. Additionally, its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/trading-tools/">trading tools</a> could prove valuable for funds employing algorithmic or quantitative strategies.</p>
<p>The ability to use Launchpad XYZ’s AI systems for trading could be a factor in persuading smart money to buy the LPX token during presale. If the tools deliver consistent returns, demand for the token enabling the platform access could increase greatly.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Beyond its AI analytics engines, Launchpad XYZ has outlined several upcoming expansions. A <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">decentralized exchange</a> and a gaming hub are slated to launch before the end of 2023. The platform also plans to become a portal bridging Web2 and Web3 functionalities.</p>
<p>While the presale is the current focus, Launchpad XYZ’s technology roadmap provides grounds for long-term optimism. As both a crypto investment and trading gateway, the platform checks several boxes that appeal to crypto investors.</p>
<p>Its presale traction already confirms interest in what Launchpad XYZ is building. As the project continues boosting its capabilities, smart money backers could provide key validation signaling a promising future. For now, the platform’s AI crypto tools appear positioned to continue attracting attention.</p>

<p>Today, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced plans to host a forum focused on blockchain technology and digital assets, bringing together candidates for the 2024 US presidential election. The event will take place in New Hampshire on December 11 as part of Coinbase&#8217;s &#8220;Stand With Crypto&#8221; campaign.</p>
<p>The Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopresidentialforum.splashthat.com/">Crypto Presidential Forum</a> will give presidential candidates an early opportunity to share their perspectives on blockchain with voters in New Hampshire, which will hold an influential primary in January 2024. According to the event website, Republican candidates Asa Hutchinson and Vivek Ramaswamy have confirmed their participation, along with Democratic candidate Dean Phillips.</p>
<p>Additional candidates like Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were invited but have not yet responded. The forum is open-ended and not limited to crypto-specific issues, enabling candidates to voice their policies on a range of topics before the primary.</p>
<h2>Crypto Taking Center Stage</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The upcoming forum shines a spotlight on the growing prominence of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-us-house-speaker-mike-johnson-sparks-hope-for-advancing-digital-asset-legislation.htm">digital assets in US politics</a>. Cryptocurrency has become a hot topic on campaign trails, with candidates like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gop-candidate-ramaswamy-would-reduce-govt-involvement-in-crypto-if-elected.htm">Vivek Ramaswamy making it central</a> to their platform.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are excited to announce the first-ever Crypto Presidential Forum!</p>
<p>Join us in New Hampshire to hear directly from candidates about their positions on crypto policy and a wide range of other topics. Audience members will be able to submit questions. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While President Biden has remained relatively quiet on crypto, the upcoming election brings fresh chances for blockchain policy to take center stage. Surveys show <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/10/26/84-of-us-voters-say-that-politicians-crypto-positions-will-impact-vote/">crypto has bipartisan support among US voters</a>. Yet concrete policies have lagged behind public opinion and adoption.</p>
<p>The Coinbase-hosted forum will enable candidates to formally share their positions with crypto-savvy voters in New Hampshire. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/19/politics/new-hampshire-primary-all-over-the-map/index.html">New Hampshire&#8217;s early primary gives it special power</a> to influence campaigns. Strong showings in these states can shape perceptions as candidates move into later nominating contests.</p>
<p>&#8220;This special opportunity allows you to hear from each presidential candidate and will provide candidates with a venue to address the crypto and blockchain community in New Hampshire,&#8221; it noted on the Stand With Crypto website. &#8220;The topics will not be limited to crypto-specific issues. Instead, this forum is designed to enable candidates to address the crypto and blockchain community on a range of policies in advance of the New Hampshire Primary.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Crypto Voters Up For Grabs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Currently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-matchup/index.html">polls predict a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024</a>. Coinbase&#8217;s blockchain forum provides an opportunity for other candidates to sway voters who care about blockchain regulation, however. With digital asset ownership rising across party lines, many crypto-focused constituents are still undecided.</p>
<p>By bringing presidential hopefuls together to discuss this key issue, the Crypto Presidential Forum will give voters more insights to inform their choices. The open exchange of ideas may also encourage candidates to take a stand on topics that could soon impact millions of Americans.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> continue to enter the mainstream, voters are pressing candidates for clear stances on regulation. The New Hampshire forum marks an early milestone in shaping the role of blockchain policy during the 2024 race. With the primaries fast approaching, presidential contenders will soon need to cement their positions on this increasingly relevant topic.</p>

<p>The <strong>UK Treasury Committee</strong> released a report on December 2, advising the <strong>Bank of England</strong> to proceed cautiously with plans for a <strong>retail digital pound</strong>, citing concerns that its introduction <strong>could spark bank runs</strong> and destabilize the financial system.</p>
<p><a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42395/documents/210641/default/">In their report</a>, the cross-party group of MPs urged the central bank to impose <strong>strict limits on individual holdings</strong> of a digital currency, arguing lower thresholds could reduce risks of large-scale outflows from commercial bank deposits.</p>
<p>The committee warned that <strong>easy conversion</strong> of deposits into digital pounds could see consumers quickly withdraw funds at times of economic stress, increasing the <strong>likelihood of bank failures</strong>.</p>
<h2>Mitigating the Threat of Bank Runs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Treasury Committee said while the introduction of a <strong>central bank digital currency</strong> (CBDC), or digital pound, could provide <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/063/2023/011/article-A001-en.xml#:~:text=CBDC%20has%20special%20aspects%20that,lower%20costs%20and%20greater%20accessibility.">useful benefits to the economy</a>, these would need to clearly outweigh any <strong>risks posed to financial stability</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Why do we need a limit for how many digital pounds I can hold?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VQ5VMiPLkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Members called for <strong>additional safeguards</strong> to mitigate threats of destabilizing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bloomberg-analyst-crypto-faced-its-own-set-of-bank-runs-alongside-wider-economy.htm">bank runs</a>, including setting <strong>maximum individual holdings</strong> below the proposed £10,000 to £20,000 limits.</p>
<p>The thresholds could then be <strong>gradually increased over time</strong> as authorities monitor the impact on commercial bank funding and lending rates.</p>
<h2>Privacy and Data Protection Concerns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Treasury Committee report also stressed the need for robust <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/people-want-data-privacy-but-don-t-always-know-what-they-re-8165.htm">privacy protections</a> within any digital pound framework.</p>
<p>It stated that primary legislation for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-residents-flags-privacy-concerns-in-digital-pound-consultations-bank-of-england.htm">UK CBDC</a> should <strong>prohibit the government</strong> or the central bank from <strong>accessing data</strong> for any purpose beyond law enforcement needs.</p>
<p>While the Bank of England has said it <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2023/2023/enabling-innovation-through-a-digital-pound">does not intend to use transaction data</a> for policy or regulatory purposes, the MPs said <strong>clear legal parameters</strong> are still required.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury Committee further advised the Bank of England to maintain an open mind on whether a retail digital pound is necessary.</p>
<p>It concluded that policymakers must gather <strong>solid evidence</strong> of clear <strong>economic benefits</strong> before deciding to introduce a digital version of the currency.</p>
<p>According to the report, the project should only move forward if authorities are confident that associated risks can be effectively managed.</p>
<p>For now, the Bank of England is <strong>still in the design phase</strong> as it continues analyzing the complex considerations around a potential CBDC.</p>
<p>Any final decisions are unlikely <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67590468">before the latter half of the decade</a>, pointing to a slow and cautious approach to developing a retail digital pound.</p>

<p>Today, cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com gained key regulatory approval in the United Kingdom. The company announced in a press release that it has been authorized as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) by the UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>
<h2>The Approval Provides Access to the UK E-Money Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The EMI approval will allow Crypto.com to offer a range of UK-localized <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/electronic_money/html/index.en.html">e-money products and services</a>, aligning with the company&#8217;s focus on meeting the UK&#8217;s high levels of consumer protection through compliance with FCA&#8217;s regulatory regime.</p>
<p>As an authorized EMI, Crypto.com can now tap into the rapidly growing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-england-and-uks-fca-propose-plans-to-regulate-stablecoins.htm">UK electronic money market</a>. The approval enables the platform to provide e-money services like issuance, redemption, and payment services in the country.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are proud to announce that <a href="https://t.co/bbHWVWCATn">https://t.co/bbHWVWCATn</a> has been authorised as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), building on our position in the UK market and following our registration as a crypto asset business in August 2022 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png" alt="🇬🇧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />! <a href="https://t.co/rX4MWotaXs">pic.twitter.com/rX4MWotaXs</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;The UK has and continues to be a hugely important market for our business and the greater industry,&#8221; <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-receives-authorisation-as-an-electronic-money-institution-from-the-united-kingdoms-financial-conduct-authority">said Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek in the press release</a>. &#8220;We look forward to continuing to collaborate with a global regulatory leader in the FCA in our collective pursuit of responsible innovation for crypto.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Crypto.com&#8217;s FCA Registration</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The EMI authorization follows Crypto.com&#8217;s <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/firm?id=0014G00002antHVQAY">registration as a cryptoasset business with the FCA in August 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The e-money approval represents an additional layer of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-crypto-compliance-by-enforcement-push-continues-as-bittrex-hit-with-24-million-fine.htm">regulatory compliance</a> in the UK on top of its existing crypto registration. With two regulatory licenses in the country, Crypto.com can now offer both crypto and fiat-based financial services to UK consumers.</p>
<p>The UK approval is the latest addition to Crypto.com&#8217;s growing list of global regulatory licenses and registrations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the platform received its <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-obtains-major-payment-institution-licence-from-monetary-authority-of-singapore">Major Payment Institution license</a> from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. It has also gained key approvals in markets like the US, France, Australia, South Korea, and more.</p>
<p>The company seems intent on adhering to local regulations as it continues expanding worldwide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/electronic-money-payment-institutions">The EMI authorization</a> is an important milestone for the cryptocurrency industry as it seeks to gain mainstream adoption. Crypto platforms have been working to comply with financial regulations across different jurisdictions. Obtaining regulatory licenses helps provide legitimacy as well as consumer protection.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges have transformed over the years, evolving from basic exchange services to comprehensive financial ecosystems. This evolution reflects a growing demand for platforms that offer more than just transaction capabilities. Today&#8217;s traders seek environments that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and a range of financial tools. These platforms are increasingly integrating educational resources and community features to support informed trading decisions.</p>
<p>Following this trend of dynamic evolution within <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a>, a new crypto trading platform, Launchpad XYZ, is making its presence known. The platform is currently running a presale phase for its LPX token, which has attracted considerable interest, raising $2.1 million so far. The LPX token, priced at $0.0445, offers an intriguing prospect for early adopters.</p>

<h3>The Crypto Presale Incentive: A Closer Look at the LPX Token</h3>
<p>A notable feature of the LPX presale is the bonus structure in place. Presale participants are rewarded with an additional 20% in LPX tokens, a figure that decreases by 1% every seven days. At present, the bonus stands at 6%, providing a time-sensitive incentive for potential investors.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ has also introduced a five-tier <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-nft-marketplaces.htm">NFT</a> pass system for presale buyers, each tier offering escalating benefits. Ranging from the &#8216;Doge&#8217; pass at a $50 investment, providing basic access to resources, to the &#8216;Elon&#8217; tier for investments exceeding $25,000, which includes additional perks, this system caters to a diverse range of investors. Each tier offers varying degrees of access to Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s resources, such as trade insights and VIP Telegram groups.</p>
<p>Apollo is the first of Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s AI offerings and is designed to assist users in creating a personalized trading strategy. Complementing this is the Launchpad Quotient (LPQ), an AI-powered tool for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-becomes-5th-most-traded-crypto-in-the-world-adoption-rising.htm">price prediction</a> and investment decisions.</p>
<p>The platform is also working on a high-liquidity trading terminal and educational resources on cryptocurrency markets. Its proprietary Apollo and LPQ systems will utilize AI and over 400 data points to guide <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2023/11/29/impact-investing-strategies-to-accelerate-positive-change/">investment strategies</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>During the presale, Launchpad XYZ has opened an <a href="https://t.co/ZUZaIKgy84">alpha call crypto signals group on Telegram</a>. This group&#8217;s performance has been noteworthy, with 23 trades yielding returns of over 100%, eight trades with returns exceeding 1000%, and one remarkable trade yielding 7000% returns. These figures offer a glimpse into the potential effectiveness of the platform&#8217;s trading strategies.</p>
<h3>Expanding Horizons: Gaming, DEX, and Metaverse Initiatives</h3>
<p>Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s roadmap extends beyond its current offerings. Plans are underway to introduce a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-to-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn gaming hub</a>. Additionally, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is in the works, seeking to enhance user autonomy in crypto trading. The platform also envisages a token directory and a metaverse library, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive crypto resource.</p>
<p>The overarching mission of Launchpad XYZ is to bridge the gap between traditional internet platforms (Web2) and decentralized networks (Web3). This ambition reflects a commitment to broadening the accessibility of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, potentially driving mass adoption in the digital age.</p>
<p>In sum, Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s blend of current features and future aspirations paints a picture of a platform keen on innovation and user empowerment in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>As TIA&#8217;s price has ascended by nearly 11% so far today, <b>Celestia</b> stands out as one of the<b> best crypto to buy now</b>, with December welcoming robust broader cryptocurrency market volatility.</p>
<p><b>Immutable</b> and <b>Blur</b> are likewise making notable strides with <b>crypto presales</b> for <b>Bitcoin ETF Token</b> and <b>Meme Kombat</b> also attracting investor interest.</p>
<h2><b>Best Crypto to Buy Now in the News</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Celestia&#8217;s token, TIA, is currently trading at $7.0945 up nearly 11% so far today.</p>
<p>This followed a substantial rise in November when Celestia (CEL) gained over 230% between November 9 and November 18.</p>
<p>Having recently hit an all-time high of around $7.42 before decreasing to stagnate around the $5.50 price point, TIA&#8217;s overall trajectory remains upward.</p>
<p>With bullish projections driven by positive market movements and sentiment, TIA has the potential to retest its current high and could subsequently break that threshold to set a new all-time high before the year&#8217;s end if momentum continues.</p>
<p>Immutable is experiencing a 10% gain so far today as it currently trades at $1.4099.</p>
<p>Despite a slight decrease of nearly 4% over the past week, the broader price action indicates a potential bounce, suggesting a retest of its immediate resistance level, which is a potential rise of 13-17% from the current levels.</p>
<p>BLUR saw substantial gains in November, closing out the month with an increase of over 108%.</p>
<p>This performance highlights BLUR&#8217;s growing relevance and demand in the NFT space.</p>
<p>Despite some fluctuations throughout the month, the overall trajectory for BLUR remains bullish.</p>
<p>With major price supports in sight, BLUR is in a position to rally and continue gaining as its platform&#8217;s NFT marketplace sees more adoption.</p>
<p>Amidst these cryptocurrencies showing dynamic market movements, the industry is also observing crypto presales for their potential impact.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and Meme Kombat are among such presales drawing interest due to their prospective offerings.</p>
<p>With the market providing opportunities like Celestia, Immutable, and Blur, as well as crypto presales for Bitcoin ETF Token and Meme Kombat, it&#8217;s worth diving deeper into the technical and fundamental factors driving their momentum.</p>
<p>Read on to see the indicators and developments positioning them as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy now</a>.</p>
<h2>Celestia (TIA) Price Breaks Out of Range Resistance, Gaining Momentum</h2>

<p>After a robust breakout from its range resistance at the Fib 0.236 level of $6.1979 yesterday, Celestia (TIA) has been making notable upward strides so far today.</p>
<p>The TIA price is currently trading at $7.0945, marking an impressive 10.98% jump so far today.</p>
<p>The coin&#8217;s current trajectory seems to be heading at its immediate resistance zone, and if this momentum continues, it could signal a more extended bullish run.</p>
<p>The 10-day <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp">EMA (Exponential Moving Average)</a> for the TIA price stands at $6.1420, well above the 20-day EMA of $5.4212.</p>
<p>Such a position usually indicates a bullish sentiment since the short-term EMA is above the longer-term EMA.</p>
<p>It implies that recent price increases are outpacing the average, indicating positive momentum.</p>
<p>However, traders should exercise caution as the current TIA price is approaching its immediate resistance, which ranges from $7.1401 to $7.42.</p>
<p>If TIA can successfully breach this resistance zone, it could signal a continuation of the upward trend. Otherwise, a pullback could be on the cards.</p>
<p>TIA&#8217;s RSI currently stands at 67.08. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100, and an RSI above 70 typically indicates that a cryptocurrency is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the RSI for the TIA price shows bullish momentum, traders should be aware of the possibility of a reversal as the RSI inches closer to the overbought region.</p>
<p>On the downside, TIA has a robust support system. The immediate support is at the Fib 0.236 level of $6.1979, followed closely by the 10-day EMA of $6.1420.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an even stronger horizontal support zone that ranges from $5.1260 to $5.4565, which is in confluence with the 20-day EMA of $5.4212 and the Fib 0.382 level of $5.4456.</p>
<p>This layered support system provides a safety net for the TIA price should it encounter a pullback, potentially cushioning any significant declines.</p>
<p>The current TIA price movement indicates robust upward momentum.</p>
<p>However, as it approaches the overbought territory, traders should be prepared for potential volatility or a price correction.</p>
<h2>IMX Price Bounces Back: Are the Bulls Ready to Charge?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_138529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138529" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138529" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the imx chart" width="1814" height="851" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart.png 1814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-1024x480.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-768x360.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-1536x721.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138529" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/IMXUSDT/">IMXUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following a five-day retracement, the IMX price appears to be finding solid ground, bouncing off the 20-day EMA and the horizontal support zone of $1.2477 to $1.2894.</p>
<p>The technical indicators suggest that the IMX price may be on the verge of a reversal, as the current trading rate of $1.4099 indicates a 10.08% increase so far today.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the IMX price currently sits at $1.2529. This short-term EMA is comfortably above the 50-day EMA of $1.0307 and the 100-day EMA of $0.8745.</p>
<p>Typically, when the shorter-term EMA is above the long-term EMA, it&#8217;s a bullish signal.</p>
<p>In this instance, the considerable difference between the EMAs supports a potential uptrend for the IMX price.</p>
<p>The RSI has climbed from yesterday&#8217;s 58.89 to today&#8217;s 66.25, moving closer to the overbought territory (an RSI above 70).</p>
<p>While this could signal that the IMX price is overvalued, it&#8217;s important to remember that prices can remain overbought for extended periods in a strong uptrend.</p>
<p>Trading at a pivotal point, the IMX price faces a psychological resistance at the $1.50 mark, followed by the prior resistance zone of $1.5310 to $1.5888.</p>
<p>A breach of these resistance levels could indicate a continuing uptrend, providing a good opportunity for traders to enter long positions.</p>
<p>Conversely, the immediate support for the IMX price is the horizontal zone of $1.2477 to $1.2894, which is in alignment with the 20-day EMA of $1.2529.</p>
<p>If the IMX price were to fall below this support, it could signal a potential downtrend.</p>
<p>While the IMX price is currently showing bullish signs, traders should remain cautious.</p>
<p>The overbought RSI suggests a potential price correction in the future, and the negative MACD divergence could indicate bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>However, the rising price and the strong support from the 20-day EMA may counteract these signals.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the future of the IMX price will depend on whether it can break through the resistance levels or if it will fall back to the support levels.</p>
<p>Traders should keep a close eye on these key price levels and the technical indicators to make informed decisions.</p>
<h2>Breakout or Breakdown: The Next Move for Blur Price</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_138536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138536" style="width: 1811px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138536" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the blur price" width="1811" height="851" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart.png 1811w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart-1024x481.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart-768x361.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701455851-12-1-23-cn-blur-chart-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1811px) 100vw, 1811px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138536" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BLURUSDT/">BLURUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Blur price is showing a slight increase, trading at $0.5010, a 1.64% increase so far today.</p>
<p>The recent price action suggests a possibility of further downside towards its immediate support level, along with potential consolidation at the current levels before its next leg up.</p>
<p>Investors are keenly observing the marker as the technical indicators hint at the possible price trajectory in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Overlaying the EMAs on the Blur price chart indicates a bullish trend in the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA of the Blur price currently stands at $0.4583, significantly above both the 50-day EMA at $0.3671 and the 100-day EMA at $0.3205.</p>
<p>This suggests an overall bullish sentiment, with the short-term price action outperforming the long-term trend.</p>
<p>The RSI for Blur currently sits at 58.72, up from yesterday&#8217;s 57.93.</p>
<p>With the overbought level not until 70, there remains ample room for the RSI to climb before signaling the Blur price has become overstretched.</p>
<p>Traders should continue monitoring the indicator for a topping pattern that may precede a correction.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram shows a value of -0.0023, a decrease from the previous day&#8217;s 0.0010.</p>
<p>This newly formed bearish MACD crossover implies a shift in momentum, potentially signaling a short-term price decline or consolidation for the Blur price.</p>
<p>Blur price currently faces immediate resistance at the horizontal resistance zone of $0.5327 to $0.5651. A break above this level could attract further buying pressure and potentially ignite an upward trend.</p>
<p>However, the bearish MACD crossover and the RSI nearing overbought conditions suggest that this might not be an easy task for the bulls.</p>
<p>Conversely, the immediate support for the Blur price lies in the horizontal support zone of $0.4482 to $0.4719.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this zone coincides with the 20-day EMA of $0.4583, providing a strong layer of support.</p>
<p>A breach below this support could result in a short-term price decline, although the longer-term bullish sentiment may limit significant downside.</p>
<p>Given the current technical indicators, the Blur price seems to be at an inflection point.</p>
<p>While the EMA crossover suggests a bullish sentiment, the RSI and the MACD are hinting at a potential consolidation or price decline in the near term.</p>
<p>Investors and traders should closely monitor the Blur price action around the key support and resistance levels.</p>
<p>A decisive breakout or breakdown from these levels could set the tone for the next major price move.</p>
<p>Navigating the current market environment with a careful risk management strategy could be the key to capitalizing on potential opportunities.</p>
<p>With bullish momentum mounting behind TIA, IMX, and BLUR, investors are also scoping out presales for overlooked gems before exchange debuts.</p>
<h2><b>The Most Promising Bitcoin Alternatives To Buy Now</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-whales-poised-to-push-price-above-40000-will-they-succeed.htm">With Bitcoin dominating the crypto market</a>, many investors are searching for promising Bitcoin alternatives that have yet to gain mass adoption.</p>
<p>Though risky, getting in early on to select new crypto projects allows you to acquire tokens at a fraction of their future price.</p>
<p>The key is identifying platforms on the verge of solving unmet needs before widespread awareness kicks in.</p>
<p><iframe title="&#x1f525; Top 3 Cryptocurrency Presales: Your Ticket to 10X Gains! Don&#039;t Miss Out! &#x1f4b0;&#x1f680;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ffzrEB-Jqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Two bitcoin alternatives currently running <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">presales that offer excellent potential in 2023</a> are Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>Both of these bitcoin alternatives are bringing fresh ideas and seeking to disrupt their respective sectors.</p>
<p>By getting in early on these promising crypto presales, you can gain exposure to what may end up being major game-changers down the line.</p>
<p>Rather than sticking with well-known crypto juggernauts, these overlooked crypto presales allow you to invest in new bitcoin alternatives looking to shake things up.</p>
<h3><b>Bitcoin ETF Hopes Soar as BTCETF, One of the Best Cryptos to Buy Now, Surpasses $2.1 Million</b></h3>
<p>As the crypto industry awaits pivotal SEC rulings on Bitcoin ETFs, the presale token Bitcoin ETF (BTCETF) has attracted over $2.1 million amid surging optimism.</p>
<p>BTCETF is currently in stage six of its presale, with the token price starting at $0.0006.</p>
<p>The price increases incrementally with each stage, incentivizing investors to buy early before the full launch.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The project offers a unique use case, rewarding BTCETF holders upon Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p>
<p>This has sparked interest from the crypto community amid growing optimism that ETFs will finally get SEC clearance.</p>
<p>Major financial institutions like BlackRock have been meeting with regulators to align their proposed Bitcoin ETF structures with SEC requirements.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, a BlackRock <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-etfs.htm">crypto ETF</a> could bring substantial new capital into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>BTCETF utilizes deflationary tokenomics, with plans to burn 25% of the total supply when key Bitcoin ETF milestones are achieved.</p>
<p>This scarcity mechanism intends to increase the token&#8217;s value as demand rises.</p>
<p>The project also offers staking rewards up to 117% APY for locking up tokens, further limiting circulating supply as the presale progresses.</p>
<p>However, the staking return decreases as more tokens are staked.</p>
<p>BTCETF&#8217;s presale has gained strong momentum, raising over $2.1 million already.</p>
<p>With a hard cap of $5 million, the presale is entering its final days. Once this limit is reached, no additional tokens will be minted.</p>
<p>For investors looking for the best crypto to buy now while prices are still low, BTCETF presents an intriguing opportunity.</p>

<h3><b>Meme Kombat (MK): Dominate the Meme Space with the Best Crypto to Buy Now</b></h3>
<p>A new meme coin called Meme Kombat (MK) has quickly captured the crypto community&#8217;s attention, raising nearly $2.5 million so far in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>With plans to list on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/exchanges.htm">top crypto exchanges</a> soon, MK could be ready for an eventful debut.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meme Kombat brands itself as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-to-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn</a> meme coin, incorporating battle games, staking rewards, and community engagement focused on popular internet memes.</p>
<p>Users can wager the MK token on fights between characters like Doge and Pepe in game modes with set odds for rewards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the project’s staking protocol seeks to promote long-term holding rather than quick flipping after launch.</p>
<p>With meme-inspired artwork and nostalgia for crypto’s early days, Meme Kombat offers a unique platform.</p>
<p>Demand has been robust in the presale so far, with the price increasing incrementally as each stage sells out.</p>
<p>The current presale price sits over 25% higher than the initial base price.</p>
<p>Upon completion, Meme Kombat plans to list MK on top cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>Given the tendency for new meme coins to surge in price after debut listings, this signals excellent potential and upside potential for MK ahead.</p>
<p>Adding to its credibility, Meme Kombat has an experienced team led by founder Matt Whiteman, known for his work with successful ventures like Phat Loot and North Technologies.</p>
<p>The project has also received endorsements from influencers on social media, demonstrating its strong position in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>With its accountable development methodology, seasoned leadership, and exceptionally engaging platform, Meme Kombat reveals promise beyond your typical meme coin.</p>

<p>According to a November 30 filing by FTX debtors, the IRS tax claims of $24 billion filed in early November are &#8220;completely unsubstantiated&#8221; and FTX has now requested that the claims be dismissed by the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX was hit with a major setback in its bankruptcy proceedings when the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/ftx-moves-to-eliminate-24-billion-tax-claims-in-bankruptcy#:~:text=The%20IRS%20has%20filed%2047,net%20taxable%20losses%2C%20it%20said.">IRS filed the staggering tax claims last month</a>, presenting a potentially insurmountable obstacle for the exchange as it attempts to recover funds and reimburse customers.</p>
<h2>FTX Calls IRS Tax Claims &#8220;Unsubstantiated&#8221; and Motion Filed for Dismissal</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
FTX asserted that the IRS has failed to provide any factual or legal rationale to justify tax claims of such an immense magnitude, especially given FTX&#8217;s financial circumstances.</p>
<p>The filing stated that despite ongoing discussions and repeated requests, the IRS has not substantiated the basis for maintaining tax claims that vastly exceed FTX&#8217;s estimated earnings and debts. FTX argued that the IRS claims, which currently total 47 separate claims against 31 FTX debtors, were speculative and threatened to impede customer reimbursement efforts indefinitely.</p>
<p><iframe title="How The IRS Is Playing A Role In The FTX Bankruptcy Case" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/udRjjI2ts5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The scale of the IRS tax claims against FTX, among the largest ever levied by the agency, has prompted urgent legal action by the exchange. FTX contends that the unexpected tax claims of approximately $24 billion could critically impact its objective of restoring funds to customers and creditors affected by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">FTX&#8217;s shocking collapse in November 2022</a>.</p>
<p>According to analysts, IRS tax claims have the potential to completely derail <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-bankruptcy-daily-legal-costs-mount-15-million-raising-concerns-among-creditors.htm">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings</a> if not dismissed or dramatically reduced. Some experts view the claims as a potentially lethal blow to hopes of rehabilitating the exchange and question whether FTX can continue operations at all given the scale of the IRS action.</p>
<h2>FTX Complied With Over 1,100 IRS Information Requests</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/FTXTradingLtdDocketNo122bk11068BankrDDelNov112022CourtDocket/27?doc_id=X2K48SMD5H38U1RMQ67TG7SKI8L">In its motion to dismiss the IRS claims</a>, FTX revealed it has worked diligently to comply with IRS requests for information, fulfilling over 1,100 requests from IRS audit teams. FTX stated it has supplied extensive documentation to the IRS to provide transparency and determine the accuracy of the tax claims.</p>
<p>Despite FTX&#8217;s repeated efforts to obtain details supporting the IRS calculations, the agency has reportedly failed to provide a factual foundation for the extraordinary tax liability cited. FTX maintained that the absence of substantiation from the IRS indicated the claims were erroneous and inflated.</p>
<p>The IRS action against FTX adds further uncertainty to the already reeling crypto industry, which has <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sam-bankman-fried-found-guilty-and-the-crypto-industry-may-never-recover-12999151">yet to fully recover following FTX&#8217;s collapse</a>. The exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings had planned to restore the shaken confidence of crypto investors, but the enormous tax claims from the IRS present yet another complication in FTX&#8217;s attempted rehabilitation.</p>
<p>As FTX continues its uphill legal battle in the aftermath of its catastrophic collapse, the exchange is gearing up to contest the IRS claims which it views as unfounded and excessive. The outcome of FTX&#8217;s motion to dismiss the tax claims worth approximately $24 billion could determine whether the exchange can proceed with its bankruptcy reorganization or will be permanently derailed by its troubles with US tax authorities.</p>

<p>On November 30 major players in the Bitcoin mining industry, Hut 8 Mining Corp. and US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC), announced their merger to create a new entity known as Hut 8 Corp or New Hut. The news comes just months before the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event in 2024.</p>
<p>The merger brings together the 825 MW of energy across 11 sites focused on Bitcoin mining, hosting, managed services, and high-performance computing.</p>
<h2>Strategic Positioning for the Impending Bitcoin Halving</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to New Hut CEO Jaime Leverton, the combination creates the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/companies-pioneering-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.htm">largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner</a> in the world based on hash rate.</p>
<p>With the upcoming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">Bitcoin halving projected to take place in April 2024</a>, the merger is intended to strategically position the newly formed Hut 8 Corp for continued growth and efficiency gains. The halving event, which happens every four years, will cut the block reward for Bitcoin miners in half overnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;New Hut is laser-focused on driving efficiency and improvement across our spectrum of operations to ensure that we are well positioned and uniquely nimble as we approach the halving and beyond,&#8221; New Hut President Asher Genoot said in the announcement.</p>
<p><iframe title="2024 Halving Bad For Some Miners! Where Does BTC Price Need To Be For Each Miner To Be Profitable?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CXnOKd8FBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The merger allows the company to leverage economies of scale and operational expertise ahead of the major drop in revenue miners will face after the halving.</p>
<p>According to Leverton, the combined strengths will allow New Hut 8 Corp to stay resilient despite the impending challenges of the Bitcoin halving. The company seeks to continue expanding, with a pipeline of greenfield and brownfield growth opportunities.</p>
<h2>Trading Under New Stock Symbols</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Effective December 4, the shares of Hut 8 Corp will begin trading under the new ticker symbol HUT on the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hut">Nasdaq stock exchange</a> and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The merger terms dictate that shareholders of legacy Hut 8 Mining will receive 0.2 shares of New Hut common stock for each Hut 8 share. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/us-bitcoin-corp-stockholders-approve-transformational-business-combination-with-hut-8-c679adef">USBTC shareholders</a> will get 0.6716 shares of the new stock for each of their previous shares.</p>
<p>The completion of the merger marks a new chapter for the two leading Bitcoin mining companies, as they join forces and rebrand as a U.S.-based entity. Their strategic alignment ahead of the halving seeks to strengthen their position in the Bitcoin mining space.</p>

<p>The recent successful registration of IOTA&#8217;s foundation in <strong>Abu Dhabi</strong> and subsequent nearly 48% increase in <strong>IOTA&#8217;s price</strong> yesterday has positioned it among the <strong>best crypto to buy now</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from<strong> IOTA</strong>, <strong>Radix</strong> and <strong>Theta Network</strong> are making impressive market gains recently, and the <strong>crypto presales</strong> for <strong>Bitcoin ETF Token</strong> and <strong>TG.Casino</strong> are attracting a lot of attention as November comes to a close.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now in the News</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following the successful registration of its foundation in Abu Dhabi, IOTA&#8217;s native token surged, reaching a peak of $0.2899 yesterday. This new 2023 high marks the token&#8217;s highest valuation so far this year, setting a fresh year-to-date record.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The foundation&#8217;s establishment is part of a broader strategy to promote the adoption of IOTA&#8217;s Distributed Ledger Technology on a global scale.</p>
<p>Despite retracing 11% so far today, IOTA has gained nearly 38% in the last month.</p>
<p>If the cryptocurrency can bounce back and subsequently consolidate successfully at current levels, this could open the doors for further upside.</p>
<p>Bouncing off its 100-day EMA and breaking past immediate resistance, Radix&#8217;s price saw an 11.31% surge yesterday to close out the daily candle to the upside.</p>
<p>This momentum comes as short-term forecasts predict potential for a Radix rebound and retest of the token&#8217;s 0.786 Fib resistance at $0.06269 following this upside price action yesterday.</p>
<p>Theta Network&#8217;s THETA is seeing a 5.50% increase so far today, currently trading at approximately $1.017.</p>
<p>The token&#8217;s monthly performance reflects a notable near 50% rise, attributed in part to the <a href="https://twitter.com/LavitaAI/status/1724849974687695012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1724849974687695012%7Ctwgr%5E8d2282918afa7cf4cb70f6510febc3f3afeadb24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsidebitcoins.com%2Fnews%2Ftheta-network-price-prediction-theta-pumps-9-as-investors-rush-to-buy-this-bitcoin-etf-themed-alt-coin-before-it-sells-out">project&#8217;s recent community airdrops</a>.</p>
<p>Technical indicators, however, point to a possible downturn with the RSI and MACD suggesting a bearish short-term outlook.</p>
<p>The resistance at around $1.06 could signal impending selling pressure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino&#8217;s ongoing presales present opportunities for potential investment strategies, so investors may want to look into them as part of a diversified crypto portfolio.</p>
<p>As the market presents a mix of risks and opportunities, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">investors are closely monitoring these tokens for their upside potential</a>.</p>
<p>Read on for an in-depth analysis of these cryptocurrencies&#8217; technical and fundamental outlooks to determine if they may be the best crypto to buy now.</p>

<p>The IOTA price has recently caught the attention of traders following the successful registration of its foundation in Abu Dhabi. The cryptocurrency exhibited substantial gains, although it encountered a significant resistance zone that led to a retracement.</p>
<p>The IOTA price is currently striving to stabilize around the Fib 0.5 level of $0.2280, with a 10.85% downturn so far today.</p>
<p>The IOTA price is currently charting a path above its 20-day ($0.1890), 50-day ($0.1765), and 100-day ($0.1709) EMAs.</p>
<p>This positioning is typically a bullish signal, suggesting that buyers are dominating the market. If maintained, this could pave the way for the continuation of the uptrend in the near term.</p>
<p>The RSI has decreased from yesterday&#8217;s 77.04 to today&#8217;s 64.01. It shows that the IOTA price is cooling off from the overbought territory, indicating a potential period of price consolidation or even a slight price decline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the MACD histogram has increased from yesterday&#8217;s 0.0030 to a current value of 0.0044. This positive shift suggests that bullish momentum is picking up in the market, despite the recent decline in the IOTA price.</p>
<p>The IOTA price currently faces a robust horizontal resistance zone of $0.2680 to $0.2746. This resistance level was notable in the recent price rejection, and a successful break through this region could indicate a bullish trend continuation.</p>
<p>On the flip side, immediate support for the IOTA price is found in a horizontal zone of $0.2280 to $0.2313. This area also aligns with the Fib 0.5 level of $0.2280, making it a critical zone for price stabilization.</p>
<p>If the price breaches this support level, further dips could be expected, which might offer an ideal buying opportunity for investors aiming for long-term gains.</p>
<p>The current technical indicators paint a picture of uncertainty for the immediate future of the IOTA price. Despite positive momentum as per the MACD, the price is still hovering around critical support levels.</p>
<p>Traders should carefully monitor these levels and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.</p>

<p>The XRD price, after an 11.31% increase yesterday, has retraced and is trading around immediate support levels.</p>
<p>This price action indicates a potential need for further consolidation before Radix can make its next upward move.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the XRD price is currently at $0.05116, with the 50-day EMA at $0.04915 and the 100-day EMA at $0.05060.</p>
<p>Although the short-term EMA is above the long-term EMA, which is often seen as a bullish sign, the slight difference suggests caution.</p>
<p>The proximity of these EMAs indicates volatility and unpredictability in the XRD price, signaling traders to be cautious.</p>
<p>The RSI has dipped from yesterday&#8217;s 59.72 to 52.99, residing in neutral territory.</p>
<p>This suggests a balanced market sentiment, with neither the bears nor the bulls in firm control.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram, however, shows a decrease from yesterday&#8217;s 0.00024 to 0.00001, hinting at a potential bearish MACD crossover.</p>
<p>Such a crossover could intensify selling pressure on the XRD price.</p>
<p>The XRD price is currently faced with a Fib 0.618 resistance level at $0.05775. A breakthrough past this level could signal a bullish resurgence.</p>
<p>However, today&#8217;s downtrend of 7.60% and the proximity to the immediate Fib 0.5 support level at $0.05429, which was unable to hold today&#8217;s selling pressure, suggests that the XRD price may first need to consolidate around the next support zone.</p>
<p>The immediate horizontal support zone lies between $0.05079 and $0.05254, which is in alignment with the 20-day EMA at $0.05116.</p>
<p>This confluence strengthens the potential support at this level. If the selling pressure continues and this support fails to hold, traders might anticipate a deeper correction.</p>
<p>The future of the XRD price seems to hinge on its consolidation around the current support levels.</p>
<p>While the neutral RSI suggests a balanced market sentiment, a potential bearish MACD crossover could increase selling pressure.</p>
<p>Traders should watch for a bounce off the $0.05116 level for potential buying opportunities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a break below this level could set the stage for further declines.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the XRD price appears to be in a critical phase of consolidation before it can embark on its next potential upward journey.</p>
<h2>THETA Price Prediction: Can the Bullish Trend Continue?</h2>

<figure id="attachment_138191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138191" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138191" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the theta price" width="1814" height="847" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart.png 1814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-1024x478.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-768x359.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-1536x717.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138191" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/THETAUSDT/">THETAUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The THETA price has been displaying a promising trend for the past few days, with the coin continuing its consolidation above the 20-day EMA.</p>
<p>As it edges closer to its immediate resistance level, the THETA price currently stands at $1.017 &#8211; an increase of 5.50% so far today.</p>
<p>Looking at the EMAs reveals a compelling narrative.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for THETA stands at $0.940, comfortably outperforming the 50-day and 100-day EMAs at $0.846 and $0.782, respectively.</p>
<p>This paints a robust picture of bullishness in THETA&#8217;s immediate future.</p>
<p>Looking at the RSI, it has risen to 62.74 from yesterday&#8217;s 57.51.</p>
<p>An RSI above 50 often suggests that a stock or coin is in a bullish phase, meaning the THETA price might see further upward movement.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram has also shown a positive change, moving to -0.006 from yesterday&#8217;s -0.009.</p>
<p>The narrowing of the MACD histogram indicates that the bearish momentum is slowly losing its grip and a bullish crossover could be expected soon, which would likely propel the THETA price further.</p>
<p>Examining the immediate resistance, the horizontal resistance zone is between $1.087 and $1.103.</p>
<p>This level was retested earlier today when THETA traded around its intraday high of $1.085.</p>
<p>A break and close above this resistance could potentially spark a new uptrend for the THETA price.</p>
<p>On the flip side, immediate support is found in the horizontal support zone of $0.931 to $0.943, aligning closely with the 20-day EMA of $0.940.</p>
<p>Holding this support is crucial for THETA to maintain its upward journey.</p>
<p>A break below this could lead to a retest of the 50-day EMA at $0.846, potentially opening up a more bearish phase for the THETA price.</p>
<p>While the THETA price shows strong bullish sentiment, traders should keep a close eye on these technical indicators and key support and resistance levels.</p>
<p>The coming days will reveal whether THETA can sustain its upward momentum or if a reversal is on the horizon.</p>
<p>As IOTA, Radix, and Theta Network show signs of momentum, attention is turning to overlooked crypto presales like Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>These fresh projects seek to capitalize on the hype surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF and the growing excitement around crypto gambling.</p>
<p>Their early traction suggests these may be smart investments for those seeking viable Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<h2>Overlooked Bitcoin Alternatives With Upside Potential in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As Bitcoin continues to lead the cryptocurrency market, investors are starting to explore lesser-known alternatives that have yet to gain mass adoption.</p>
<p>While risky, investing in select new crypto projects early allows you to acquire tokens at a fraction of their possible future price.</p>
<p>The key is identifying platforms that are on the verge of solving unmet needs or current problems before widespread awareness kicks in.</p>
<p>Two <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">ongoing crypto presales that offer excellent investment potential in 2023</a> are Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>Both projects are bringing fresh ideas to the table and seek to disrupt their respective sectors.</p>
<p>Getting in early with these promising crypto alternatives provides an opportunity to get exposure to what may end up being major innovations down the line.</p>
<p>Looking past crypto juggernauts, these unnoticed crypto presales offer the ability to invest in new Bitcoin alternatives seeking to shake things up.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin ETF Token Presale Raises Over $2 Million as Investors Rush to Buy One of the Best Crypto to Buy Now</h3>
<p>As the crypto community awaits a decision on spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a new project called Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) aims to capitalize on the hype.</p>
<p>With major players like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">BlackRock</a> and Grayscale seeking approval for bitcoin ETFs, excitement is building around these potential new investment vehicles.</p>
<p>BTCETF has timed its roadmap and tokenomics to align with key milestones in the spot Bitcoin ETF approval process.</p>

<p>The BTCETF presale has raised over $2 million so far, offering early investors a chance to buy tokens at a discount.</p>
<p>The pre-sale utilizes a tier-based pricing structure, with the price per token increasing through 10 stages from an initial $0.005 to $0.0068.</p>
<p>According to the BTCETF whitepaper, the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could unlock billions in institutional investment.</p>
<p>To capitalize on this opportunity, BTCETF incorporates a deflationary mechanism that seeks to increase token scarcity and value.</p>
<p>Specifically, it will burn 5% of the total supply each time an ETF milestone is reached.</p>
<p>In addition to burning tokens, BTCETF also uses a staking system to incentivize users, gradually decreasing token circulation over time.</p>
<p>Through these dual tactics of token burning and staking rewards, BTCETF intends to reward long-term holders by decreasing transaction taxes from an initial 5% to 0% after all ETF milestones have been achieved.</p>

<h3>TG.Casino Presale Hits $3.1 Million, Is it the Best Crypto to Buy Now?</h3>
<p>The ongoing presale for TG.Casino, a new crypto casino built on Telegram, has hit the $3.1 million raised milestone so far.</p>
<p>With  less than $2 million left until the presale&#8217;s completion, the project continues to generate a lot of hype.</p>
<p>TG.Casino enables anonymous crypto gambling directly within Telegram, bringing privacy and efficiency to the messaging app.</p>
<p>Over 2,300 gamblers have tried it, wagering over $30 million total already.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>TG.Casino has recently shared its post-presale roadmap which includes expanded marketing, team growth, product enhancements, and a goal of $225 million total wagering volume.</p>
<p>Several prominent crypto influencers have endorsed TG.Casino, <a href="https://twitter.com/littlemustacho/status/1726692645806703010">including analyst Little Mustacho</a>, who believes the project has the potential to directly compete with the popular crypto gambling site Rollbit.</p>
<p>Seasoned analysts forecast the token&#8217;s price may rapidly increase following the project&#8217;s introduction to the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>TG.Casino’s ingenious tokenomics further incentivize long-term holding of its $TGC token.</p>
<p>Owners can benefit from perks like cashback to offset losses, reward programs for activity, and an intuitive buyback system designed to make $TGC deflationary over time.</p>
<p>As the presale nears its finish line, some believe TG.Casino could be a leading crypto opportunity given its novel platform and early traction indicators.</p>
<p>Additionally, the presale price increases in less than two days, so interested investors may want to review soon before token prices rise.</p>
<p>With crypto gambling picking up steam, TG.Casino&#8217;s Telegram-based model and presale traction signal its strong potential as the presale heads toward its finish line.</p>
<p>For investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, TG.Casino appears to be one to watch closely.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence has become integral across industries, transforming how businesses operate. The crypto sector is no exception, with AI powering innovation in trading strategies. As algorithms become more advanced, traders&#8217; expectations for robust analytics and predictions will continue to increase. Platforms leveraging AI to its fullest in crypto stand to thrive amidst this progress.</p>
<p>One project gaining attention for comprehensively targeting traders&#8217; needs with AI is yPredict. Through a presale exceeding $5 million raised so far, yPredict positioned itself as a promising contender in the AI crypto space.</p>
<p>As YPRED is moving toward its $6.5 million hard cap, the presale price is rising with each stage. Early adopters paid just $0.07 per token, while the current tier sits at $0.11.

<h2>Actionable Trading Insights at Crypto&#8217;s Cutting Edge</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At its core, yPredict will use AI algorithms to generate <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">trading signals</a> and strategies. Traders can use these insights via dashboards and tools integrated with exchanges.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform will aggregate relevant crypto datasets for further analytics, including prices, on-chain data, sentiment, technical indicators, and more. The goal is to provide diverse insights to inform trading decisions.</p>
<p>Beyond analytics, yPredict will also have an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-marketplaces.htm">NFT marketplace</a> for buying, selling, and minting. Through a multifaceted product suite, the YPRED token will unlock access to all platform capabilities.</p>
<h2>Gem AI Crypto: Small Cap, Big Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite recent presale progress, yPredict is still a relatively small player today. Its market capitalization stands at just $6.5 million<b>—</b>dwarfed by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-crypto-coins.htm">rivals valued from $50 million to over $100 million</a>.</p>
<p>yPredict is betting on product depth rather than just size, however. With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/11/01/beyond-generative-ai-four-cutting-edge-ai-advancements-primed-to-transform-businesses/">AI advancements</a> rapidly accelerating, the project wants to compete by leveraging cutting-edge technology.</p>

<p>Recent integrations between tools like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-3-is-now-available-in-chatgpt-plus-and-enterprise">ChatGPT and DALL-E 3</a> showcase AI&#8217;s versatility for content and operations. Aligning with this proliferation, yPredict launched its AI writing assistant <a href="https://writemingle.com/">WriteMingle</a>, demonstrating the project&#8217;s commitment to diversified offerings.</p>
<p>While still in its early stages, yPredict&#8217;s presale performance and diverse product suite establish it as a promising AI crypto contender. As artificial intelligence sees increased adoption, it is primed to drive substantial transformation across the crypto sector.</p>

<p>Mummolin, a Bitcoin startup, has raised $6.2 million in seed funding to support the launch of Ocean, a new decentralized bitcoin mining pool. The funding round was led by former Twitter CEO and Bitcoin advocate Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>OCEAN mining pool seeks to shift power back to Bitcoin miners by enabling them to receive block rewards directly from the network, without the <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-bitcoin-mining-centralization/">risks posed by centralized mining pools</a>.</p>
<h2>How OCEAN Differs from Traditional Mining Pools</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In conventional Bitcoin mining pools, the pool operator takes custody of the rewards and distributes them to miners. This means the pool can potentially withhold payments or censor certain transactions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">“she thought it was the ocean…it’s just the pool” <a href="https://t.co/iGXrNNrhiZ">https://t.co/iGXrNNrhiZ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;Ocean&#8217;s non-custodial payouts directly to miners from the block reward remove this risk and the pool&#8217;s undue influence over miners,&#8221; Mummolin&#8217;s president <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jack-dorsey-leads-seed-round-in-support-of-oceans-mission-to-decentralize-bitcoin-mining-globally---announces-launch-at-future-of-bitcoin-mining-conference-301999073.html">Mark Artymko said in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, Ocean will be the first fully <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/demand-launches-bitcoin-mining-pool-with-stratum-v2-promises-improved-security-and-performance.htm">decentralized Bitcoin mining pool</a>, paying miners directly in a transparent manner. Miners on Ocean will get the new block reward straight from the Bitcoin network, without interference from any centralized entity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency,&#8221; long-time Bitcoin developer and Mummulin co-founder Luke Dashjr stated.</p>
<h2>Support from Bitcoin and Web3 Leaders</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In addition to Jack Dorsey&#8217;s lead investment, Ocean&#8217;s seed funding round included investments from several high-profile Bitcoin and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-46-5-of-web3-fund-loss-is-result-of-traditional-web2-security-issues-investment-in-blockchain-gaming-hits-1-5-billion-in-2023.htm">Web3 funds</a> such as Accomplice, Barefoot Bitcoin Fund, MoonKite, and NewLayer Capital.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The old code has already been updated and tested with support for the latest Bitcoin addresses and mining machines.</p>
<p>As was the case with Eligius, OCEAN is a non-custodial pool paying miners directly with generated coins, and it provides the highest level of transparency both in…</p>
<p>&mdash; Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1729900023486337319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The decentralized mining pool has also received praise from leading industry experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mining pool with more decentralization built into it at the foundation, which in my opinion is good for the Bitcoin network,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1729904579863609443">tweeted Lyn Alden</a>, founder of investment advisory firm Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.</p>
<p>With its emphasis on miner transparency and decentralization, Ocean plans to embody the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/13/new-study-investigates-bitcoin-as-a-tool-against-financial-censorship/">censorship resistance and peer-to-peer principles</a> that many view as core Bitcoin values.</p>
<p>The launch of Ocean comes at a time when censorship by large mining pools has caused controversy. Most recently, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/social-media-speculates-if-f2pool-is-censoring-transactions-founder-responds.htm">F2Pool faced backlash for allegedly censoring transactions</a> from a sanctioned address.</p>
<p>As a new entry into the Bitcoin mining pool scene, Ocean will be closely watched by industry observers to evaluate if its model of direct payouts and non-custodial structure can effectively shift influence away from centralized intermediaries and back towards empowering individual miners through enhanced transparency and decentralization.</p>

<p>The anonymous attacker behind the recent $47 million exploit of the decentralized crypto exchange KyberSwap has outlined bold demands in proposed negotiation terms made public on November 30. The self-proclaimed &#8220;Kyber Director&#8221; is seeking complete control of KyberSwap&#8217;s operations and assets to remedy the losses from the November 23 breach.</p>
<h2>Kyber Director Seeks Broad Authority Over KyberSwap Governance and Assets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0479da9d6a3a29b294d6337630ea0a482e7ec7223f3b6e6d72442f6c450264d4">According to the statement shared via Ethereum transaction</a>, Kyber Director is demanding full executive authority over KyberSwap as a company, including temporary ownership of the governance mechanism to enact protocol changes. The exploiter also called for all documents and data related to KyberSwap&#8217;s structure, finances, and intellectual property to be handed over.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Kybeer hacker is schizo AF holy shit <a href="https://t.co/eV7tgsjx5d">pic.twitter.com/eV7tgsjx5d</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In addition, Kyber Director requested the surrender of all on-chain and off-chain assets tied to the company, encompassing equity, tokens, partnerships, websites, social channels, and any other properties associated with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">decentralized exchange</a>.</p>
<h2>Employee Benefits and Token Holder Rebates Offered in Return</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In return for meeting these demands by December 10, Kyber Director pledged certain concessions to employees, investors, and liquidity providers of KyberSwap. Executives would receive a buyout at a fair valuation, while other employees could expect doubled salaries under the new leadership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, token holders would benefit from a full protocol overhaul to improve KyberSwap&#8217;s market standing. The exploiter also promised a 50% rebate on recent losses to liquidity providers stemming from the attack. The deal risks collapse if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-blockchain-technology-empowers-law-enforcement-crypto-investigations.htm">law enforcement intervenes</a>, however.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kyberswap hacker saw the OpenAI coup and said hold my beer</p>
<p>&mdash; loomdart &#8211; (FTX 2.0 Advocate) (@loomdart) <a href="https://twitter.com/loomdart/status/1730200088985645411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;This is my best offer. This is my only offer. I require my demands to be met by December 10, otherwise, the treaty falls through,&#8221; Kyber Director stated in the negotiations. &#8220;Additionally, should I be contacted by agents from any of the 206 sovereignties, concerning the trades I placed on Kyber, the treaty falls through. In this case, rebates will total to exactly 0.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bold proposal was released after <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/264756/kyberswap-recovers-4-7-million-after-exploit#:~:text=Decentralized%20exchange%20protocol%20KyberSwap%20has,concentrated%20liquidity%20pools%20last%20week.">KyberSwap recovered approximately $4.67 million</a> from frontrunning bots that capitalized on the breach. The decentralized exchange said it continues collaborating with authorities to track down more exploited assets.</p>
<p>While risky, the proposed treaty could mitigate the far-reaching effects of last week’s exploit. Yet handing over full control to the anonymous attacker presents deep governance concerns for a prominent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-lender-exactly-protocol-exploited-for-12-million.htm">DeFi protocol</a>.</p>
<p>KyberSwap now faces a complex decision between recovering additional funds and setting a dangerous precedent of bowing to an exploiter’s demands. With the December 10 deadline looming, the community awaits KyberSwap’s official response to the brazen negotiation attempt.</p>

<p>Michael Saylor, billionaire CEO of enterprise analytics firm MicroStrategy, has once again demonstrated his unwavering commitment to Bitcoin by purchasing an additional $593 million worth of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1730222828270612851">In a tweet posted on November 30</a>, Saylor revealed that MicroStrategy acquired <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/financial-documents/microstrategy-acquires-additional-16130-bitcoins-and-now-holds-174530-btc_11-30-2023">16,130 Bitcoins at an average price of $36,785</a> per coin. This brings the company&#8217;s total Bitcoin holdings to 174,530 BTC purchased for approximately $5.28 billion at an average price of $30,252 per Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin Hoard Continues to Grow</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With this latest purchase, MicroStrategy has further expanded its position as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/michael-saylors-btc-investment-crosses-1b-in-unrealized-profits.htm">the single largest institutional holder of Bitcoin</a>. The company now holds over 0.83% of the maximum 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist.</p>
<p>No other publicly traded company comes close to MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin allocation. The next biggest corporate holder, <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1328/marathon-digital-holdings-adds-new-enterprise-grade">Marathon Digital, has amassed just 13,726 BTC</a> worth about $517 million at current prices.</p>
<p>Saylor has frequently explained his ultra bullish case for Bitcoin on Twitter, in interviews, and at conferences. He believes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptocurrency-adoption-skyrockets-in-south-and-central-asia-driven-by-real-world-use-cases-chainalysis.htm">BTC will enjoy growing adoption</a> as a hard asset like gold and will continue appreciating in value over the long term as more institutions and nation states accumulate holdings.</p>

<p>Many experts think approval of a spot <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-btc-can-head-higher-in-2024.-heres-why">Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. could be the next catalyst</a> to spur major Wall Street inflows into BTC and propel prices higher.</p>
<h2>Growing Optimism Around a Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are currently multiple <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-attract-3b-on-first-day-and-up-to-55b-over-five-years-analysts.htm">Bitcoin ETF applications pending</a> before the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has rejected filings in the past, but recent developments suggest the regulatory agency may be warming up to finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/08/us-sec-said-to-open-talks-with-grayscale-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-push/">The SEC is now in talks with Grayscale</a> about potentially converting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF product. This is being interpreted as a hugely positive sign by the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>The prospect of an imminent Bitcoin spot ETF approval, combined with Bitcoin&#8217;s inherent scarcity and increasing real-world utility, has ignited <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-traders-remain-bullish-despite-recent-dips-here-are-key-levels-to-watch.htm">bullish sentiment</a> over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>As market optimism grows, Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy have once again expanded their Bitcoin treasury while prices are still perceived to be low. With their holdings now exceeding $6 billion in value, they stand well positioned to benefit from any future appreciation in the price of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>With a nearly 11% surge on yesterday&#8217;s close and a new 5-month high reached earlier today, the <strong>STX price</strong> has caught the market&#8217;s attention, establishing itself as one of the <strong>best crypto to buy now</strong>.</p>
<p>While <strong>Stacks</strong> shows the potential for further gains, <strong>THORChain</strong> and <strong>Celestia</strong> have also made headlines with their market movements and technological advancements.</p>
<p>Adding to the dynamic are crypto presales like <strong>Meme Kombat</strong> and <strong>TG.Casino</strong>, which are gaining a lot of attention amidst their ongoing crypto presales.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now in the News</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On the trading front, Stacks (STX) has experienced a notable increase in price, reaching $0.788 as of the latest reports.</p>
<p>Analysts are observing Stacks for a potential price rally, with price targets hovering around the $1.25 mark, propelled by its successful retest of the 200-day EMA and surpassing the $0.70 threshold.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency&#8217;s integration on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitforex-empower-the-industry-with-innovations-7799.htm">BitForex exchange</a> in November provided a fresh platform for STX deposits and trading, signifying its expanding market presence.</p>
<p>Stacks&#8217; utility as a Bitcoin Layer for smart contracts has further solidified its role in the market by facilitating the use of Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain for transactions in decentralized applications.</p>
<p>THORChain&#8217;s native token, RUNE, has likewise seen a surge, boasting a 56% increase in price on November 17, which led to it trading at $6.09.</p>
<p>This gain coincided with THORChain&#8217;s rise to the third-largest decentralized exchange by trading volume, a significant milestone for the platform.</p>
<p>The introduction of a lending feature in August has proven to be a substantial boon for THORChain, not only enhancing its liquidity but also propelling its adoption rates.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s liquidity volume has soared past the $1 billion mark, and analysts are anticipating the token&#8217;s price could climb to $7 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>The third quarter underscored THORChain&#8217;s growing influence with a sharp increase in trading volume and liquidity fees.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Celestia&#8217;s token, TIA, is posting a striking 168% increase in price so far in November.</p>
<p>Although analysts caution about the volatility that such a steep ascent may imply, TIA&#8217;s growth has put it squarely in the sights of many investors.</p>
<p>This price movement is partly attributable to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/weekly-update-investor-interest-peaks-in-celestia-and-borroefinance-amid-continued-market-success.htm">announcement by Lumoz to inaugurate its service on Celestia&#8217;s Data Availability and Polygon SDK</a>, facilitating the integration of Ethereum-based applications.</p>
<p>Such strategic partnerships have been pivotal in TIA&#8217;s recent price surge, though the market is advised to watch for potential corrections following the sharp increase.</p>
<p>At the same time as mainstream cryptocurrencies establish their foothold, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">new cryptocurrency projects</a> like Meme Kombat and TG.Casino are gaining traction during their ongoing presales.</p>
<p>As investors consider the best crypto to buy now, these initiatives are being monitored for their potential to shake up the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2>Stacks (STX) Price Hits Resistance: What&#8217;s Next for Traders?</h2>

<figure id="attachment_137791" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137791" style="width: 1815px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137791" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the stx price" width="1815" height="849" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart.png 1815w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart-1024x479.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart-768x359.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293155-11-29-23-cn-stx-chart-1536x718.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1815px) 100vw, 1815px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137791" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/STXUSDT/">STXUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Stacks (STX) has recently captured the attention of cryptocurrency traders as its price surged to a new 5-month high of $0.7989 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Despite facing immediate selling pressure around this resistance level, the STX price is still managing to uphold a 2.90% gain so far today, trading at $0.7449.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the STX price currently stands at $0.6618, comfortably above the 50-day EMA of $0.6280 and the 100-day EMA of $0.6000.</p>
<p>These upwardly aligned EMAs suggest a strong bullish trend in the STX price, offering a positive sign for investors.</p>
<p>However, the rapid ascent of the STX price warrants caution, as it may be due for a minor correction or consolidation.</p>
<p>The RSI has increased from yesterday&#8217;s 62.01 to a current level of 64.34.</p>
<p>While it is not in the overbought territory yet (an RSI above 70), it indicates increasing bullish momentum.</p>
<p>This could drive the STX price higher in the near term, but traders should be cautious of a potential reversal as the RSI approaches the overbought zone.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp">MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</a> histogram has also shown a positive progression, moving from yesterday&#8217;s 0.0048 to 0.0085.</p>
<p>This suggests that the bullish momentum is gaining strength and could propel the STX price further upwards.</p>
<p>The immediate resistance zone for the STX price lies between $0.7752 and $0.7967, which coincides with the reverse Fib 0.786 level of $0.7804.</p>
<p>This was evident earlier today when the STX price touched an intraday high of $0.7989 before experiencing a sell-off.</p>
<p>A successful breakout above this resistance could bring further bullish momentum.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the STX price has a support zone between $0.6845 and $0.7100, aligning with the Fib 0.618 level of $0.6997.</p>
<p>This support level could provide a safety net for the STX price in case of a downward correction, preventing a steep decline.</p>
<p>Given the current bullish momentum, the STX price seems to be in a strong position.</p>
<p>However, traders should monitor the RSI and MACD closely for any signs of a reversal.</p>
<p>A potential sell-off could occur if the STX price fails to break through the immediate resistance, whereas a successful breakout could lead to another bullish rally.</p>
<h2>RUNE Price Surges: Technical Indicators Point Towards Promising Trajectory</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_137792" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137792" style="width: 1815px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137792" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the rune price" width="1815" height="848" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart.png 1815w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart-1024x478.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart-768x359.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701293890-11-29-23-cn-rune-chart-1536x718.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1815px) 100vw, 1815px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137792" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/RUNEUSDT/">RUNEUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The price of THORChain&#8217;s RUNE looks set to tally three back-to-back winning days amid improving market conditions and trading activity.</p>
<p>Having bounced off its immediate support zone, RUNE is currently attempting a breakout from its resistance level of $5.860 to $6.159, and is trading at $6.351, up by 5.97%  so far today. The RUNE price seems to be on a promising trajectory, but what do the technical indicators suggest?</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the RUNE price is currently at $5.218, which is significantly higher than the 50-day EMA of $4.084, and far above the 100-day EMA of $3.123.</p>
<p>This relatively wide gap between the short-term and long-term EMAs is often perceived as a bullish sign, suggesting a strong upward trend.</p>
<p>The RSI is at 67.80, up from yesterday&#8217;s 64.93. This is a considerable increase and is approaching the overbought territory, indicating that the RUNE price might be due for a correction.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram is at -0.042, an increase from yesterday&#8217;s -0.083. This shrinking negative value hints at a potential bullish sentiment gaining strength, which could further influence the upward trajectory of the RUNE price.</p>
<p>The RUNE price is currently trading around its immediate resistance zone of $5.860 to $6.159, with an overhead resistance of $7.464 to $7.770. A successful breakout from these resistance levels could signal a continued upward trend.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the RUNE price has an immediate support zone between $5.029 and $5.253. This zone is in confluence with the Fib 0.236 level of $5.249 and the 20-day EMA of $5.218.</p>
<p>If the RUNE price manages to stay above this support level, it could provide a solid foundation for further upward movement.</p>
<p>However, traders should keep in mind that while the current situation seems promising, the overbought RSI suggests caution. It could mean that the RUNE price is due for a correction in the near term.</p>
<p>Traders should be prepared for potential volatility, and make decisions based on a combination of technical indicators, market trends, and their risk tolerance.</p>

<p>The TIA price remains a primary focus among cryptocurrency traders, as the cryptocurrency shows signs of stalling.</p>
<p>The Celestia (TIA) price currently sits at $6.1659, reflecting a 1.15% decrease so far today.</p>
<p>Despite the downturn, the technical indicators reveal interesting insights that could help traders navigate the coming days.</p>
<p>From a broader perspective, the 20-day EMA for TIA stands at $5.1384.</p>
<p>In typical scenarios, a price above the short-term EMA is indicative of a bullish trend.</p>
<p>However, with the TIA price struggling near its immediate resistance level, traders may need to tread carefully.</p>
<p>The immediate resistance level, coinciding with the Fib 0.236 level, stands at $6.2092.</p>
<p>Recent sessions have seen the TIA price battle this boundary, but a convincing breakout remains elusive.</p>
<p>This resistance level can act as a critical inflection point.</p>
<p>If the TIA price manages to breach this level convincingly, it could signal the beginning of a bullish phase.</p>
<p>However, a firm rejection from this level could send TIA back into its previous consolidation range.</p>
<p>The RSI for TIA is currently at 61.96, slightly down from yesterday&#8217;s 62.73.</p>
<p>With the current RSI value, TIA is neither in the overbought nor oversold region, providing no clear directional bias.</p>
<p>On the downside, TIA has an immediate support zone in the range of $5.1260 to $5.4565, which aligns closely with the Fib 0.382 level of $5.4548 and the 20-day EMA.</p>
<p>If the bearish pressure pushes the TIA price below this crucial support zone, it could lead to further price depreciation.</p>
<p>The TIA price currently exists in a precarious position. It&#8217;s teetering between a potential bullish breakout and a return to its prior consolidation phase.</p>
<p>Traders need to keep a close eye on both the resistance and support levels. A breakthrough on either side could dictate the TIA price direction in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Despite the current price decline, the TIA price remains above the 20-day EMA, suggesting an overarching bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>However, the immediate resistance level remains a significant hurdle.</p>
<p>While traders watch STX, RUNE, and TIA price action, overlooked crypto presales also offer a chance to diversify portfolios.</p>
<p>Two presales gaining traction are Meme Kombat and TG.Casino, which offers unique value propositions for early adopters.</p>
<h2><strong>Overlooked Bitcoin Alternatives With Upside Potential</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As Bitcoin retains its dominant position in the crypto market, investors are exploring lesser-known Bitcoin alternatives yet to gain widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Though risky, buying into select new cryptocurrencies early allows you to get tokens at a fraction of their possible future value.</p>
<p>The key is spotting projects on the cusp of addressing unmet needs or current problems before mass awareness.</p>
<p>Two such crypto projects, Meme Kombat and TG.Casino, offers some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presale opportunities in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Their low presale pricing gives investors a chance to acquire tokens early before exponential growth potentially occurs down the line.</p>
<p>For crypto investors seeking overlooked alternatives, these emerging presales offer a way to get in early on what could end up being major disruptors.</p>
<h3>Elevate Your Play-to-Earn Experience with Meme Kombat, the Best Crypto to Buy Now</h3>
<p>Meme Kombat brings its unique brand of meme-themed fighting gameplay to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/16-best-crypto-games-to-play-in-cur_year.htm">expanding play-to-earn gaming market</a>.</p>
<p>The game has already scored over $2 million from presales of the MK token, which will allow fans to battle as their favorite meme coin characters.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat seeks to take the P2E model popularized by games like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-play-axie-infinity.htm">Axie Infinity</a> and apply it to meme coins.</p>

<p>Meme Kombat plans to leverage <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-data-shows-crypto-whales-are-accumulating-this-lesser-known-ai-coin-heres-why.htm">artificial intelligence</a> for the platform&#8217;s graphics and gameplay.</p>
<p>Fight outcomes will be determined based on meme fighter strengths, incorporating game mechanics for balanced results.</p>
<p>All battle and betting data will be immutably recorded on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The project has laid out a roadmap based on content seasons, a model common in modern video games.</p>
<p>More features and battle modes will be added over time to keep players engaged. A strong community will be key to achieving mainstream success.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat&#8217;s unique mixture of meme culture and blockchain technology positions it well to capture interest in the current market.</p>
<p>With meme coins remaining immensely popular, now could be an opportune time for the project to gain traction.</p>
<p>While predictions are still preliminary given the presale status, Meme Kombat outlines ambitious plans to leverage AI and implement engaging gameplay modes over time.</p>
<p>If executed successfully, this could foster an active community essential for achieving mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>For investors on the hunt for the best crypto to buy now, Meme Kombat presents an appealing opportunity worth looking at.</p>

<h3>TG.Casino’s $TGC Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now for Crypto Gamblers and Investors</h3>
<p>With its token presale in the late stages, TG.Casino, a crypto gambling site built on Telegram, has gained major momentum over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>With only $2 million remaining in the presale out of a hard cap of $5 million, investors are quickly snapping up the platform&#8217;s native $TGC token before prices increase further.</p>
<p>The project has already raised $3 million to date, with contributors able to immediately stake their newly purchased tokens to earn up to a 187.75% APY.</p>
<p>There are also exclusive rewards for buyers who contribute $5,000 or more during the presale.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1177376/global-casinos-online-gambling-industry/">According to data analytics firm Statista</a>, the online gambling market was valued at $262 billion in 2021, with crypto gambling representing just 1% currently.</p>
<p>TG.Casino is well-positioned to capitalize on this fast-growing sector with its pioneering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-telegram-bots.htm">Telegram-based platform</a>.</p>
<p>The project boasts a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12kg38g_fFhXXrwD9kqiwOhH31Reu1ffP/view">gambling license from Curacao</a> and has undergone audits, giving investors confidence in its legitimacy.</p>
<p>Top crypto influencers have also endorsed TG.Casino, believing it could be the best crypto to buy now as it could emulate the success of Rollbit, another crypto gambling coin that rose over 5,000% after launch.</p>
<p>TG.Casino offers unique benefits over competitors like staking rewards, a buyback mechanism to boost the value of its token, and special NFT rewards for high-rollers.</p>
<p>With presale prices rising every 5 days until sellout, analysts say now is the optimal time to invest in this first-of-its-kind GameFi platform.</p>
<p>As the next crypto bull market looms, projects like TG.Casino stand to benefit from sector growth and influxes of new capital.</p>
<p>With revenues already flowing in, TG.Casino represents a presale opportunity in a revenue-generating firm with major expansion potential.</p>

<p>Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced today in a blog post that it will end support for its Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin on December 15. The move comes after regulators ordered BUSD issuer Paxos to halt minting of the stablecoin earlier this year.</p>
<p>To aid the transition away from BUSD, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-regarding-the-removal-of-busd-and-conversion-of-busd-to-fdusd-1c98ce7bb464422dbbaeda7066ae445b">Binance will automatically convert</a> any remaining BUSD balances to First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin after December 31. Users are encouraged to withdraw or convert their BUSD holdings prior to the December 15 deadline.</p>
<h2>Background on BUSD and Regulatory Action</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Launched in 2019, BUSD is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is issued by Paxos Trust Company and was endorsed by Binance to become a popular stablecoin option on its exchange.</p>
<p>In February 2023 the New York Department of Financial Services <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/alerts/Paxos_and_Binance#:~:text=DFS%20has%20ordered%20Paxos%20to,regard%20to%20Paxos%2Dissued%20BUSD.">(NYDFS) ordered Paxos to stop minting new BUSD</a>, however, citing concerns over its reserves. The regulatory crackdown led <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-drop-support-for-busd-stablecoin-by-2024.htm">Binance to announce it would “gradually” end support for BUSD</a> back in August.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> BUSD delisting from Binance</p>
<p>if you hold BUSD, get out to be safe<br />we don’t need another stablecoin depegging <a href="https://t.co/VfgFlHvddp">pic.twitter.com/VfgFlHvddp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; borovik.eth (@3orovik) <a href="https://twitter.com/3orovik/status/1729949873313550517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While existing BUSD will be redeemable through February 2024, Binance has set December deadlines to halt trading and withdraw BUSD from its platform.</p>
<p>The discontinuation includes removing BUSD trading pairs and halting deposits on various networks. Binance will also disable BUSD withdrawals starting December 31 at 3:00 AM UTC. At that time, any remaining BUSD balances will be automatically converted to FDUSD.</p>
<h2>Transition to FDUSD</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://firstdigitallabs.com/about/">FDUSD was launched by FD121 Limited</a>, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-headquartered financial firm First Digital Limited earlier this year.</p>
<p>Binance is attempting to make the transition seamless by enabling 1:1 conversion of BUSD to FDUSD through December 31. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/review_categories/exchanges/">exchange</a> will halt trading BUSD pairs in phases leading up to the December 15 deadline.</p>
<p><iframe title="Binance To Halt BUSD Will Affect XRP SHIB &amp; ADA" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyphn5SrGFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>After that date, Binance will resume BUSD deposits but automatically convert balances to FDUSD, giving users a limited time to withdraw their BUSD to external wallets.</p>
<p>The BUSD phase-out is part of Binance’s shifting stance towards compliance with global regulators. The newly appointed CEO Richard Teng stated his intention <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/binance-enters-new-era-as-ceo-richard-teng-prioritizes-transparency-compliance">to bring Binance into full regulatory compliance</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binances-new-ceo-teng-commits-to-more-regulatory-collaboration-is-this-a-new-chapter-for-binance.htm">Teng replaced founder Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao as CEO</a> of Binance’s main entity last week, following <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">CZ&#8217;s resignation and guilty plea</a> to violating criminal U.S. anti-money laundering requirements.</p>
<p>Binance hopes to put its regulatory troubles behind it and rebuild trust in key markets such as the United States.</p>
<p>Ending support for BUSD reflects Binance&#8217;s evolving stance as pressure mounts from global regulators. The exchange stopped short of immediately converting all BUSD balances to FDUSD, however.</p>
<p>Instead, Binance is giving users time to manage their stablecoin holdings independently. The phased removal of BUSD suggests that Binance hopes to maintain its huge user base by minimizing disruption.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex announced today that it will begin gradually resuming withdrawal and deposit services starting November 30. This comes after the platform suffered a major hack on November 10 resulting in an estimated $100 million loss.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1729816178225537249?s=20">In a recent X post</a>, Poloniex said it will first re-enable deposits and withdrawals for TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain founded by Justin Sun. Tron support will go live at 2 AM UTC on November 30. Over the next two weeks, Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, and additional cryptocurrencies will be reintroduced on a phased schedule to ensure the safety of user funds.</p>
<h2>Precautions After Poloniex Hack</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/19414394314519">Poloniex advised users</a> to only deposit to the newly updated wallet addresses once live, warning that funds sent to old addresses may not be credited. The exchange likely implemented new wallets as a precaution following the exploits.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4e2.png" alt="📢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Poloniex Announcement:</p>
<p>Our deposit and withdrawal services will gradually resume from November 30th, 2023, at 02:00 (UTC).</p>
<p>We&#39;ll implement a phased approach starting with enabled TRX deposits and withdrawals, followed by BTC, ETH, USDT, and more within the next two weeks.… <a href="https://t.co/yKFZSQvnJr">pic.twitter.com/yKFZSQvnJr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) <a href="https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1729816178225537249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Upcoming Airdrop for Poloniex Users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a move to restore confidence, Poloniex also announced an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-airdrops.htm">upcoming airdrop</a> for users who keep holdings on the exchange. The airdrop, developed together with HTX DAO, will calculate user balances on December 1st and distribute tokens sometime in December.</p>
<p>While Poloniex did not reveal further details yet, it noted that the airdrop tokens will come from &#8220;a premium project&#8221; soon to be listed on the exchange.</p>
<h2>Tron Transactions First to Be Re-Enabled</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The choice to re-enable Tron first is unsurprising given Poloniex&#8217;s close ties to Justin Sun. Poloniex is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, launched in 2014. It was acquired by Circle in 2018. The Tron founder assisted in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/justin-sun-reveals-investment-poloniex-090051054.html">acquiring Poloniex from Circle in 2019</a> and is an investor in the exchange.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are offering a 5% white hat bounty to the Poloniex hacker. Please return the funds to the following ETH/TRX/BTC wallets. We will give you 7 days to consider this offer before we engage law enforcement.<br />ETH Wallet: 0x176F3DAb24a159341c0509bB36B833E7fdd0a132 TRX:…</p>
<p>&mdash; H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1722951876986204259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Sun&#8217;s crypto ventures have suffered four hacks in the past two months totaling close to $240 million in losses, including both Poloniex and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">HTX seeing funds drained by hackers</a>. Despite the repeated hits, Sun has provided assurances that impacted user funds will be reimbursed across the affected platforms.</p>
<p>The Poloniex hack impacted the crypto industry at large, with the stolen funds causing price impacts on several assets. For example, <a href="https://watcher.guru/news/tron-founder-justin-suns-poloniex-hacked-for-over-100-million">$20 million worth of Tron was purchased by the hacker</a>, temporarily pumping TRX prices over 25%.</p>
<h2>Hacks Still a Threat for Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite security improvements, hacks are a constant threat to cryptocurrency exchanges. <a href="https://themoneymongers.com/crypto/biggest-crypto-heists-thefts/">A recent report from The Money Mongers</a> revealed the total number of cryptocurrency hacks in 2023 has already reached 330. These breaches have resulted in losses of $2.1 billion so far this year, equaling approximately $269,000 lost per hour to crypto hacking incidents.</p>
<p>Technical vulnerabilities and lax security practices make exchanges prime targets for cybercriminals. Many urge <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-responsibility-and-crypto-due-diligence-8385090">exchanges to adopt more robust security frameworks</a> and internal controls to protect user funds.</p>

<p>Last week brought several major developments on the crypto regulation front. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the U.S. and now faces up to 10 years in prison. Meanwhile, Grayscale submitted an updated prospectus for converting its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF, fueling hopes that approval may be close. Overseas, Singapore announced tighter regulations to protect crypto consumers, including banning crypto ads and incentives. Finally, ECB President Christine Lagarde revealed her son lost most of his crypto investments, reinforcing her skeptical stance.</p>
<p>In this column, we will analyze these key events from the past week and what they mean for the future of crypto oversight worldwide. The plea deal, persistent ETF application, bans on retail marketing, and high-profile crypto losses all signal intensifying global regulation. But many questions are present on how far restrictions will reach and what lies ahead for crypto businesses and investors.</p>
<h2>CZ Pleads Guilty, Faces Up to 10 Years in Prison</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of Binance, rocked the crypto world last week when he <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">pled guilty to criminal charges</a> related to money laundering and sanctions violations. The plea deal requires Binance to cease operations in the U.S., while Zhao himself may face up to a decade behind bars.</p>
<p>Zhao admitted that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution#:~:text=Binance's%20founder%20and%20chief%20executive,resigned%20as%20CEO%20of%20Binance.">Binance failed to maintain proper anti-money laundering safeguards</a>. This enabled illicit funds to flow undetected across the platform.</p>
<p>Prosecutors highlighted how Binance marketed heavily to U.S. customers <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2023-11-21/FinCEN_Consent_Order_2023-04_FINAL508.pdf">despite concealing its corporate structure</a> and lacking proper state licenses. The exchange also facilitated &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; of crypto transactions for its US customers, without implementing so-called &#8220;know your customer&#8221; checks. For these transgressions, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-cryptocurrency-money-laundering/#:~:text=Zhao%2C%20who%20stepped%20down%20from,to%20bar%20Zhao%20from%20leaving.">Zhao could serve up to 10 years in prison</a> when sentenced in February 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d10af983-1376-457f-9709-815e04ba59fb">U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asserted</a> that &#8220;using new technology to break the law does not make you a disrupter, it makes you a criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong drew contrasts between Binance&#8217;s lawlessness and his exchange&#8217;s embrace of regulation from day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1727054176763756826">Armstrong posted on X</a> that the Binance ruling &#8220;reinforces that doing it the hard way was the right decision,&#8221; suggesting properly licensed exchanges may gain market share. With its plea deal, Binance has vowed to revamp its compliance program. But the damage to its reputation may linger, especially if its founder receives substantial prison time next month.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time. We got the licenses, hired the compliance and legal teams, and made it clear our brand was about trust…</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Armstrong <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="🛡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1727054176763756826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On the other hand, House Majority Whip Rep. <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1727326527186993440">Tom Emmer touted CZ&#8217;s punishment as evidence</a> that new crypto laws are not needed, taking an opposite stance to lawmakers and advocates who believe new crypto rules are still required.</p>
<p>Emmer said existing laws can successfully prosecute bad actors like CZ. He believes Congress should focus on attracting crypto businesses rather than passing new legislation.</p>
<p>Emmer stated congressional resources should be spent bringing crypto activity onshore to aid national security.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Persists with Bitcoin ETF Prospectus</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While crypto companies grapple with increasing oversight, investor demand for SEC-approved investment products continues unabated. Last week, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-updates-bitcoin-etf-prospectus-after-discussing-with-sec.htm">Grayscale submitted an updated prospectus</a> for converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Grayscale has been pursuing approval since 2021, facing repeated rejections from the SEC. But the asset manager seems undeterred, encouraged by growing public and political support for a Bitcoin ETF.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.grayscale.com/blog/legal-topics/qa-our-lawsuit-against-the-sec">After suing the SEC in June 2022</a>, Grayscale secured a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/29/23850498/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-lawsuit-wins-sec">court order requiring the agency to review its application</a> last month. The revised filing specifically addresses SEC feedback.</p>
<p>Among the changes are a proposed ticker switch to BTC and shortened sections on cash creation policies. But no major revisions mean Grayscale believes it already meets regulatory standards.</p>
<p>If approved, analysts predict <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/24/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-could-see-27b-of-outflows-if-etf-conversion-is-approved-jpmorgan/">Grayscale could instantly become the largest bitcoin ETF</a>, commanding $50 billion in assets. Its conversion could finally open the gates for other issuers like Fidelity and BlackRock waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Of course, the SEC could simply delay its decision further. Continued engagement with Grayscale suggests a change in posture, however. With Bitcoin firmly entrenched in finance, regulators appear to be running out of reasons to deny investors ETF access.</p>
<p>By persisting through years of rejection, Grayscale seeks to become the first issuer to break through the ETF barrier. Its conversion would spur the next evolution in regulated crypto investing.</p>
<h2>Singapore Announces Stricter Crypto Regulations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Singapore is the latest nation to tighten its regulatory grip on the crypto sector. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-proposes-rules-to-tighten-crypto-speculation-in-retail-markets-heres-the-latest.htm">Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) unveiled new measures</a> last week to protect retail consumers from crypto risks.</p>
<p>While Singapore nurtures crypto innovation, its regulations have always focused on safeguarding individuals. In 2022 <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2022/mas-issues-guidelines-to-discourage-cryptocurrency-trading-by-general-public">MAS barred firms from marketing to the public</a> or offering improper incentives. <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-strengthens-regulatory-measures-for-digital-payment-token-services">Last week&#8217;s expansion prohibits additional practices</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepting credit card payments for crypto purchases</li>
<li>Providing crypto borrowing or lending services</li>
<li>Margin/leverage-based crypto trading</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAS today published business conduct and consumer access measures for Digital Payment Token services in Singapore to limit potential consumer harm. They will be implemented through regulations and guidelines, which will take effect in phases from mid-2024. <a href="https://t.co/laevvAlW0a">https://t.co/laevvAlW0a</a> <a href="https://t.co/kxBLRQG0az">pic.twitter.com/kxBLRQG0az</a></p>
<p>&mdash; MAS (@MAS_sg) <a href="https://twitter.com/MAS_sg/status/1727621867224404006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>These bans on crypto financing options directly address core consumer risks like excess leverage and spiraling debt. MAS also mandated more transparent listing criteria and complaint procedures.</p>
<p>The regulator continues warning that crypto is highly speculative despite added rules, however.</p>
<p>“DPT service providers have the obligation to safeguard the interests of consumers who interact with their platforms and use their services,” MAS managing director Ho Hern Shin stressed.</p>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s approach shows that even crypto-friendly jurisdictions realize <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2023/English/wpiea2023214-print-pdf.ashx">the sector&#8217;s volatility</a> necessitates some paternalistic interventions.</p>
<p>With comprehensive restrictions now in place, Singapore may inspire other Asian regulators concerned about unchecked crypto trading.</p>
<h2>ECB&#8217;s Lagarde Reveals Son&#8217;s Crypto Losses, Calls for Heightened Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto skepticism displayed by global financial leaders often stems from first-hand experience. Last week, European Central Bank (ECB) President <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-says-her-son-lost-almost-all-money-he-invested-in-crypto.htm">Christine Lagarde revealed her son suffered major losses</a> from his own crypto investments.</p>
<p>Lagarde has frequently warned about the volatility and risk posed by cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ecb-chief-lagarde-admits-her-son-lost-crypto-cash-2023-11-24/">Speaking at a student event in Frankfurt</a>, she disclosed that one of her sons invested in crypto against her advice and ended up losing 60% of his money when prices declined.</p>
<p>This personal episode only seems to reinforce Lagarde&#8217;s highly critical view of the crypto marketplace.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Christine Lagarde&#39;s son looses money in crypto. This is one of the reasons why Lagarde is against crypto currency.</p>
<p>Dear Christine Lagarde&#39;s son, for the future of crypto currency in Europe, please stop loosing money! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lagarde?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Lagarde</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Europe?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Europe</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoCommunity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoCommunity</a></p>
<p>&mdash; AG Crypto House<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3e0.png" alt="🏠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@AGCryptoHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGCryptoHouse/status/1729168544770802055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;I have, as you can tell, a very low opinion of cryptos,&#8221; Lagarde said. &#8220;People are free to invest their money where they want, people are free to speculate as much as they want, [but] people should not be free to participate in criminally sanctioned trade and businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under Lagarde&#8217;s leadership, the ECB has been a <a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/speeches/date/2023/html/ssm.sp231114~fd1b2cc234.en.html">vocal advocate for establishing comprehensive global regulations</a> on crypto assets. The bank is concerned about <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220425~6436006db0.en.html">crypto&#8217;s potential to enable criminal activities</a> and displace government-backed currencies.</p>
<p>The ECB is also piloting the development of a digital euro, hoping to provide a centralized digital payment alternative to decentralized cryptos. Lagarde said in September that a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-chief-lagarde-says-digital-euro-not-yet-out-there-would-take-two-years.htm#:~:text=%40sujha%2Dsundararajan-,ECB%20Chief%20Lagarde%20Says%20Digital%20Euro%20is%20%E2%80%9CNot%20Yet%20Out,and%20Would%20Take%20Two%20Years&amp;text=European%20Central%20Bank's%20(ECB)%20president,before%20it's%20the%20final%20say.%E2%80%9D">digital euro pilot will take at least two more years</a> before any potential rollout.</p>
<p>Lagarde&#8217;s personal story shows how first-hand experiences can shape policymakers&#8217; perspectives, even at the highest levels. As more officials or their families get burned by crypto market swings, calls for greater oversight may amplify across global finance.</p>
<h2>Balancing Crypto&#8217;s Potential and Perils</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last week brought several telling examples of the rapid maturation underway in crypto regulation worldwide. From criminal charges to protective bans to personal warnings, regulators demonstrated their resolve to mitigate perceived risks. The ultimate goal should be measured oversight that steers crypto&#8217;s evolution without stifling it, however.</p>
<p>Reasonable rules that check excesses and prevent fraud are key for the crypto regulation ecosystem to keep pace with technological change. A balanced approach recognizes cryptos&#8217; potential alongside their perils.</p>
<p>With so many diverse interests at stake, disputes over regulation will persist. Still, recent events reaffirm that oversight is an imperative, not an option. Collaboration between lawmakers and crypto firms will shape the optimal path forward.</p>
<p>Last week offered milestones, but not an endpoint. The future of crypto regulation promises continued progress through principled trial and error.</p>

<p>The 7% <strong>TIA price</strong> surge so far today has positioned <strong>Celestia</strong> as one of the <strong>best crypto to buy now</strong>, while <strong>Uniswap</strong> and <strong>Toncoin</strong> have also caught the market&#8217;s attention with their strong performance.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>crypto presales</strong> such as <strong>Bitcoin ETF Token</strong> and <strong>Meme Kombat</strong> are introducing fresh Bitcoin alternatives to the market.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After hitting its all-time high of $7.42 on November 16, TIA has pulled back to find support at around the Fib 0.382 level of $5.45.</p>
<p>Since bouncing from this support, TIA has been consolidating between $5.50 and $5.90 over the past week.</p>
<p>With TIA up 7% so far today as it attempts to retake the Fib 0.236 level of $6.21, it appears TIA is done taking a breather and is set on resuming its uptrend.</p>
<p>UNI has also seen a noteworthy rally in November, with its price closing near 26% on November 22.</p>
<p>Price forecasts suggest TIA could reach $6.5 by the end of November, with the token exhibiting strength in the last few days of the month as it consolidates above $6.</p>
<p>Uniswap’s long-term trend line suggests bullish sentiments, with a potential positive long-term movement.</p>
<p>Recent developments include a proposal by the Uniswap DAO to increase voting power for underrepresented delegates.</p>
<p>The peak performance of Toncoin in November witnessed its price soaring to a new <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/ytd.asp">year-to-date (YTD)</a> high of $2.770.</p>
<p>This peak represented a significant turnaround for the cryptocurrency in 2023, following a loss of over 55% in the first two quarters of the year.</p>
<p>TON is currently consolidating above its FiB 0.786 level of $2.387, trading 0.33% higher at $2.456.</p>
<p>This consistent upward trend has resulted in an overall increase of over 5% during the previous week.</p>
<p>Amid the established tokens, crypto presales offer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">fresh Bitcoin alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>They are in their early stages but are drawing attention to their potential in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and Meme Kombat are two such projects that have gained notice as some of the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<p>Building on our discussion of why TIA, UNI, TON, BTCETF, and MK are the best crypto to buy now, let&#8217;s analyze their technical and fundamental characteristics.</p>
<h2>Bulls Take Charge as TIA Price Eyes Further Gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_137378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137378" style="width: 1815px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137378" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the tia price" width="1815" height="849" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart.png 1815w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart-1024x479.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart-768x359.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701209171-11-28-23-cn-tia-chart-1536x718.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1815px) 100vw, 1815px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137378" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TIAUSDT/">TIAUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After a week of range-bound price action, Celestia (TIA) is attempting a breakout with the TIA price surging 7.02% so far today to $6.2939.</p>
<p>With technical indicators turning bullish, TIA may be gearing up for further gains in the sessions ahead.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the TIA price currently stands at $5.0356, crossing above the 50-day EMA, typically a bullish sign.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the RSI has climbed to 63.06, up from yesterday&#8217;s 60.48, showing growing momentum.</p>
<p>As the TIA price pushes higher, it faces initial resistance at the Fib 0.236 level of $6.2092.</p>
<p>Beyond that, TIA must contend with the current swing high resistance between $7.1401 and $7.4293.</p>
<p>Overcoming these levels could open the door for TIA to retest its all-time high of $8.19.</p>
<p>On the downside, support lies at the Fib 0.382 level of $5.4548, aligning with the horizontal support zone spanning $5.1260 to $5.4565.</p>
<p>As long as TIA holds above this area, the uptrend remains intact.</p>
<p>However, a break below $5.45 could lead to a steeper pullback towards the 20-day EMA around $5.03.</p>
<p>TIA previously found support here earlier this month, so the bulls will want to defend this level.</p>
<p>With buying momentum resurging as seen by the rising RSI, TIA looks set to take out overhead resistance.</p>
<p>Still, trading within defined risk limits is prudent while awaiting confirmation of the breakout.</p>
<p>A decisive move past $6.20 or below $5.45 will likely set the next major trend for the TIA price.</p>
<h2>Support Holds, Momentum Fades: Uniswap&#8217;s UNI Navigates Consolidation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_137379" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137379" style="width: 1812px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137379" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the uni price" width="1812" height="850" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart.png 1812w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart-1024x480.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart-768x360.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210172-11-28-23-cn-uni-chart-1536x721.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1812px) 100vw, 1812px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137379" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/UNIUSDT/">UNIUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After surging to a new multi-month high, Uniswap (UNI) has pulled back over the past week, with the UNI price shedding 2.19% so far today to trade around $6.156.</p>
<p>While still holding above key support, waning momentum suggests further consolidation may lie ahead for UNI in the near term.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the UNI price stands at $5.603, above the 50-day EMA of $5.100, reflecting the recent uptrend.</p>
<p>However, the distance between the short and long-term EMAs has narrowed, pointing to decelerating upside momentum.</p>
<p>The RSI has also cooled off, dropping to 65.33 from yesterday’s 69.08, though still in bullish territory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the MACD histogram has tapered to 0.063, down from 0.081 previously.</p>
<p>This indicates slowing bullish sentiment that could limit gains for the UNI price.</p>
<p>On the upside, UNI faces immediate resistance at the horizontal zone between $6.326 and $6.499, which has capped gains over the past week.</p>
<p>A decisive break above this area is needed to resume the uptrend towards the psychological $7.00 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, the first layer of support lies at the Fib 0.786 level of $6.084.</p>
<p>This level aligns with the 20-day EMA near $5.60, making it a key battleground for bulls and bears.</p>
<p>Losing this area could trigger a drop back towards the 50-day EMA around $5.10.</p>
<p>UNI will need to hold above this longer-term moving average to maintain its bullish posturing.</p>
<p>While UNI remains in an uptrend, indicators suggest bullish momentum is stalling.</p>
<p>Traders may consider tightening stops and lowering position sizes until a clearer direction emerges.</p>
<p>Move outside of $6.50 resistance or below $6.00 support will likely set the trend.</p>
<h2>TONcoin (TON) Price Holds Strong Above Key Support Levels</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_137380" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137380" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137380" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the ton chart " width="1814" height="851" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart.png 1814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart-1024x480.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart-768x360.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701210666-11-28-23-cn-ton-chart-1536x721.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137380" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView / TONUSDT</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Toncoin (TON) price continues to hold above crucial support levels, trading at $2.456 with a gain of 0.33% so far today.</p>
<p>With the 20-day EMA at $2.371 and the 50-day EMA at $3.264, the short-term moving average remains above the long-term moving average, typically a bullish signal.</p>
<p>However, with the two EMAs converging, volatility and uncertainty surround the TON price and investors should proceed cautiously relying solely on this indicator.</p>
<p>The RSI currently stands at 57.74, up slightly from 57.29 yesterday. This shows momentum strengthening in the TON price and that it is moving away from oversold territory below 30.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram sits at -0.001, improving from -0.004 the previous day. This indicates the negative momentum is slowing and a potential bullish MACD crossover could emerge.</p>
<p>TON currently faces resistance between $2.576 and $2.6. Overcoming this could propel prices higher.</p>
<p>Support lies between $2.334 and $2.387, aligned with the 20-day EMA and fib 0.786 level. This support needs to hold to avoid a steep drop.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Alternatives Flying Under the Radar</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As Bitcoin continues leading the market, many savvy crypto investors are looking beyond the flagship currency to lesser-known alternatives that have yet to capture the spotlight.</p>
<p>Though still high risk, participating in early-stage presales of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">promising new cryptocurrencies</a> allows investors to acquire tokens at cheaper prices compared to their potential future value.</p>
<p>The key is identifying promising projects on the verge of solving real-world problems or meeting unsatisfied market demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat</a> are two such cryptocurrencies offering presale opportunities.</p>
<p>Their offerings give investors a chance to get in early on what could become major players down the line, at a fraction of their possible future price.</p>
<p>For crypto investors searching for Bitcoin alternatives, these presales may warrant consideration before their official launch.</p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin ETF Token: A Leading Contender for Best Crypto to Buy Now</strong></h3>
<p>While many alternatives to Bitcoin exist, Bitcoin ETF Token stands out for its robust tokenomics model and potential to capitalize on the momentum surrounding the much-anticipated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-to-decide-on-two-spot-bitcoin-etfs-by-nov-17.htm">SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>
<p>The project incorporates three key components primed to drive substantial gains.</p>
<p>First is a 25% token burn allocated across five Bitcoin ETF milestones, creating scarcity as excitement peaks.</p>
<p>The deflationary pressure is compounded by a 5% transaction burn, rewarding long-term holding.</p>
<p>Next, <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/en/dashboard">staking enables holders to earn 129% APY</a> in passive income. Yields will decrease as the staking pool grows, however, making early participation vital.</p>
<p>Finally, Bitcoin ETF Token offers a news dashboard compiling the latest Bitcoin developments and events.</p>
<p>This unique utility seeks to cultivate an active, engaged community around the project.</p>

<h3><strong>Can Pre-Launch Meme Kombat Become the Best Crypto to Buy Now?</strong></h3>
<p>While play-to-earn (P2E) models have struggled to gain traction in traditional gaming, they have found <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/gaming-in-the-crypto-age-play-to-earn-versus-play-and-earn">fertile ground in crypto by integrating digital assets</a>.</p>
<p>One leader of this approach is Axie Infinity, which features battles between NFT monsters that players can earn income from.</p>
<p>Now a new project called Meme Kombat seeks to bring a similar model to the meme coin industry, while still in the presale stage.</p>
<p>With $2.2 million raised so far, its native MK token currently sells for $0.214 in the presale, increasing in price at each stage.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat will feature fights between popular meme coin mascots, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Players will be able to bet MK tokens on match outcomes, with results recorded on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/blockchain/">blockchain</a> for transparency.</p>
<p><iframe title="&#x1f680;&#x1f525; Exclusive: Meme Kombat Smashes Records, Raises $2 Million! Full Review! &#x1f4a5;&#x1f3ae;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67v_wXP5iYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>An AI will manage battles and payouts based on gaming mechanics and fighter attributes.</p>
<p>The gameplay involves staking MK tokens and using a portion to bet in PvP or PvG modes.</p>
<p>PvP allows betting against other players while PvG involves probability-based bets against the house.</p>
<p>Players will be able to formulate strategies to predict fight outcomes.</p>
<p>Meme Kombat&#8217;s tokenomics involve a total supply of 120 million MK, with 50% for presale, 30% for staking/betting rewards, and a 20% split for liquidity and community rewards.</p>
<p>The project roadmap follows a seasonal model common in modern gaming.</p>
<p>The team plans to retain veteran players while attracting new ones with regular gameplay updates.</p>
<p>For those drawn to pre-launch potential, Meme Kombat could be one of the best crypto to buy now among current presale alternatives.</p>
