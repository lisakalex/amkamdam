<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen its fair share of hype cycles and &#8216;next big things&#8217;. Seasoned crypto traders know how to spot truly promising projects with long-term upside early. Lately, chatter has grown around one new token conducting a presale offering substantial bonuses that position early backers for potential gains. While the project is unknown to the broader public, those in the know have quietly accumulated sizable token holdings ahead of upcoming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">exchange listings</a>.</p>
<p>This growing chatter stems from Launchpad XYZ, a new crypto trading platform that has attracted $2.1 million so far in its presale of LPX tokens.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/en"><strong><u>Visit Launchpad XYZ Now</u></strong></a></p>
<h2>Presale Bonuses for LPX Buyers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A key feature of the LPX presale is a bonus structure where presale participants receive a bonus percentage in tokens on top of their purchase. This bonus decreases by 1% every seven days, currently standing at 6% and incentivizing buyers to get in early.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ also introduced a five-tier NFT pass system with escalating benefits based on the investment amount. The tiers range from ‘Doge’ at $50 for basic access to ‘Elon’ at $25,000+ with additional perks. Each tier unlocks increasing access to Launchpad XYZ’s trading resources and community.</p>
<h2>AI-Powered Personalized Crypto Trading</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Launchpad XYZ seeks to differentiate itself through AI-powered crypto trading tools. The tools include Apollo for generating customized trading strategies, and Launchpad Quotient (LPQ) for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-becomes-5th-most-traded-crypto-in-the-world-adoption-rising.htm">price prediction</a> using AI and over 400 data points. The platform is also developing a high-liquidity terminal and educational content.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>During the crypto presale, Launchpad XYZ opened an <a href="https://t.co/ZUZaIKgy84">alpha Telegram signals group</a> with remarkable reported returns, demonstrating potential profits for users. Figures show more than 20 trades with over 100% returns, eight trades exceeding 1000%, and one trade hitting 7000%.</p>
<h2>Broadening Accessibility with Gaming, DEX, and Metaverse</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Beyond its AI trading tools, Launchpad XYZ has plans to become a diverse crypto ecosystem. Upcoming products include a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-to-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn gaming hub</a>, a decentralized exchange (DEX), and a metaverse library. The roadmap paints the picture of a comprehensive platform for all things Web3.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ also wants to advance the mass adoption of crypto and blockchain technology. Its services seek to provide accessible on-ramps to digital finance and simplify traditionally complex processes like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2023/11/29/impact-investing-strategies-to-accelerate-positive-change/">trading strategy</a> development. Given crypto&#8217;s steep learning curve, this focus on usability could attract many new participants.</p>
<p>If successful, Launchpad XYZ could play a meaningful role in driving cryptocurrency and blockchain into the mainstream. For now, the presale continues as crypto traders stack up LPX tokens in anticipation of exchange listings and potentially substantial returns.</p>

<p>A pillar of Ethereum&#8217;s original vision was decentralization—the idea that its blockchain would operate outside constraints from centralized entities like governments and corporations. Recent data indicates this ideology is being tested, however, as key Ethereum players increasingly censor transactions linked to US sanctions.</p>
<h2>The Turn Toward Censorship</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A major turning point came last year when the US Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/federal-court-supports-sanctions-tornado-cash-crypto-mixer-despite-user-protest.htm">(OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash</a>, an Ethereum mixing service that enabled private transactions. OFAC claimed the tool was utilized by terrorists and other illicit actors.</p>
<p>In response, Tornado Cash&#8217;s code was added to the same <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">US blacklist containing bad actors like North Korea and Hamas</a>. Supporters <a href="https://forum.dfinity.org/t/tornado-cash-is-banned-how-will-it-affect-spinner-cash/14768">decried the targeting</a> of Tornado Cash as government overreach and censorship. Ethereum has not proven immune, however.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139877" style="width: 936px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-139877 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701885922-28794291fcb0bd5648fca0522b86e387.png" alt="Ethereum censorship" width="936" height="547" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701885922-28794291fcb0bd5648fca0522b86e387.png 936w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701885922-28794291fcb0bd5648fca0522b86e387-300x175.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701885922-28794291fcb0bd5648fca0522b86e387-768x449.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701885922-28794291fcb0bd5648fca0522b86e387-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139877" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Ethereum Censorship Dashboard by <a href="https://twitter.com/nero_eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toni Wahrstätter.</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In recent months, censorship of transactions tied to US sanctions has markedly increased on Ethereum, according to <a href="https://censorship.pics/">new research<u></u> from Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter</a>. A metric measuring “censored” blocks on Ethereum surged from around 25% in November 2022 to approximately 72% currently.</p>
<p>This spike stems largely from block builders, who assemble transactions into blocks and <a href="https://mevboost.pics/">provide them to validators</a> to add to Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain. Five major block builders now contribute over 90% of Ethereum blocks. Of those, only one major builder, <a href="https://www.titanbuilder.xyz/">Titan Builder</a>, claims it does not filter transactions in this manner.</p>
<p>The lone block builder still processing all transactions claims over 20% of blocks. If Titan began engaging in censorship as well, per Wahrstätter&#8217;s analysis, overall Ethereum censorship could immediately jump to over 90%. Such reliance on a few builders contradicts the decentralized ethos blockchain promised.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139878" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139878" style="width: 942px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-139878 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701886115-b795a3b0f04fdf923baa7fe7768c60bc.png" alt="Ethereum decentralized" width="942" height="506" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701886115-b795a3b0f04fdf923baa7fe7768c60bc.png 942w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701886115-b795a3b0f04fdf923baa7fe7768c60bc-300x161.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701886115-b795a3b0f04fdf923baa7fe7768c60bc-768x413.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701886115-b795a3b0f04fdf923baa7fe7768c60bc-150x81.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139878" class="wp-caption-text">MEV-Boost Dashboard by Toni Wahrstätter</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Impacts on Ethereum&#8217;s Core Values</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For many in the Ethereum community, such censorship represents a betrayal of the network&#8217;s founding principles. The technology&#8217;s decentralized appeal rests on it being uncontrolled and unfettered by real-world biases. Yet block builders now hold immense power over which transactions end up on Ethereum, granting them the power to selectively exclude addresses flagged by OFAC.</p>
<p>Some builders defend this censorship as merely <a href="https://twitter.com/Zach_Glass/status/1557397894210232322">prudent compliance with US regulations</a>. However, critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent of centralized entities overriding Ethereum&#8217;s core coding to meet external rules. It also limits full access to the blockchain for individuals sanctioned by the US government.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">F2Pool was filtering (censoring) OFAC Bitcoin transactions recently and everyone got mad and then they stopped almost immediately. </p>
<p>Can Ethereum do the same with censoring builders? As in, just ask that they stop. Like is this a corollary would you say or no? <a href="https://t.co/6NUBmoEWuF">pic.twitter.com/6NUBmoEWuF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Gwart (@GwartyGwart) <a href="https://twitter.com/GwartyGwart/status/1729947832193364276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h2>Centralization Creeping In</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Beyond censorship, the centralization of key transaction functions into a few dominant <a href="https://protos.com/ethereum-centralization-is-becoming-a-serious-problem/">block builders could pose security risks</a>, according to experts. Further, these players gain privileged access to pending transaction data, potentially allowing them to maximize profits through trading strategies before transactions are added to the blockchain. This raises additional questions about fairness and transparency.</p>
<p>Ethereum was designed as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decentralized-social-network-friendtech-surpasses-1-million-in-24-hour-fees-leaving-uniswap-and-bitcoin-behind.htm">decentralized network</a> not beholden to external constraints. Block builders processing transactions increasingly censor addresses tied to US sanctions, however, calling Ethereum&#8217;s decentralization into question. While some view this censorship as prudent legal compliance, critics see it as contradicting Ethereum&#8217;s core values.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, Ethereum&#8217;s leadership is exploring ways to curb censorship trends. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/09/vitalik-buterins-new-ethereum-roadmap-takes-aim-at-mev-and-censorship/">Vitalik Buterin has proposed updates</a> that inhibit transaction blocking by validators and builders.</p>
<p>This challenge to Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized ethos may prove to be a defining one, forcing the community to confront difficult questions about the limits and future direction of the technology. The answers could shape Ethereum&#8217;s ability to evolve while retaining the core principles on which it was founded.</p>

Helium is seeing a substantial intraday gain so far, enabling the cryptocurrency to retest the key $5 level earlier today when it reached a high of $5.014.</p>
<p>At present, Helium is trading at $4.269, up 42.02% so far today. This rise contributes to a 30-day gain of 130%. Helium&#8217;s trading volume also spiked to $36.6 million, showing a rise of 1,188%.</p>

<p>This price rally coincides with Helium&#8217;s launch of Helium Mobile, a new nationwide phone plan costing $20 per month for unlimited data, texting, and calls. This rate undercuts typical U.S. cell phone bills.</p>
<p>Helium Mobile combines Helium&#8217;s decentralized, crowd-sourced network with the nation&#8217;s largest 5G carrier.</p>
<p>Helium states this fusion aims to provide reliable nationwide coverage and ensure user data privacy, unlike some traditional cell plans.</p>
<p>Helium promises subscriber data will not be sold to third parties. Subscribers who help map Helium&#8217;s network coverage can earn rewards to cover their monthly bill.</p>
<p>Helium has also introduced two new Helium Mobile Hotspots, priced at $499 for an outdoor version and $249 for indoor.</p>
<p>These hotspots allow consumers to operate personal cell towers to boost coverage and reduce dead zones, expanding Helium&#8217;s reach.</p>
<p>Celestia&#8217;s TIA token also impresses with substantial gains, surging over 66% in the past week.</p>
<p>TIA presently trades at $10.7126, up 5.58% so far today after hitting a new all-time high of $11.50 earlier today.</p>
<p>This performance could signal further interest in Celestia&#8217;s capabilities and potential for expansion.</p>
<p>Avalanche&#8217;s native token, AVAX, is also shaping up to be a top performer among large-cap cryptocurrencies with a 120% increase over the past month.</p>

<p>The HNT price has recently seen a remarkable climb, with a rise of 41.02% in just one day, and is currently trading at $4.269.</p>
<p>This surge accompanies the recent release of the platform&#8217;s Helium Mobile.</p>
<p>HNT&#8217;s 20-day EMA currently stands at $2.742, significantly below the current HNT price.</p>
<p>This is a bullish sign, indicating that the recent price increase is not a temporary spike but rather a potential new upward trend.</p>
<p>The 50-day and 100-day EMAs, standing at $2.258 and $1.969 respectively, also support this bullish outlook, being well below the current price.</p>
<p>Turning to the RSI, it has surged to 86.51 from yesterday&#8217;s 72.58.</p>
<p>Typically, an RSI above 70 signals that an asset is potentially overbought, suggesting that the HNT price may be due for a correction or consolidation in the short term.</p>
<p>However, extreme RSI values can also be an indication of strong momentum, which seems to be the case given the recent price action.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram, another momentum indicator, is currently at 0.095, lower than yesterday&#8217;s 0.20.</p>
<p>Although this marks a decrease, the MACD histogram remains in positive territory, indicating that the bullish sentiment still holds some strength.</p>
<p>As for key price levels, the HNT price has already broken through its immediate horizontal resistance zone between $3.188 to $3.409.</p>
<p>The price is now dealing with resistance in the $4.234 to $4.435 range.</p>
<p>If the HNT price manages to close above this level, it could turn the former resistance into potential support, providing a foundation for further upward movement.</p>
<p>On the downside, the immediate support is at the 20-day EMA of $2.742. Should the HNT price pull back, this level could provide a bounce point.</p>
<p>However, with the price well above this level and the recent momentum, it appears less likely that this level will be tested in the immediate future.</p>
<p>While the technical indicators suggest that the HNT price has entered the overbought territory, the strong momentum may carry the price further upward in the short term.</p>
<p>Investors should be cautious, however, as a pullback or consolidation phase could follow this sharp rise.</p>
<h2>Celestia (TIA) Price Discovery Phase Continues with No Signs of Slowdown</h2>

<p>The TIA price has been on a strong upward trajectory, extending its gains for a potential third consecutive day and hitting an all-time high of $11.5000 earlier today, indicating a robust bullish sentiment among investors.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is currently in a price discovery phase, with no immediate signs of a slowdown.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the TIA price currently stands at $7.0496, considerably below the present price level. Typically, when the price trades significantly above the EMA, it may be indicative of overbought conditions.</p>
<p>In this case, however, the TIA price has maintained its position above the EMA, sustaining its bullish momentum.</p>
<p>TIA&#8217;s RSI currently reads at 79.12, up from yesterday&#8217;s 77.49. An RSI above 70 typically signals overbought conditions, suggesting that the TIA price might be ripe for a pullback.</p>
<p>However, the continued uptrend could indicate the presence of strong buying pressure, which might delay any potential reversal.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram registers at 0.3168, an increase from yesterday&#8217;s 0.2587. This rise in the MACD histogram suggests that the bullish momentum is still growing, potentially propelling further upward movement in the TIA price.</p>
<p>On the upside, the TIA price faces resistance at its current all-time high of $11.5000. Beyond this, the next significant resistance lies at the extended Fib -0.236 level of $12.9977, which notably aligns with the psychological level of $13. Breaking these resistance levels could see the TIA price soar further to new highs.</p>
<p>Conversely, immediate support for the TIA price is found at the Fib 0.236 level of $9.9895. This level could serve as a potential bounce point should the price initiate a pullback.</p>
<p>As the TIA price continues its ascent, investors should approach with caution. The overbought conditions indicated by the RSI may hint at a potential pullback, but strong buying pressure and increasing bullish momentum as shown by the rising MACD may delay such a reversal.</p>
<p>Investors should closely monitor the aforementioned resistance and support levels. A breakout past the $13 resistance could indicate a continuation of the bullish trend, while a pullback to the $9.9895 support could trigger a potential price correction.</p>
<p>While the TIA price is currently demonstrating strong bullish momentum, market participants should stay vigilant and watch for any signs of a potential reversal or continuation of the current trend.</p>

<p>The AVAX price continues to impress with its ongoing uptrend, currently trading at $26.93, an increase of 9.74% so far today.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has risen by over 117% the past month, attempting to break out from its immediate resistance levels.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the AVAX price is currently at $21.39, well below the current price. This indicates a strong upward momentum in the AVAX price, as it is significantly trading above the short-term EMA.</p>
<p>The 50-day EMA and 100-day EMA stand at $17.78 and $15.19 respectively, further corroborating the bullish trend.</p>
<p>However, such a substantial deviation from the EMAs could also suggest the price is now hovering in overbought territory.</p>
<p>The RSI for the AVAX price reads at 78.39, up from yesterday&#8217;s 73.25, suggesting that the asset is potentially overbought. Typically, an RSI above 70 signals overbought conditions, hinting at a potential pullback.</p>
<p>However, the AVAX price is still climbing, indicating strong buying pressure that can delay any potential reversal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the MACD histogram has turned positive, recording at 0.17 from yesterday&#8217;s -0.04. This newly formed bullish MACD crossover indicates that buying pressure is increasing, which could propel the AVAX price further.</p>
<p>On the upside, the immediate resistance for the AVAX price is the horizontal zone between $25.01 to $25.83. However, given the robust price action today, this level could potentially turn into a support level in the coming days.</p>
<p>The next level of significant resistance lies between $29.37 to $30.22, which coincides with the psychological level of $30. Overcoming these resistance levels could signal a continuation of the bullish trend.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support for the AVAX price lies between $21.36 to $22.82, which aligns with the 20-day EMA of $21.39. This level could serve as a potential bounce point if the AVAX price initiates a pullback.</p>
<p>Despite the AVAX price&#8217;s ongoing ascent, investors should approach with caution. The overbought conditions suggested by the RSI may hint at a potential pullback.</p>
<p>However, the strong buying pressure and a positive MACD crossover indicate that the bullish momentum may continue.</p>
<p>Investors should closely watch the resistance and support levels. A breakout past the $30 resistance could hint at a continuation of the bullish trend, while a pullback to the $21.36 support could trigger a potential price correction.</p>
<p>AVAX&#8217;s current bullish momentum necessitates vigilance from market participants. While signs point towards ongoing ascendance, caution is key as the market sentiment can rapidly change.</p>
<p>While names like AVAX, TIA and HNT surge, the next crypto winner could be quietly fundraising today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and Bitcoin Minetrix are two presales set to benefit from coming shifts in ETF and mining adoption.</p>
<h2><strong>The Search for Promising Bitcoin Alternatives</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance, investors are actively seeking out compelling Bitcoin alternatives yet to hit the mainstream.</p>
<p>Entering early into carefully researched new crypto ventures gives you a chance to gain a foothold for a fraction of their potential future worth.</p>

<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and Bitcoin Minetrix are two current fundraising Bitcoin alternatives that warrant a closer look.</p>
<p>These new blockchain concepts seek to shake up the traditional finance and bitcoin mining industries through their platform&#8217;s pioneering approaches.</p>
<p>Investing in the presales of these lesser-known cryptos presents a potential upside before wider market awareness sets in.</p>
<p>Rather than limiting investments to major cryptos like Bitcoin, these presales allow early entry into cutting-edge cryptocurrency projects and business models.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin will likely remain dominant, slipping some alternative cryptos into a portfolio provides diversification and speculative upside.</p>
<p>The next surge of wealth creation may come from an unassuming Bitcoin alternative quietly building behind the scenes today.</p>
<h3><strong>BTCETF: The Best Crypto to Buy Now as SEC Nears Bitcoin ETF Approval</strong></h3>
<p>Capitalizing on renewed optimism for Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC in 2024, crypto project Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) has commenced a presale fundraising round for its native token BTCETF.</p>
<p>BTCETF is an ERC-20 token built around the impending launch of the first regulated, SEC-sanctioned Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>It has already attracted over $2.5 million in presale purchases, with its token price increasing from an initial $0.005 to the current $0.0062 per BTCETF.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The presale comes amid building optimism that the SEC will finally approve Bitcoin ETF applications during a pivotal regulatory window between January 5-10, 2024.</p>
<p>Popular analyst channel <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1731751352622325795?s=20">Altcoin Daily recently explained</a> to its 1.4 million X followers how an approved Bitcoin ETF could mirror the gold ETF watershed moment in 2004. They noted gold prices never returned to pre-ETF levels afterward.</p>
<p>Altcoin Daily also highlighted how Bitcoin&#8217;s capped supply would intensify any demand spikes post-ETF approval compared to commodities like gold.</p>
<p>BTCETF seeks to benefit from the expected flood of capital into Bitcoin if SEC-approved ETFs launch.</p>
<p>It will burn 25% of its total token supply in five milestones based on the ETF approval process.</p>
<p>In addition to its deflationary design, BTCETF will also implement a transaction tax that starts at 5% and gradually declines to zero when certain milestones are achieved.</p>
<p>This tax system will further reduce the token&#8217;s circulating supply over time.</p>
<p>By tying its very tokenomics to the impending adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, BTCETF offers traders indirect exposure and upside to this macroeconomic shift.</p>

<p>These credits can then be redeemed for Bitcoin, allowing a hands-off way to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">gain exposure to Bitcoin mining rewards</a>.</p>
<p>The project represents a departure from conventional, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin-mining.htm">hardware-driven Bitcoin mining operations</a> requiring intensive use of resources.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix seeks to open up mining to more users through its tokenized approach.</p>
<p>According to the Bitcoin Minetrix website, the total presale supply is limited, which has created an urgency to buy tokens early.</p>
<p>The project has already raised over a third of its $15 million soft cap with the latest stage nearing completion.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin mining has faced criticism over sustainability concerns, Bitcoin Minetrix promotes a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/greenest-cryptocurrency.htm">greener solution</a> with its cloud-based setup requiring less energy.</p>
<p>With its stake-to-mine model, strong presale momentum, and greener approach to mining, Bitcoin Minetrix makes a compelling case as perhaps the best crypto to buy now while still early.</p>

<p>The latest major release of the Bitcoin Core software, version 26.0, is now available. The upgrade includes changes that will improve network connectivity and syncing speed for nodes. Bitcoin developers have indicated that the next release, v27, may put an end to the controversial Bitcoin Ordinals, however.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Core v26.0 Released With Improvements to Networking and Syncing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.0/">The v26.0 update</a> comes with several optimizations that improve networking connectivity and initial blockchain syncing speeds for nodes.</p>
<p>Key features in Bitcoin Core v26.0 include preliminary support for a new network data transport protocol, increased resilience against <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin#:~:text=Eclipse%20attacks%20are%20a%20special,affected%20node%20into%20wrongful%20action.">eclipse attacks</a>, faster node bootstrapping with UTXO snapshots, and a variety of RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) enhancements.</p>
<p>The new transport protocol referred to as v2 is opt-in for now but allows upgraded nodes to take advantage of better peer connectivity if both parties have v2 enabled. The default legacy protocol is still fully supported.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Core v26.0 also helps nodes stay connected to multiple networks simultaneously, preventing isolation and eclipse attacks where peers are unable to maintain diverse connections.</p>
<p>One of the biggest additions in this release is loadtxoutset RPC which can utilize <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/UTXO-types-in-each-Bitcoin-snapshot_tbl5_330417623">UTXO snapshots</a> to bootstrap a node in minutes instead of hours. This brings usable nodes online instantly rather than waiting for full sync.</p>
<p>Additionally, several RPCs have been added or updated including getchainstates to monitor sync progress and improved <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoins-major-upgrade-taproot-set-for-activation-this-week.htm">Taproot support</a> for certain wallet functions.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Ordinals Could Cease with Coming Bitcoin Core v27</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-token-tap-1-billion-market-cap-as-btc-moves-past-43500.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals</a> are satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) that have been digitally inscribed with text or an image to make them unique collectibles — essentially Bitcoin-based NFTs.</p>
<p>They were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/ordinals-creator-views-his-bitcoin-centric-creation-as-digital-artifacts-not-just-nfts/">introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor</a> but have become controversial due to aggregating large amounts of data on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is meant for financial transactions.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin Core v26.0 does not directly address the ongoing issues with Bitcoin Ordinals, developers have hinted that the next major release, v27, will include changes that disable critical functionality needed for new Ordinals to be created.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA: “Inscriptions” are exploiting a vulnerability in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> Core to spam the blockchain.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Luke Dashjr, Founder of OCEAN mining pool and Bitcoin Core contributor, explained that the method used for making Ordinals takes advantage of a vulnerability that was recently patched in the <a href="https://bitcoinknots.org/">Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Knots</a>.</p>
<p>Dashjr explained the vulnerability allowed Ordinals to bypass the code&#8217;s limits on extra data in transactions by obfuscating inscription data as program code.</p>
<p>Dashjr has been a vocal critic of Ordinals since their introduction, stating they are spamming the blockchain and causing damage to the network. The recent resurgence in Ordinal activity has congested the network and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/08/bitcoin-fees-soar-nearly-1000-since-august-as-ordinals-are-back-in-vogue/">driven up average transaction fees on Bitcoin</a> by more than 1000%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139859" style="width: 981px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-139859 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701880915-a15d36490f441c12c1061789387cd8b3.png" alt="Bitcoin Core v26, Bitcoin fees" width="981" height="262" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701880915-a15d36490f441c12c1061789387cd8b3.png 981w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701880915-a15d36490f441c12c1061789387cd8b3-300x80.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701880915-a15d36490f441c12c1061789387cd8b3-768x205.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701880915-a15d36490f441c12c1061789387cd8b3-150x40.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139859" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Average Transaction Fee is at a current level of 19.46, up from 10.99 yesterday and up from 1.337 one year ago. This is a change of 77.08% from yesterday and 1350% from one year ago. <em>Bitcoin Average Transaction Fee Chart by <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">YCharts</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pending update in Bitcoin Core v27 fixes this vulnerability, which would prevent new Ordinals from being minted. Existing Ordinals would remain on the blockchain, however.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rarity_garden/status/1732323569516818828">Other developers have defended the experiment</a> as an unintended, but interesting emergent phenomenon, while still acknowledging the technical issues.</p>
<p>Regardless, most experts agree that the Ordinal frenzy revealed the need for proactive measures to manage blockchain growth and congestion. Though <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/who-controls-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin is decentralized</a>, decisions like disabling Ordinals highlight the ability for coordinated updates to nudge the ecosystem in a certain direction.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Core project has a responsibility to maintain Bitcoin as sound money for the world. This requires balancing the stability and reliability of the network with openness to new ideas, even controversial ones. The v26 and v27 updates seek to strike that balance with minimal disruption to users of Bitcoin for payments, trading, and investment.</p>

<p>Yesterday, legendary American thrash metal band Megadeth announced the launch of a new non-fungible token (NFT) collection, offering fans exclusive access to digital and real-world experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Megadeth/status/1732059313504415762">The band unveiled the news via a post on X</a>, stating that the collection will consist of 5,000 NFTs featuring their mascot, Vic Rattlehead. Owning one of these NFTs will provide access to experiences like private conversations with band members in the metaverse. Megadeth also noted that they hope to foster a community owned by fans rather than a standard fan club with this initiative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Warm Reception From Megadeth&#8217;s Online Following</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the announcement, Megadeth has received an <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePhenomenalAV/status/1732059686273265904">outpouring of enthusiasm</a> from its substantial social media following. Many fans responded to the band&#8217;s post positively about the fusion of heavy metal and NFTs.</p>
<p>Other artists in the industry have also voiced support. M. Shadows, lead singer of Avenged Sevenfold, congratulated Megadeth on the launch.</p>
<p><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">&#8220;Congrats to </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1loqt21" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/MegadethDigital">@MegadethDigital</a> </span>Every project should be judged on the merit of what they provide and not the underpinning technology,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/shadows_eth/status/1732080721337196613">he tweeted</a>. &#8220;Blockchain simply gives you more options and ownership. Hope to see more artists take the leap with their communities.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Megadeth&#8217;s NFT Collection Follows Broader Music Industry Shift</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The release comes on the heels of several other musicians exploring web3. Since May 2023, <a href="https://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/avenged-sevenfold-heavy-metal-approach-token-gated-ticketing-">Avenged Sevenfold has been providing fans access</a> to upcoming tour tickets through NFTs.</p>
<p>Additionally, on the same day as Megadeth&#8217;s announcement, the blockchain-based music platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-jackson-s-first-ever-studio-demo-to-be-released-on-blockchain">anotherblock revealed plans</a> to drop an unreleased Michael Jackson demo on December 7.</p>
<p>The ongoing wave of experimentation indicates that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/art-auction-giant-sothebys-unveils-on-chain-nft-secondary-marketplace.htm">major artists</a> are attracted to the prospect of using web3 to provide fans with new avenues of access, engagement, and ownership.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/">NFTs</a> may be taking a backseat to AI currently, the technology remains appealing for its ability to cultivate direct artist-fan connections. With their deep fanbase and metal ethos, Megadeth is well-positioned to creatively deploy NFTs. Their Vic Rattlehead collection marks the latest attempt by a storied music act to explore the possibilities of web3.</p>

<p>Digital assets hedge fund North Rock Digital recently predicted Stacks could experience substantial rerating by investors, citing its strong fundamentals and upcoming events like the BTC spot ETF approval and the Nakamoto STX upgrade.</p>
<p>Technical analysis shows STX facing resistance around the $1.20 mark, with potential future resistances at around $1.50 and $1.75.</p>
<p>Conflux (CFX) has also seen a noteworthy 33% uptick yesterday, reaching a five-month high of $0.23.</p>
<p>This increase has pushed the CFX price above its immediate resistance zone and 20-day EMA, signaling a strong uptrend.</p>
<p>The support level for Conflux is around $0.17 with resistance near $0.23, suggesting potential volatility in the market.</p>

<p>After experiencing a notable 42.31% price increase yesterday, Stacks (STX) is currently retracing with the RSI in overbought levels, hinting at a potential pullback.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for STX stands at $0.7833, well above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, at $0.6885 and $0.6345 respectively. This configuration is conventionally interpreted as bullish.</p>
<p>However, the sharp rise in the STX price and the overbought RSI condition necessitate the exercise of caution among traders.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> has dropped from yesterday&#8217;s 84.84 to 83.71. An RSI above 70 is generally considered overbought, suggesting that the STX price may witness a short-term pullback or consolidation as traders book profits.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram, another crucial indicator of market sentiment, is currently at 0.0521, up from yesterday&#8217;s 0.0401. This increment signals growing bullish momentum. However, given the overbought condition, traders should brace for potential volatility.</p>
<p>The STX price faces an immediate resistance zone ranging from $1.2431 to $1.3131. This zone poses a crucial challenge for the bulls. A clear break and close above this zone could open the door for further upward momentum.</p>
<p>Conversely, Stacks finds immediate support in the horizontal zone of $1.0085 to $1.0615, which aligns with the Fib 0.236 level at $1.04477. Should any bearish reversal occur, this zone will be critical in preventing further decline.</p>
<p>While the bullish momentum is undeniable in the STX price, the current overbought conditions hint at the possibility of a short-term retracement or consolidation.</p>
<p>Traders should be prepared for potential price volatility and monitor the immediate support and resistance zones closely.</p>
<p>The decisive breakout or breakdown from these zones will likely dictate the next move for the STX price.</p>

<p>A recent surge in the CFX price has seen the cryptocurrency experience a 33% upswing, pushing it toward its immediate resistance level.</p>
<p>Conflux (CFX), however, has encountered slight selling pressure around this resistance level. Currently trading at $0.2163, it&#8217;s down by 1.68% so far today.</p>
<p>The CFX price has retraced to its Fib 0.236 level of $0.2090, suggesting a potential consolidation around this area before the next upward move.</p>
<p>The 20-day <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp">Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</a> for the CFX price stands at $0.1682, well above the 50-day EMA of $0.1571 and the 100-day EMA of $0.1550.</p>
<p>This substantial gap between short-term and long-term EMAs typically indicates a bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>However, given the current price movement, traders should exercise caution and not rely solely on these indicators.</p>
<p>CFX&#8217;s RSI currently reads at 73, dropping slightly from yesterday&#8217;s 73.31.</p>
<p>This suggests the asset is nearing overbought levels, meaning the CFX price could face selling pressure soon.</p>
<p>However, this isn&#8217;t a definitive signal and should be considered alongside other indicators.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram for CFX stands at 0.0061, up from yesterday&#8217;s 0.0042.</p>
<p>This positive value indicates a bullish momentum, which could further influence the CFX price.</p>
<p>Looking at the market structure, the CFX price has a current swing high resistance zone of $0.2218 to $0.2301.</p>
<p>Beyond this, there&#8217;s an overhead resistance range of $0.2407 to $0.2484. If the CFX price can overcome these resistance levels, it could fuel a bullish trend.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, there&#8217;s an immediate support zone lying between $0.2073 and $0.2127.</p>
<p>Notably, this zone is in confluence with the Fib 0.236 level of $0.2090.</p>
<p>Should this level fail to hold, the CFX price may experience a further decline.</p>
<p>The CFX price currently presents a mixed picture with indicators suggesting both bullish and bearish possibilities.</p>
<p>Traders should closely monitor the key resistance and support levels mentioned above.</p>

<p>KuCoin (KCS) is currently striding ahead with a significant 16.01% uptick so far today, trading at a compelling $9.731.</p>
<p>This bullish move is occurring as the KCS price attempts to breach multiple resistance barriers.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for KCS price stands at $7.703, and the 50-day EMA at $6.593, significantly below the current price. The 100-day EMA sits at $5.974, also well beneath the current quote.</p>
<p>Generally, when short-term EMAs cross above longer-term EMAs, it&#8217;s a bullish signal.</p>
<p>In this case, all three EMAs are far below the current KCS price, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>The KCS price is also bolstered by a strong RSI reading of 82.45, up from yesterday&#8217;s 73.32.</p>
<p>This acceleration hints at a strong bullish momentum, but traders should tread cautiously.</p>
<p>An RSI over 70 often signifies overbought conditions, potentially leading to a price correction.</p>
<p>In addition to the EMA and RSI, the MACD histogram also signals a bullish trend.</p>
<p>Displaying a value of 0.070, up from yesterday&#8217;s -0.013, it exhibits a newly formed bullish MACD crossover.</p>
<p>This crossover is a potent buy signal, suggesting that the upward momentum of the KCS price may well continue.</p>
<p>KCS price is currently challenging multiple resistance levels, beginning with $8.671 to $8.10 and $9.404 to $9.495.</p>
<p>Given the strong bullish indicators, it&#8217;s likely that these levels will be broken and converted into support zones in the coming days.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is at the $9.901 to $9.953 range, inching closely to the $10 psychological level.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the immediate support for KCS price lies in the horizontal zone of $8.061 to $8.399.</p>
<p>The bullish momentum indicates that the current resistance levels of $8.671 to $8.10 and $9.404 to $9.495 may transition into support zones in the immediate term.</p>
<p>The technical indicators paint a bullish picture for the KCS price.</p>
<p>The current upswing, coupled with favorable technical indicators, suggests that this trend could continue in the near term.</p>
<p>However, traders must remain vigilant, given the relatively high RSI and the potential for a price correction.</p>
<p>As always, investors are encouraged to trade within their risk tolerance and keep abreast of market developments.</p>
<p>While hot cryptos grab headlines, quiet presales can provide access to new projects on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and Bitcoin Minetrix are two catching attention, hoping to capitalize on hot niche opportunities in the crypto space.</p>
<h2><strong>Overlooked Bitcoin Alternatives With Potential in 2023 and Beyond</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Bitcoin remains the most widely-held cryptocurrency, some investors are exploring <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">Bitcoin alternatives that have yet to gain mainstream adoption</a>.</p>
<p>Investing early in carefully selected new crypto projects can provide exposure at a fraction of potential future valuations.</p>
<p>Two overlooked cryptocurrencies currently raising funds are Bitcoin ETF Token and Bitcoin Minetrix.</p>
<p>These new blockchain-based concepts seek to disrupt the established finance and bitcoin mining sectors, respectively.</p>
<p>Getting in early on these lesser-known presales presents upside potential before wider market recognition kicks in.</p>
<p>Rather than sticking solely to major cryptocurrencies, these presales may provide early entry to pioneering crypto projects and business models.</p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin ETF&#8217;s BTCETF Token Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now for Bitcoin ETF Followers</strong></h3>

<p>This jump comes amid anticipation that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> may finally approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024.</p>
<p>One project positioned to benefit from a potential positive SEC decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs is Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF).</p>

<p>This reduction intends to increase the value of the remaining tokens as demand rises.</p>
<p>While any investment contains risks, the Bitcoin ETF Token team remains confident given the positive momentum around Bitcoin and increasing appetite for crypto ETF products.</p>
<p>With the presale nearing its end, the project hopes to capitalize on enthusiasm from both crypto veterans and mainstream investors looking to get exposure to what many consider the best crypto to buy now.</p>

<h3>BTCMTX: The Best Crypto to Buy Now for Potential Bitcoin Mining Rewards</h3>
<p>A new cryptocurrency project called Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $4.87 million so far in an ongoing presale for its token BTCMTX.</p>

<p>In recent years, cryptocurrencies have captivated investors with their volatility and potential for significant returns. Trading in an unpredictable crypto market can prove challenging even for seasoned investors, however. This has led to a shift towards more data-driven investment strategies in the sector, with professional traders relying more and more on AI and predictive analytics. As one of the latest trends, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are appearing as powerful tools for crypto analytics and predictions.</p>
<p>A new platform called yPredict is using the power of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/here-are-most-bullish-ai-coins-of-2023-render-fetchai-ypredict.htm">AI and machine learning</a> to provide crypto traders with an edge. The project centers around its native utility token, $YPRED, which enables access to yPredict&#8217;s premium features.</p>
<p>After launching a beta waitlist earlier this year, yPredict is preparing to fully debut its AI-powered crypto investing tools. This includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">trading signals</a>, sentiment analysis, pattern recognition, and algorithmic models designed to identify <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-undervalued-crypto.htm">promising altcoins</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/en"><b>Visit yPredict Now</b></a></p>
<h2>Cracking the Code of Crypto Volatility</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At its core, yPredict&#8217;s offering seems well-positioned to address one of the biggest pain points in crypto investing — unpredictable volatility. The platform&#8217;s artificial intelligence analyzes market data to spot trends, behaviors, and patterns. This data powers the trading insights and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-sec-hiring-woes-rising-fees.htm">price prediction</a> tools provided to users.</p>
<p>With crypto charting its own course, largely disconnected from broader equity markets, advanced analytics offer investors a lifeline for making sense of the noise.</p>
<p>In traditional financial markets, most historical data reflects price action. Blockchain networks produce vast amounts of additional &#8220;on-chain&#8221; data that is publicly available, however, including factors like transaction volumes, active addresses, and movements of coins between wallets.</p>
<p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/research/on-chain-analysis-guide">on-chain analysis</a> has become an increasingly important part of crypto investing, and yPredict appears to be leaning heavily into this domain.</p>
<p>Experts use these on-chain metrics to gauge real network activity. yPredict&#8217;s AI models will take full advantage of this rich data source, according to the team.</p>
<h2>The Investment Case for the AI Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For investors intrigued by yPredict&#8217;s offering, the $YPRED token offers a way to gain exposure. $YPRED unlocks access to platform features and serves as the ecosystem&#8217;s native currency.</p>
<p>The platform has emphasized the investment characteristics of $YPRED, including staking rewards, trading utility, and a fairer distribution model. Of the total supply, 80% was made available during the public presale event.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a> has so far raised over $5 million with the funding campaign slated to continue through Q1 2024, and a fundraising goal set to $6.5 million.</p>
<p>In a volatile crypto market, AI-powered analytics offer a new paradigm for capitalizing on market swings. YPredict seeks to put its artificial intelligence to work predicting crypto trends and unearthing money-making insights. For speculators willing to embrace new solutions, the project and $YPRED token may be an intriguing opportunity.</p>

<p>The city of Lugano, Switzerland made a bold move to drive cryptocurrency adoption by announcing today that it will now accept tax payments in Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT). As of today, Lugano&#8217;s citizens and companies can use the two digital currencies to pay any municipal invoice, including property and income taxes.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinsuisse.com/news/city-of-lugano-accepts-crypto-payments">The new payment method was introduced</a> in collaboration with Bitcoin Suisse, a Swiss cryptocurrency financial services company, to develop a streamlined solution for processing crypto transactions.</p>
<h2>Crypto Tax Payments Part of Lugano&#8217;s &#8220;Plan B&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This latest crypto integration falls under <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/swiss-city-of-lugano-and-tethers-plan-summer-school-achieves-second-year-milestone.htm">Lugano and Tether&#8217;s &#8220;Plan B&#8221; initiative</a> — a plan to transition the city&#8217;s financial infrastructure to blockchain technology with Bitcoin as the base layer. Plan B is being undertaken to enable cryptocurrency payments for daily transactions like taxes.</p>
<p>Lugano is one of the first cities in the world to adopt Bitcoin and Tether as payment options for all municipal fees and services. The move signals Lugano&#8217;s commitment to embracing cryptocurrency and making it a convenient part of everyday life.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To implement the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-taxes.htm">crypto tax payment system</a>, Bitcoin Suisse adapted the QR-Bill system to work seamlessly with Bitcoin and Tether, providing a simple way for taxpayers to pay their bills. With the new system, paying taxes with Bitcoin or Tether will be as simple as scanning a QR code and authorizing the payment through a mobile wallet app.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to support Lugano in accelerating the use of Bitcoin technology as the foundation to transform the city&#8217;s financial infrastructure,&#8221; Chief Product Officer at Bitcoin Suisse Armin Schmid said.</p>
<h2>Swiss Municipalities Drive Crypto Adoption</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With this latest move, Lugano joined a small but growing list of Swiss cities and regions formally accepting <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>. The municipality of Zug, the city of Zermatt, and the canton of Zug also allow crypto payments for taxes and government services.</p>
<p>Lugano&#8217;s crypto tax payment option represents a major milestone for blockchain adoption in Switzerland. By giving citizens a convenient way to pay taxes in digital currency, Lugano is bringing cryptocurrency into the mainstream and setting an example for cities worldwide.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) urged a judge on Monday to decide whether certain cryptocurrencies qualify as securities in its ongoing lawsuit against blockchain company Terraform Labs.</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.138.0.pdf">In the court filing</a>, the SEC argued there is no dispute that the crypto tokens offered by Terraform Labs involve investments tied to the efforts of the company. As such, the commission believes the matter is a legal question that should be determined by the presiding judge rather than going to a jury trial.</p>
<h3>SEC Wants to Set Precedent on Terraform&#8217;s Crypto as Securities</h3>
<p>The SEC’s move seeks to bypass a jury decision on the critical issue of whether the tokens offered by Terraform Labs meet the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/global-securities-markets/9781118056622/OEBPS/c01-sec1-0002.htm#:~:text=of%20O'Reilly.-,LEGAL%20DEFINITION%20OF%20SECURITY,in%20the%20case%20of%20stock.">legal definition of a security</a>. If deemed securities, the tokens would fall under the regulatory purview of the SEC.</p>
<p>The commission claimed the facts surrounding Terraform Labs’ crypto offerings are clear — they entailed an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits dependent on others&#8217; work. In the SEC’s view, these undisputed facts mean the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-assets-should-classified-as-securities-says-european-parliament-study.htm">crypto should be classified as securities</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139539" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139539" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-139539" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701797180-7e91fcc228962e3f3cd29c3b8845ff72.png" alt="SEC Terraform Labs " width="493" height="550" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701797180-7e91fcc228962e3f3cd29c3b8845ff72.png 654w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701797180-7e91fcc228962e3f3cd29c3b8845ff72-269x300.png 269w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701797180-7e91fcc228962e3f3cd29c3b8845ff72-150x167.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139539" class="wp-caption-text">The SEC court filing on Terraform Labs Case, <em><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.138.0.pdf">Courtlistener</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;There are no factual questions concerning how Defendants’ crypto assets were sold, the terms of those offers and sales, or what Defendants said in their marketing materials or promotions surrounding them,&#8221; the SEC filing stated.</p>
<p>The regulator believes the judge should rule that Terraform Labs&#8217; cryptocurrency offerings checked all the boxes of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/does-crypto-pass-the-howey-test-8385183">Howey Test</a>, the longstanding criteria used to deem if an asset is a security.</p>
<h3>Court Ruling Could Expand or Limit SEC&#8217;s Crypto Authority</h3>
<p>This push by the SEC comes as the agency ramps up crypto enforcement. The SEC previously deemed Ripple&#8217;s XRP as a security, though in July a judge ruled that <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/crypto/ripple-token-is-a-security-in-institutional-sales-judge-rules">XRP does not necessarily meet the Howey Test parameters</a>.</p>
<p>For now, the SEC is pressing ahead assertively with its crypto regulation campaign. By pushing for the judge to decide on the security status, the regulator seeks to assert greater control in its ongoing <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/11/06/sec-crypto-experts-job-hiring-struggle-oig-inspector-general/">struggle to regulate cryptocurrencies</a>. This would mark a major win for the SEC&#8217;s bid to expand its authority over cryptocurrencies. The court has yet to issue a ruling on the SEC&#8217;s request, however, so the jury is still out on whether the judge will deliver the verdict the agency seeks.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, new Binance CEO Richard Teng stated in an interview with Cointelegraph that Binance is now &#8220;totally different&#8221; from its early days.</p>
<p>Binance has undergone major changes in recent weeks following the record-breaking $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities for compliance violations.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-says-exchange-has-robust-revenues-and-profits-hinting-at-ability-to-pay-4-3b-fines.htm">Teng took over as CEO of Binance</a> on November 21, replacing founder Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao. As part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">CZ pleaded guilty to charges</a> and can no longer be involved in Binance&#8217;s day-to-day operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-growth-led-to-compliance-failures-ceo-richard-teng">Speaking just two weeks after assuming the CEO role</a>, Teng conveyed optimism about leading Binance through ongoing regulatory challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking the baton and pushing ahead with our growth agenda while working very closely with global regulators,&#8221; Teng stated.</p>
<h2>$4.3 Billion Settlement Result of Early Compliance Gaps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Teng, mistakes made during Binance&#8217;s early years led to the massive <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-absence-at-binance-settlement-announcement-raises-questions.htm">settlement reached with U.S. authorities</a>. He acknowledged that &#8220;in those very early days, while we were building up the company, there were gaps in terms of compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe title="Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to step down, plead guilty in DOJ settlement" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Swmc0eDq-Fs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Binance grew exponentially after its founding in 2017, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamelaambler/2018/02/07/changpeng-zhao-binance-exchange-crypto-cryptocurrency/">expanding from six people to thousands</a> in just a couple of years. Teng admitted that the gaps in compliance during this period resulted in violations of regulations and sanctions programs.</p>
<p>Teng asserted that despite scrutiny by U.S. agencies, there has been &#8220;no allegation of any misappropriation of user funds.&#8221; He maintained that Binance always ensured the security of customer assets.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Obligations Under Settlement With DOJ</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As part of the $4.3 billion settlement, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-ceo-teng-braced-uphill-battle-post-zhao-era-2023-11-24/">Binance faces a five-year monitorship</a> and major continuing compliance requirements, including a mandated <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1925#:~:text=FinCEN's%20settlement%20agreement%20assesses%20a,exit%20from%20the%20United%20States.">complete exit from the United States</a> by the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Teng declined to discuss specifics of Binance&#8217;s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. He stated that the costs of the DOJ settlement and SEC case have been factored in, however.</p>
<p>Binance is in the process of paying the $4.3 billion penalty, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ex-binance-ceo-could-be-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-according-to-doj.htm">CZ will personally cover a separate fine of $50 million</a>.</p>
<h2>Is Binance Being Singled Out?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BitMEX founder<a href="https://www.ccn.com/news/arthur-hayes-binance-cz-absurd-sentenced-2-years-probation/"> Arthur Hayes has suggested that Binance received unfair treatment</a> compared to Wall Street institutions. Teng, on the other hand, acknowledged that large fines are not uncommon in the financial sector, totaling around $90 billion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love the way <a href="https://twitter.com/_RichardTeng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@_RichardTeng</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@binance</a> a keep building that means this the current ceo is going do well like or more than <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cz_binance</a> buti know cause the hero</p>
<p>&mdash; CRYPTOBIO (@MuhdMuhdUsman3) <a href="https://twitter.com/MuhdMuhdUsman3/status/1732054599555588362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But he avoided speculating on whether Binance was singled out. With operations in 18 jurisdictions, Teng claimed Binance may become the &#8220;most regulated exchange globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Binance has established headquarters in the UAE to cover the MENA region, and in France for European operations. The UAE offers a crypto-friendly environment known to Teng from his previous role as a regulator there. The EU&#8217;s upcoming crypto regulations also provide optimism about expanding in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have clarity of rules to operate in 27 different jurisdictions,&#8221; Teng commented.</p>
<h2>Richard Teng Stepping Into the Founder&#8217;s Shoes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Teng admitted he cannot directly replace Binance&#8217;s founder CZ, describing him as an inspirational leader focused on execution. But Teng believes <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67493289">his financial background</a> can help steer Binance into a new era. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/binance-enters-new-era-as-ceo-richard-teng-prioritizes-transparency-compliance">Teng will report to a board of directors</a> as the company transitions away from CZ&#8217;s influence.</p>
<p><iframe title="Who is Richard Teng, Binance’s new CEO?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5rrqjNbaYks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;What I can do is bring my own values and expertise to the table in a maturing company,&#8221; Teng stated. &#8220;Six years ago, compared to now, Binance is totally different.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, Binance, under the new leadership of CEO Richard Teng is attempting to turn the page and focus on compliance following a substantial settlement with U.S. authorities. With CZ&#8217;s exit and Teng&#8217;s entrance, Binance claims to be a changed company from its early days of explosive but rule-breaking growth. Despite ongoing legal battles, Teng conveyed optimism about working with regulators worldwide to reshape Binance&#8217;s future.</p>

<p>Among considerations around attractive buys and the <strong>best crypto to buy now</strong>, <strong>ORDI</strong> has generated interest reaching a new all-time-high in a climate of optimism enabling a 27% surge so far today</p>
<p><strong>PEPE</strong> has also capitalized on recovery trends, surging nearly 30% from its established support level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong> is riding a 7% upswing, possibly fueled by MicroStrategy&#8217;s recent Bitcoin purchase.</p>
<p>In line with the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s positive momentum and restored confidence, ongoing crypto presales such as <strong>Bitcoin ETF Token</strong> and <strong>TG.Casino</strong> are similarly attracting speculative investments from investors seeking fresh Bitcoin alternatives.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Amid a robust market rebound, ORDI has registered a new all-time high of $49.660, echoing Bitcoin&#8217;s retest of the $42,000 level.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: $42,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/AvXeth6SNR">pic.twitter.com/AvXeth6SNR</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1731764593565790324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This surge reflects a broader market rally, with ORDI&#8217;s price experiencing a notable 27% increase so far today, and an impressive weekly gain of over 138%.</p>
<p>Year over year, ORDI&#8217;s market value has surged by more than 380%. Such strides in performance have shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin&#8217;s market dynamics, hinting at the possibility that ORDI could follow <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-breaches-40000-level-for-the-first-time-in-18-months.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s lead in the market&#8217;s bullish phase</a>.</p>
<p>Market analysts maintain a favorable forecast for ORDI, underpinned by heightened activity on the Ordinals protocol, a foundational technology for ORDI.</p>
<p>This protocol is a pivotal part of the Bitcoin network, hosting diverse content, and as transaction fees on Bitcoin have risen, ORDI&#8217;s prominence within the network has surged, <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">evidenced by over $46 million in total inscriptions as of writing</a>.</p>
<p>PEPE, another contender for the best crypto to buy now, has been navigating through price fluctuations with a recent rally of over 25% from its support level.</p>
<p>The momentum indicates a potential further surge of 30% to retest its overhead resistance ranging between $0.000001713 and $0.000001770.</p>
<p>Currently trading around $0.000001357, PEPE is up by 12.52% so far today.</p>
<p>The meme coin&#8217;s steady performance above the 100-day exponential moving average suggests the token has stable upward momentum.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash is also witnessing a positive price movement, with a 7% increase so far today placing it at a trading price of $247.9.</p>
<p>The uptrend in Bitcoin Cash is part of the overall uptick in the cryptocurrency market, spurred by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategys-michael-saylor-is-now-in-almost-2-billion-profit-from-bitcoin-holdings-will-he-sell.htm">MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin acquisition</a> and the consequent rise in market optimism.</p>
<p>Amidst this dynamic market, the crypto presale space is also attracting attention, with offerings such as Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino presenting new investment opportunities.</p>
<p>As fresh cryptos launch in presale, investors closely track these early-stage opportunities that may become the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">next big cryptocurrencies to buy</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>ORDI Price Soars to New Heights in Price Discovery Mode</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_139171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139171" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139171" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart.png" alt="ORDI price tradingview chart" width="1814" height="850" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart.png 1814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-1024x480.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-768x360.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-1536x720.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701723759-12-04-23-cn-ordi-chart-150x70.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139171" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ORDIUSDT/">ORDIUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ORDI price has been on a tear recently, with a rise of nearly 150% from its support around the Fib 0.382 level of $18.449.</p>
<p>A surge of 27.43% in the current trading day alone has pushed the price to a record $48.131, as ORDI successfully ventured into price discovery mode.</p>
<p>This momentum suggests that the path to least resistance is currently on the upside.</p>
<p>Looking at key technical indicators, we see a compelling story unfolding for ORDI&#8217;s immediate future.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the ORDI price is at $24.967, significantly above both the 50-day EMA of $17.742 and the 100-day EMA of $12.801.</p>
<p>This widening gap between the short-term and long-term EMAs indicates a strong bullish momentum in the ORDI price.</p>
<p>The RSI for ORDI, which stands at 84.79, up from yesterday&#8217;s 79.34, is well into the overbought territory.</p>
<p>Typically, an RSI above 70 suggests that the asset may be overbought and due for a correction.</p>
<p>However, during strong trends, assets can remain overbought for extended periods.</p>
<p>The sharp rise in the RSI underscores the robust buying sentiment that has propelled the ORDI price to its current highs.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram further accentuates the bullish picture, with a reading of 1.928, a considerable increase from yesterday&#8217;s 0.822.</p>
<p>This growing positive value is indicative of the bullish sentiment gaining further momentum, which could boost the ORDI price even more.</p>
<p>The immediate resistance for the ORDI price lies at the psychological level of $50, followed by the Extended Fib -1 level of $52.910.</p>
<p>The ability of ORDI to break through these resistance levels could signal a continuation of its upward trend.</p>
<p>However, traders should also keep an eye on potential support levels.</p>
<p>The first immediate support can be found at the Extended Fib -0.786 level of $47.573.</p>
<p>If the ORDI price were to experience a pullback, this could serve as a critical line of defense.</p>
<p>Further down, the Extended Fib -0.618 level of $43.384 could also provide support.</p>
<p>As the ORDI price heads into uncharted territory, traders and investors are advised to monitor these technical indicators closely.</p>
<p>While the current bullish indicators suggest an upward momentum, the high RSI could also point to a potential pullback soon.</p>
<p>Therefore, a balanced approach that considers both the bullish signals and the potential for correction could be the key to navigating the next phase of ORDI&#8217;s journey.</p>

<p>The PEPE price is showing a promising trend after a bounce from its immediate support level, which is around the 50-day EMA and the Fib 0.5 level of $0.000001029.</p>
<p>As PEPE sets a new multi-month high at $0.000001497, traders are witnessing selling pressure near the immediate resistance level despite a considerable upswing of 12.52% so far today.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for PEPE is currently at $0.000001149, indicating a bullish sign as it is significantly above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs (at $0.000001082 and $0.000001052, respectively).</p>
<p>Given these conditions, it&#8217;s plausible that PEPE will continue its upward trajectory, with the 20-day EMA acting as a strong support level for the increasing price.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp">RSI (Relative Strength Index)</a> has seen a considerable jump, moving from yesterday&#8217;s 57.29 to today&#8217;s 65.78, suggesting that buying momentum is increasing.</p>
<p>If the RSI continues to climb and crosses the overbought level of 70, it could indicate a potential price correction in the near term.</p>
<p>However, it is currently in a healthy range, suggesting that PEPE still has room to appreciate before hitting overbought territory.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram has turned positive from yesterday&#8217;s neutral reading, marking a bullish MACD crossover.</p>
<p>This is typically seen as a bullish sign and might indicate that the PEPE price could continue its upward trajectory in the short term.</p>
<p>The PEPE price currently faces a horizontal resistance zone between $0.000001406 and $0.000001465.</p>
<p>If PEPE can break through this resistance, it could signal a continuation of the current uptrend.</p>
<p>On the contrary, should selling pressure increase, we might see a pullback to the immediate support level.</p>
<p>The immediate support for the PEPE price lies at the 20-day EMA of $0.000001149, which is closely followed by the Fib 0.618 level of $0.000001132.</p>
<p>If these support levels are breached, it might suggest a short-term bearish trend.</p>
<p>The PEPE price looks to be in a strong position right now, with the MACD suggesting potential upward momentum and the RSI indicating increased buying pressure. However, as always in trading, traders are advised to be aware of the potential for sudden reversals.</p>

<p>The BCH price has seen a dramatic turnaround in sentiment over the past few days.</p>
<p>After weeks of lackluster trading and declining volumes, BCH surged over 7% on Monday to break above the $240 level for the first time in over two weeks.</p>
<p>This sharp move appears driven by improving technical indicators and a breakout from a long-term downtrend line.</p>
<p>As the BCH price seeks to continue this bullish momentum, key levels are coming into focus.</p>
<p>On the indicator front, the BCH price rally comes alongside a notable improvement in both oscillators and moving averages.</p>
<p>The RSI has surged from oversold territory below 30 yesterday to 67.17 today.</p>
<p>This rapid climb out of oversold suggests gathering bullish momentum that could propel the BCH price higher.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory above 0 for the first time in weeks, printing at 2.0 against yesterday&#8217;s 0.6.</p>
<p>This bullish crossover in the MACD highlights accelerating positive momentum.</p>
<p>The BCH price is also seeing its shorter-duration EMAs cross above longer-duration averages.</p>
<p>With the 20-day EMA at $229.7 now trending above the 50-day EMA at $230.3, bullish sentiment appears to be returning to the BCH market.</p>
<p>In terms of key levels, BCH managed to close decisively above the resistance zone between $230 to $237.8.</p>
<p>This area had capped upside progress for over a month. Now turned support, it will be important for the BCH price to hold above this level on any pullbacks.</p>
<p>On the upside, the BCH price is fast approaching the next resistance zone between $270.6 to $278.</p>
<p>This area lines up with the Fib 0.236 level at $272.8, making it a level bulls must conquer to maintain control.</p>
<p>Overall, while technicals have turned decisively bullish, follow-through will be key.</p>
<p>The BCH price needs to hold the breakout over $230 and challenge the upper resistance at $270 to confirm the developing uptrend.</p>
<p>If bearish momentum returns and the BCH price falls back below $230, the rally may be short-lived.</p>
<p>In addition to trading based on technical analysis, research-driven investors look for presales that offer ground-floor entry to the next big cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino are two such overlooked options.</p>
<h2><strong>Overlooked Bitcoin Alternatives With Potential in 2023 and Beyond</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Bitcoin remains the dominant force in crypto, investors are exploring up-and-coming Bitcoin alternatives that lack widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Getting in early on carefully selected new crypto projects provides exposure at a fraction of future valuations.</p>
<p>Two such overlooked presales offering potential upside are Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>These fresh blockchain-based concepts are seeking to disrupt established finance and gambling sectors respectively.</p>
<p>Investing in these under-the-radar presales early presents upside potential before wider recognition kicks in.</p>

<p>Rather than sticking with predictable crypto giants, these presales offer ground-floor entry to pioneering Bitcoin alternatives and disruptive new crypto projects.</p>
<p>Pinpointing and investing in platforms on the cusp of addressing unmet needs before mass awareness can yield substantial returns.</p>
<p>The key is identifying the next big breakthroughs in crypto before the crowd catches on.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Breaks $40K, Highlighting the Potential of the Bitcoin ETF Token Presale as a Best Crypto to Buy Now</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">pending SEC approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> has sparked interest in a new token seeking to provide exposure to the event.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) has raised over $2.47 million so far in its presale, showing why some investors see it as one of the best crypto to buy now in anticipation of the SEC&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>The presale utilizes unique tokenomics to tie the token&#8217;s price to milestones in the SEC approval process.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> soared to $41,448, boosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ETF</a> hopes and a $70 million liquidation from short traders.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SEC</a> meetings boosting optimism, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> now ranks among the top 10 global assets by market cap, trailing just behind <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Meta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Meta</a>.</p>
<p>Which <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Altcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Altcoin</a> gains caught your eye the most… <a href="https://t.co/Iz8bpAI1vQ">pic.twitter.com/Iz8bpAI1vQ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Specifically, the total supply of 100 billion BTCETF tokens will be decreased by 5% every time a predetermined SEC approval milestone is reached.</p>
<p>These milestones are enshrined in smart contracts to trigger automatic supply burns.</p>
<p>In addition, a 5% tax on all BTCETF transactions is implemented during the presale, which will decrease by 1% for each milestone achieved.</p>
<p>This tax is intended to discourage flipping and incentivize longer-term holds.</p>
<p>The presale price for each BTCETF token currently stands at $0.0062. However, as predetermined SEC approval milestones are met, the automatic token burns enacted will rapidly decrease the circulating supply.</p>
<p>With lessening token availability, BTCETF could foreseeably trade at a premium.</p>
<p>The presale mirrors the countdown to the SEC’s ETF decision, which some analysts predict could arrive as soon as January 10, 2024.</p>
<p>For cryptocurrency investors, BTCETF provides an opportunity to anticipate how the market may respond to a major event that is expected to increase mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The token has attracted investors seeking targeted exposure along with the presale incentives.</p>

<h3>Crypto-Based TG.Casino Gains Steam Amid Booming Online Gambling Industry &#8211; Is It the Best Crypto to Buy Now?</h3>
<p>TG.Casino, a new blockchain-based online gambling platform accessible via Telegram has seen rapid early growth with over 2,000 users joining its Telegram community to date and betting a total of $20 million on the platform&#8217;s casino games, live events, and sportsbook offerings.</p>
<p>The platform’s rising popularity comes as the online gambling industry expands rapidly.</p>
<p>Valued at $262 billion in 2021, the market is increasingly incorporating crypto features like provably fair games and instant payouts.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>TG.Casino intends to capture market share in this high-growth sector by tailoring to crypto users.</p>
<p>The platform operates without KYC, requiring just a Telegram account and crypto wallet to play.</p>
<p>TG.Casino&#8217;s ongoing presale for its native token TGC is currently at $0.175, with the price scheduled to increase in less than three days.</p>
<p>Demand has been high, with less than 40% of the supply remaining.</p>
<p>TGC holders will gain access to staking rewards up to 194% APY, NFT rewards for big buyers, and other benefits.</p>
<p>The majority of tokens purchased have already been staked.</p>
<p>TGC also fuels a buyback system designed to boost its value over time.</p>
<p>With the presale nearing completion, the run rate has accelerated as buyers purchase TGC at the lowest possible price.</p>
<p>Major crypto influencers have promoted TG.Casino to their hundreds of thousands of followers. The platform is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12kg38g_fFhXXrwD9kqiwOhH31Reu1ffP/view?usp=sharing">fully licensed</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAz5Z8dG0xuN-qgYRdJOA95clI7-YYGy/view?usp=sharing">audited</a> for security.</p>

<p>AI cryptocurrencies continue to attract interest from investors of all stripes seeking opportunities in the digital asset market. Seasoned investors, referred to as “smart money”, tend to act cautiously when evaluating new crypto offerings, however.</p>
<p>The recent presale success of Launchpad XYZ and its AI crypto trading tools provides an intriguing case that is catching the eye of smart money players in the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/en"><strong><u>Visit Launchpad XYZ Now</u></strong></a></p>
<h2>Crypto Presale Soars Past $2.1 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Launchpad XYZ commenced a presale of its native LPX token in early 2023. The presale has met with substantial interest, raising over $2.1 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">The crypto presale</a> utilizes a bonus structure that rewards early participants. At present, presale buyers receive a 6% bonus in additional LPX tokens, a figure set to reduce by 1% weekly. The presale bonus provides an incentive for investors to act quickly and gain maximum advantage.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The platform also utilizes an NFT pass system with varying tiers based on the investment amount. Each tier unlocks incremental benefits on the Launchpad XYZ platform, from basic educational resources to VIP communities. Higher tiers offer holders more utility in using Launchpad XYZ’s trading tools.</p>
<p>Behind much of the presale excitement are Launchpad XYZ’s proprietary AI analytics engines, Apollo and LPQ. These tools will provide users with data-driven insights and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-driven-trading-strategies-analyzing-the-success-and-limitations-of-automated-trading-software.htm">personalized trading strategies</a>.</p>
<p>During the presale period, the platform’s alpha trading signal Telegram group has yielded exceptional returns for its community. Numerous trades have produced triple-digit returns, signaling the potential capabilities of Launchpad XYZ’s trading algorithms.</p>
<p>The LPQ tool is powered by AI and over 400 data points to generate trading signals and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-breaches-40000-level-for-the-first-time-in-18-months.htm">predict price movements</a>.</p>
<p>For novice traders, Launchpad XYZ seeks to make AI-powered trading more accessible. For smart money investors, these AI functionalities appear to be a core reason driving the presale’s success.</p>
<h2>Smart Money Tracking Launchpad XYZ Closely</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Venture capital firms, hedge funds, and crypto-focused investment funds are examples of smart money participants actively evaluating new blockchain projects. These experienced investors tend to act based on project fundamentals and long-term return potential.</p>
<p>In Launchpad XYZ’s case, its AI trading focus provides a dual incentive. The platform’s presale represents an investment opportunity offering sizable bonuses for early buyers. Additionally, its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/trading-tools/">trading tools</a> could prove valuable for funds employing algorithmic or quantitative strategies.</p>
<p>The ability to use Launchpad XYZ’s AI systems for trading could be a factor in persuading smart money to buy the LPX token during presale. If the tools deliver consistent returns, demand for the token enabling the platform access could increase greatly.</p>

The platform also plans to become a portal bridging Web2 and Web3 functionalities.</p>
<p>While the presale is the current focus, Launchpad XYZ’s technology roadmap provides grounds for long-term optimism. As both a crypto investment and trading gateway, the platform checks several boxes that appeal to crypto investors.</p>
<p>Its presale traction already confirms interest in what Launchpad XYZ is building. As the project continues boosting its capabilities, smart money backers could provide key validation signaling a promising future. For now, the platform’s AI crypto tools appear positioned to continue attracting attention.</p>

<p>Today, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced plans to host a forum focused on blockchain technology and digital assets, bringing together candidates for the 2024 US presidential election. The event will take place in New Hampshire on December 11 as part of Coinbase&#8217;s &#8220;Stand With Crypto&#8221; campaign.</p>
<p>The Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopresidentialforum.splashthat.com/">Crypto Presidential Forum</a> will give presidential candidates an early opportunity to share their perspectives on blockchain with voters in New Hampshire, which will hold an influential primary in January 2024. According to the event website, Republican candidates Asa Hutchinson and Vivek Ramaswamy have confirmed their participation, along with Democratic candidate Dean Phillips.</p>
<p>Additional candidates like Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were invited but have not yet responded. The forum is open-ended and not limited to crypto-specific issues, enabling candidates to voice their policies on a range of topics before the primary.</p>
<h2>Crypto Taking Center Stage</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The upcoming forum shines a spotlight on the growing prominence of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-us-house-speaker-mike-johnson-sparks-hope-for-advancing-digital-asset-legislation.htm">digital assets in US politics</a>. Cryptocurrency has become a hot topic on campaign trails, with candidates like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gop-candidate-ramaswamy-would-reduce-govt-involvement-in-crypto-if-elected.htm">Vivek Ramaswamy making it central</a> to their platform.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are excited to announce the first-ever Crypto Presidential Forum!</p>
<p>Join us in New Hampshire to hear directly from candidates about their positions on crypto policy and a wide range of other topics. Audience members will be able to submit questions. </p>
<p>Local leaders will also be… <a href="https://t.co/B5fqd5TlfE">pic.twitter.com/B5fqd5TlfE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Stand With Crypto<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="🛡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@standwithcrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/standwithcrypto/status/1730693103210635302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While President Biden has remained relatively quiet on crypto, the upcoming election brings fresh chances for blockchain policy to take center stage. Surveys show <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/10/26/84-of-us-voters-say-that-politicians-crypto-positions-will-impact-vote/">crypto has bipartisan support among US voters</a>. Yet concrete policies have lagged behind public opinion and adoption.</p>
<p>The Coinbase-hosted forum will enable candidates to formally share their positions with crypto-savvy voters in New Hampshire. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/19/politics/new-hampshire-primary-all-over-the-map/index.html">New Hampshire&#8217;s early primary gives it special power</a> to influence campaigns. Strong showings in these states can shape perceptions as candidates move into later nominating contests.</p>
<p>&#8220;This special opportunity allows you to hear from each presidential candidate and will provide candidates with a venue to address the crypto and blockchain community in New Hampshire,&#8221; it noted on the Stand With Crypto website. &#8220;The topics will not be limited to crypto-specific issues. Instead, this forum is designed to enable candidates to address the crypto and blockchain community on a range of policies in advance of the New Hampshire Primary.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Crypto Voters Up For Grabs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Currently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-matchup/index.html">polls predict a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024</a>. Coinbase&#8217;s blockchain forum provides an opportunity for other candidates to sway voters who care about blockchain regulation, however. With digital asset ownership rising across party lines, many crypto-focused constituents are still undecided.</p>
<p>By bringing presidential hopefuls together to discuss this key issue, the Crypto Presidential Forum will give voters more insights to inform their choices. The open exchange of ideas may also encourage candidates to take a stand on topics that could soon impact millions of Americans.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> continue to enter the mainstream, voters are pressing candidates for clear stances on regulation. The New Hampshire forum marks an early milestone in shaping the role of blockchain policy during the 2024 race. With the primaries fast approaching, presidential contenders will soon need to cement their positions on this increasingly relevant topic.</p>

<p>The <strong>UK Treasury Committee</strong> released a report on December 2, advising the <strong>Bank of England</strong> to proceed cautiously with plans for a <strong>retail digital pound</strong>, citing concerns that its introduction <strong>could spark bank runs</strong> and destabilize the financial system.</p>
<p><a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42395/documents/210641/default/">In their report</a>, the cross-party group of MPs urged the central bank to impose <strong>strict limits on individual holdings</strong> of a digital currency, arguing lower thresholds could reduce risks of large-scale outflows from commercial bank deposits.</p>
<p>The committee warned that <strong>easy conversion</strong> of deposits into digital pounds could see consumers quickly withdraw funds at times of economic stress, increasing the <strong>likelihood of bank failures</strong>.</p>
<h2>Mitigating the Threat of Bank Runs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Treasury Committee said while the introduction of a <strong>central bank digital currency</strong> (CBDC), or digital pound, could provide <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/063/2023/011/article-A001-en.xml#:~:text=CBDC%20has%20special%20aspects%20that,lower%20costs%20and%20greater%20accessibility.">useful benefits to the economy</a>, these would need to clearly outweigh any <strong>risks posed to financial stability</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Why do we need a limit for how many digital pounds I can hold?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VQ5VMiPLkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Members called for <strong>additional safeguards</strong> to mitigate threats of destabilizing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bloomberg-analyst-crypto-faced-its-own-set-of-bank-runs-alongside-wider-economy.htm">bank runs</a>, including setting <strong>maximum individual holdings</strong> below the proposed £10,000 to £20,000 limits.</p>
<p>The thresholds could then be <strong>gradually increased over time</strong> as authorities monitor the impact on commercial bank funding and lending rates.</p>
<h2>Privacy and Data Protection Concerns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Treasury Committee report also stressed the need for robust <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/people-want-data-privacy-but-don-t-always-know-what-they-re-8165.htm">privacy protections</a> within any digital pound framework.</p>
<p>It stated that primary legislation for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-residents-flags-privacy-concerns-in-digital-pound-consultations-bank-of-england.htm">UK CBDC</a> should <strong>prohibit the government</strong> or the central bank from <strong>accessing data</strong> for any purpose beyond law enforcement needs.</p>
<p>While the Bank of England has said it <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2023/2023/enabling-innovation-through-a-digital-pound">does not intend to use transaction data</a> for policy or regulatory purposes, the MPs said <strong>clear legal parameters</strong> are still required.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury Committee further advised the Bank of England to maintain an open mind on whether a retail digital pound is necessary.</p>
<p>It concluded that policymakers must gather <strong>solid evidence</strong> of clear <strong>economic benefits</strong> before deciding to introduce a digital version of the currency.</p>
<p>According to the report, the project should only move forward if authorities are confident that associated risks can be effectively managed.</p>
<p>For now, the Bank of England is <strong>still in the design phase</strong> as it continues analyzing the complex considerations around a potential CBDC.</p>
<p>Any final decisions are unlikely <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67590468">before the latter half of the decade</a>, pointing to a slow and cautious approach to developing a retail digital pound.</p>

<p>Today, cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com gained key regulatory approval in the United Kingdom. The company announced in a press release that it has been authorized as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) by the UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>
<h2>The Approval Provides Access to the UK E-Money Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The EMI approval will allow Crypto.com to offer a range of UK-localized <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/electronic_money/html/index.en.html">e-money products and services</a>, aligning with the company&#8217;s focus on meeting the UK&#8217;s high levels of consumer protection through compliance with FCA&#8217;s regulatory regime.</p>
<p>As an authorized EMI, Crypto.com can now tap into the rapidly growing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-england-and-uks-fca-propose-plans-to-regulate-stablecoins.htm">UK electronic money market</a>. The approval enables the platform to provide e-money services like issuance, redemption, and payment services in the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The UK has and continues to be a hugely important market for our business and the greater industry,&#8221; <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-receives-authorisation-as-an-electronic-money-institution-from-the-united-kingdoms-financial-conduct-authority">said Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek in the press release</a>. &#8220;We look forward to continuing to collaborate with a global regulatory leader in the FCA in our collective pursuit of responsible innovation for crypto.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Crypto.com&#8217;s FCA Registration</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The EMI authorization follows Crypto.com&#8217;s <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/firm?id=0014G00002antHVQAY">registration as a cryptoasset business with the FCA in August 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The e-money approval represents an additional layer of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-crypto-compliance-by-enforcement-push-continues-as-bittrex-hit-with-24-million-fine.htm">regulatory compliance</a> in the UK on top of its existing crypto registration. With two regulatory licenses in the country, Crypto.com can now offer both crypto and fiat-based financial services to UK consumers.</p>
<p>The UK approval is the latest addition to Crypto.com&#8217;s growing list of global regulatory licenses and registrations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the platform received its <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-obtains-major-payment-institution-licence-from-monetary-authority-of-singapore">Major Payment Institution license</a> from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. It has also gained key approvals in markets like the US, France, Australia, South Korea, and more.</p>
<p>The company seems intent on adhering to local regulations as it continues expanding worldwide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/electronic-money-payment-institutions">The EMI authorization</a> is an important milestone for the cryptocurrency industry as it seeks to gain mainstream adoption. Crypto platforms have been working to comply with financial regulations across different jurisdictions. Obtaining regulatory licenses helps provide legitimacy as well as consumer protection.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges have transformed over the years, evolving from basic exchange services to comprehensive financial ecosystems. This evolution reflects a growing demand for platforms that offer more than just transaction capabilities. Today&#8217;s traders seek environments that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and a range of financial tools. These platforms are increasingly integrating educational resources and community features to support informed trading decisions.</p>
<p>Following this trend of dynamic evolution within <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a>, a new crypto trading platform, Launchpad XYZ, is making its presence known. The platform is currently running a presale phase for its LPX token, which has attracted considerable interest, raising $2.1 million so far. The LPX token, priced at $0.0445, offers an intriguing prospect for early adopters.</p>

<h3>The Crypto Presale Incentive: A Closer Look at the LPX Token</h3>
<p>A notable feature of the LPX presale is the bonus structure in place. Presale participants are rewarded with an additional 20% in LPX tokens, a figure that decreases by 1% every seven days. At present, the bonus stands at 6%, providing a time-sensitive incentive for potential investors.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ has also introduced a five-tier <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-nft-marketplaces.htm">NFT</a> pass system for presale buyers, each tier offering escalating benefits. Ranging from the &#8216;Doge&#8217; pass at a $50 investment, providing basic access to resources, to the &#8216;Elon&#8217; tier for investments exceeding $25,000, which includes additional perks, this system caters to a diverse range of investors. Each tier offers varying degrees of access to Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s resources, such as trade insights and VIP Telegram groups.</p>
<p>Apollo is the first of Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s AI offerings and is designed to assist users in creating a personalized trading strategy. Complementing this is the Launchpad Quotient (LPQ), an AI-powered tool for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-becomes-5th-most-traded-crypto-in-the-world-adoption-rising.htm">price prediction</a> and investment decisions.</p>
<p>The platform is also working on a high-liquidity trading terminal and educational resources on cryptocurrency markets. Its proprietary Apollo and LPQ systems will utilize AI and over 400 data points to guide <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2023/11/29/impact-investing-strategies-to-accelerate-positive-change/">investment strategies</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>During the presale, Launchpad XYZ has opened an <a href="https://t.co/ZUZaIKgy84">alpha call crypto signals group on Telegram</a>. This group&#8217;s performance has been noteworthy, with 23 trades yielding returns of over 100%, eight trades with returns exceeding 1000%, and one remarkable trade yielding 7000% returns. These figures offer a glimpse into the potential effectiveness of the platform&#8217;s trading strategies.</p>
<h3>Expanding Horizons: Gaming, DEX, and Metaverse Initiatives</h3>
<p>Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s roadmap extends beyond its current offerings. Plans are underway to introduce a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-to-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn gaming hub</a>. Additionally, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is in the works, seeking to enhance user autonomy in crypto trading. The platform also envisages a token directory and a metaverse library, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive crypto resource.</p>
<p>The overarching mission of Launchpad XYZ is to bridge the gap between traditional internet platforms (Web2) and decentralized networks (Web3). This ambition reflects a commitment to broadening the accessibility of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, potentially driving mass adoption in the digital age.</p>
<p>In sum, Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s blend of current features and future aspirations paints a picture of a platform keen on innovation and user empowerment in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

Celestia&#8217;s token, TIA, is currently trading at $7.0945 up nearly 11% so far today.</p>
<p>This followed a substantial rise in November when Celestia (CEL) gained over 230% between November 9 and November 18.</p>
<p>Having recently hit an all-time high of around $7.42 before decreasing to stagnate around the $5.50 price point, TIA&#8217;s overall trajectory remains upward.</p>
<p>With bullish projections driven by positive market movements and sentiment, TIA has the potential to retest its current high and could subsequently break that threshold to set a new all-time high before the year&#8217;s end if momentum continues.</p>
<p>Immutable is experiencing a 10% gain so far today as it currently trades at $1.4099.</p>
<p>Despite a slight decrease of nearly 4% over the past week, the broader price action indicates a potential bounce, suggesting a retest of its immediate resistance level, which is a potential rise of 13-17% from the current levels.</p>
<p>BLUR saw substantial gains in November, closing out the month with an increase of over 108%.</p>
<p>This performance highlights BLUR&#8217;s growing relevance and demand in the NFT space.</p>
<p>Despite some fluctuations throughout the month, the overall trajectory for BLUR remains bullish.</p>
<p>With major price supports in sight, BLUR is in a position to rally and continue gaining as its platform&#8217;s NFT marketplace sees more adoption.</p>
<p>Amidst these cryptocurrencies showing dynamic market movements, the industry is also observing crypto presales for their potential impact.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token and Meme Kombat are among such presales drawing interest due to their prospective offerings.</p>
<p>With the market providing opportunities like Celestia, Immutable, and Blur, as well as crypto presales for Bitcoin ETF Token and Meme Kombat, it&#8217;s worth diving deeper into the technical and fundamental factors driving their momentum.</p>
<p>Read on to see the indicators and developments positioning them as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy now</a>.</p>

<p>After a robust breakout from its range resistance at the Fib 0.236 level of $6.1979 yesterday, Celestia (TIA) has been making notable upward strides so far today.</p>
<p>The TIA price is currently trading at $7.0945, marking an impressive 10.98% jump so far today.</p>
<p>The coin&#8217;s current trajectory seems to be heading at its immediate resistance zone, and if this momentum continues, it could signal a more extended bullish run.</p>
<p>The 10-day <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp">EMA (Exponential Moving Average)</a> for the TIA price stands at $6.1420, well above the 20-day EMA of $5.4212.</p>
<p>Such a position usually indicates a bullish sentiment since the short-term EMA is above the longer-term EMA.</p>
<p>It implies that recent price increases are outpacing the average, indicating positive momentum.</p>
<p>However, traders should exercise caution as the current TIA price is approaching its immediate resistance, which ranges from $7.1401 to $7.42.</p>
<p>If TIA can successfully breach this resistance zone, it could signal a continuation of the upward trend. Otherwise, a pullback could be on the cards.</p>
<p>TIA&#8217;s RSI currently stands at 67.08. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100, and an RSI above 70 typically indicates that a cryptocurrency is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the RSI for the TIA price shows bullish momentum, traders should be aware of the possibility of a reversal as the RSI inches closer to the overbought region.</p>
<p>On the downside, TIA has a robust support system. The immediate support is at the Fib 0.236 level of $6.1979, followed closely by the 10-day EMA of $6.1420.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an even stronger horizontal support zone that ranges from $5.1260 to $5.4565, which is in confluence with the 20-day EMA of $5.4212 and the Fib 0.382 level of $5.4456.</p>
<p>This layered support system provides a safety net for the TIA price should it encounter a pullback, potentially cushioning any significant declines.</p>
<p>The current TIA price movement indicates robust upward momentum.</p>
<p>However, as it approaches the overbought territory, traders should be prepared for potential volatility or a price correction.</p>
<h2>IMX Price Bounces Back: Are the Bulls Ready to Charge?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_138529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138529" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138529" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the imx chart" width="1814" height="851" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart.png 1814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-1024x480.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-768x360.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701454728-12-1-23-cn-imx-chart-1536x721.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138529" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/IMXUSDT/">IMXUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following a five-day retracement, the IMX price appears to be finding solid ground, bouncing off the 20-day EMA and the horizontal support zone of $1.2477 to $1.2894.</p>
<p>The technical indicators suggest that the IMX price may be on the verge of a reversal, as the current trading rate of $1.4099 indicates a 10.08% increase so far today.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the IMX price currently sits at $1.2529. This short-term EMA is comfortably above the 50-day EMA of $1.0307 and the 100-day EMA of $0.8745.</p>
<p>Typically, when the shorter-term EMA is above the long-term EMA, it&#8217;s a bullish signal.</p>
<p>In this instance, the considerable difference between the EMAs supports a potential uptrend for the IMX price.</p>
<p>The RSI has climbed from yesterday&#8217;s 58.89 to today&#8217;s 66.25, moving closer to the overbought territory (an RSI above 70).</p>
<p>While this could signal that the IMX price is overvalued, it&#8217;s important to remember that prices can remain overbought for extended periods in a strong uptrend.</p>
<p>Trading at a pivotal point, the IMX price faces a psychological resistance at the $1.50 mark, followed by the prior resistance zone of $1.5310 to $1.5888.</p>
<p>A breach of these resistance levels could indicate a continuing uptrend, providing a good opportunity for traders to enter long positions.</p>
<p>Conversely, the immediate support for the IMX price is the horizontal zone of $1.2477 to $1.2894, which is in alignment with the 20-day EMA of $1.2529.</p>
<p>If the IMX price were to fall below this support, it could signal a potential downtrend.</p>
<p>While the IMX price is currently showing bullish signs, traders should remain cautious.</p>
<p>The overbought RSI suggests a potential price correction in the future, and the negative MACD divergence could indicate bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>However, the rising price and the strong support from the 20-day EMA may counteract these signals.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the future of the IMX price will depend on whether it can break through the resistance levels or if it will fall back to the support levels.</p>
<p>Traders should keep a close eye on these key price levels and the technical indicators to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>The Blur price is showing a slight increase, trading at $0.5010, a 1.64% increase so far today.</p>
<p>The recent price action suggests a possibility of further downside towards its immediate support level, along with potential consolidation at the current levels before its next leg up.</p>
<p>Investors are keenly observing the marker as the technical indicators hint at the possible price trajectory in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Overlaying the EMAs on the Blur price chart indicates a bullish trend in the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA of the Blur price currently stands at $0.4583, significantly above both the 50-day EMA at $0.3671 and the 100-day EMA at $0.3205.</p>
<p>This suggests an overall bullish sentiment, with the short-term price action outperforming the long-term trend.</p>
<p>The RSI for Blur currently sits at 58.72, up from yesterday&#8217;s 57.93.</p>
<p>With the overbought level not until 70, there remains ample room for the RSI to climb before signaling the Blur price has become overstretched.</p>
<p>Traders should continue monitoring the indicator for a topping pattern that may precede a correction.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram shows a value of -0.0023, a decrease from the previous day&#8217;s 0.0010.</p>
<p>This newly formed bearish MACD crossover implies a shift in momentum, potentially signaling a short-term price decline or consolidation for the Blur price.</p>
<p>Blur price currently faces immediate resistance at the horizontal resistance zone of $0.5327 to $0.5651. A break above this level could attract further buying pressure and potentially ignite an upward trend.</p>
<p>However, the bearish MACD crossover and the RSI nearing overbought conditions suggest that this might not be an easy task for the bulls.</p>
<p>Conversely, the immediate support for the Blur price lies in the horizontal support zone of $0.4482 to $0.4719.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this zone coincides with the 20-day EMA of $0.4583, providing a strong layer of support.</p>
<p>A breach below this support could result in a short-term price decline, although the longer-term bullish sentiment may limit significant downside.</p>
<p>Given the current technical indicators, the Blur price seems to be at an inflection point.</p>
<p>While the EMA crossover suggests a bullish sentiment, the RSI and the MACD are hinting at a potential consolidation or price decline in the near term.</p>
<p>Investors and traders should closely monitor the Blur price action around the key support and resistance levels.</p>
<p>A decisive breakout or breakdown from these levels could set the tone for the next major price move.</p>
<p>Navigating the current market environment with a careful risk management strategy could be the key to capitalizing on potential opportunities.</p>
<p>With bullish momentum mounting behind TIA, IMX, and BLUR, investors are also scoping out presales for overlooked gems before exchange debuts.</p>
<h2><b>The Most Promising Bitcoin Alternatives To Buy Now</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-whales-poised-to-push-price-above-40000-will-they-succeed.htm">With Bitcoin dominating the crypto market</a>, many investors are searching for promising Bitcoin alternatives that have yet to gain mass adoption.</p>
<p>Though risky, getting in early on to select new crypto projects allows you to acquire tokens at a fraction of their future price.</p>
<p>The key is identifying platforms on the verge of solving unmet needs before widespread awareness kicks in.</p>
<p><iframe title="&#x1f525; Top 3 Cryptocurrency Presales: Your Ticket to 10X Gains! Don&#039;t Miss Out! &#x1f4b0;&#x1f680;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ffzrEB-Jqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Two bitcoin alternatives currently running <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">presales that offer excellent potential in 2023</a> are Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>Both of these bitcoin alternatives are bringing fresh ideas and seeking to disrupt their respective sectors.</p>
<p>By getting in early on these promising crypto presales, you can gain exposure to what may end up being major game-changers down the line.</p>
<p>Rather than sticking with well-known crypto juggernauts, these overlooked crypto presales allow you to invest in new bitcoin alternatives looking to shake things up.</p>
<h3><b>Bitcoin ETF Hopes Soar as BTCETF, One of the Best Cryptos to Buy Now, Surpasses $2.1 Million</b></h3>
<p>As the crypto industry awaits pivotal SEC rulings on Bitcoin ETFs, the presale token Bitcoin ETF (BTCETF) has attracted over $2.1 million amid surging optimism.</p>
<p>BTCETF is currently in stage six of its presale, with the token price starting at $0.0006.</p>
<p>The price increases incrementally with each stage, incentivizing investors to buy early before the full launch.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just 24 hours left till the end of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinETF</a> Stage 6! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Keep watching! <a href="https://t.co/UbaheRgNds">pic.twitter.com/UbaheRgNds</a></p>
<p>&mdash; BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token/status/1730557515039944976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The project offers a unique use case, rewarding BTCETF holders upon Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p>
<p>This has sparked interest from the crypto community amid growing optimism that ETFs will finally get SEC clearance.</p>
<p>Major financial institutions like BlackRock have been meeting with regulators to align their proposed Bitcoin ETF structures with SEC requirements.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, a BlackRock <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-etfs.htm">crypto ETF</a> could bring substantial new capital into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>BTCETF utilizes deflationary tokenomics, with plans to burn 25% of the total supply when key Bitcoin ETF milestones are achieved.</p>
<p>This scarcity mechanism intends to increase the token&#8217;s value as demand rises.</p>
<p>The project also offers staking rewards up to 117% APY for locking up tokens, further limiting circulating supply as the presale progresses.</p>
<p>However, the staking return decreases as more tokens are staked.</p>
<p>BTCETF&#8217;s presale has gained strong momentum, raising over $2.1 million already.</p>
<p>With a hard cap of $5 million, the presale is entering its final days. Once this limit is reached, no additional tokens will be minted.</p>
<p>For investors looking for the best crypto to buy now while prices are still low, BTCETF presents an intriguing opportunity.</p>

<h3><b>Meme Kombat (MK): Dominate the Meme Space with the Best Crypto to Buy Now</b></h3>
<p>A new meme coin called Meme Kombat (MK) has quickly captured the crypto community&#8217;s attention, raising nearly $2.5 million so far in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>With plans to list on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/exchanges.htm">top crypto exchanges</a> soon, MK could be ready for an eventful debut.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>What is the one wish you want most to come true? <a href="https://t.co/cZPQZ0oaFH">pic.twitter.com/cZPQZ0oaFH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/Meme_Kombat/status/1730543495016775738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meme Kombat brands itself as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-play-to-earn-games.htm">play-to-earn</a> meme coin, incorporating battle games, staking rewards, and community engagement focused on popular internet memes.</p>
<p>Users can wager the MK token on fights between characters like Doge and Pepe in game modes with set odds for rewards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the project’s staking protocol seeks to promote long-term holding rather than quick flipping after launch.</p>
<p>With meme-inspired artwork and nostalgia for crypto’s early days, Meme Kombat offers a unique platform.</p>
<p>Demand has been robust in the presale so far, with the price increasing incrementally as each stage sells out.</p>
<p>The current presale price sits over 25% higher than the initial base price.</p>
<p>Upon completion, Meme Kombat plans to list MK on top cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>Given the tendency for new meme coins to surge in price after debut listings, this signals excellent potential and upside potential for MK ahead.</p>
<p>Adding to its credibility, Meme Kombat has an experienced team led by founder Matt Whiteman, known for his work with successful ventures like Phat Loot and North Technologies.</p>
<p>The project has also received endorsements from influencers on social media, demonstrating its strong position in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>With its accountable development methodology, seasoned leadership, and exceptionally engaging platform, Meme Kombat reveals promise beyond your typical meme coin.</p>
<p>As such, Meme Kombat stands out as one of the best crypto to buy now.</p>

<p>According to a November 30 filing by FTX debtors, the IRS tax claims of $24 billion filed in early November are &#8220;completely unsubstantiated&#8221; and FTX has now requested that the claims be dismissed by the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX was hit with a major setback in its bankruptcy proceedings when the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/ftx-moves-to-eliminate-24-billion-tax-claims-in-bankruptcy#:~:text=The%20IRS%20has%20filed%2047,net%20taxable%20losses%2C%20it%20said.">IRS filed the staggering tax claims last month</a>, presenting a potentially insurmountable obstacle for the exchange as it attempts to recover funds and reimburse customers.</p>
<h2>FTX Calls IRS Tax Claims &#8220;Unsubstantiated&#8221; and Motion Filed for Dismissal</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
FTX asserted that the IRS has failed to provide any factual or legal rationale to justify tax claims of such an immense magnitude, especially given FTX&#8217;s financial circumstances.</p>
<p>The filing stated that despite ongoing discussions and repeated requests, the IRS has not substantiated the basis for maintaining tax claims that vastly exceed FTX&#8217;s estimated earnings and debts. FTX argued that the IRS claims, which currently total 47 separate claims against 31 FTX debtors, were speculative and threatened to impede customer reimbursement efforts indefinitely.</p>
<p><iframe title="How The IRS Is Playing A Role In The FTX Bankruptcy Case" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/udRjjI2ts5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The scale of the IRS tax claims against FTX, among the largest ever levied by the agency, has prompted urgent legal action by the exchange. FTX contends that the unexpected tax claims of approximately $24 billion could critically impact its objective of restoring funds to customers and creditors affected by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-crash-as-ftx-crypto-exchange-collapses-what-we-know-so-far.htm">FTX&#8217;s shocking collapse in November 2022</a>.</p>
<p>According to analysts, IRS tax claims have the potential to completely derail <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-bankruptcy-daily-legal-costs-mount-15-million-raising-concerns-among-creditors.htm">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings</a> if not dismissed or dramatically reduced. Some experts view the claims as a potentially lethal blow to hopes of rehabilitating the exchange and question whether FTX can continue operations at all given the scale of the IRS action.</p>
<h2>FTX Complied With Over 1,100 IRS Information Requests</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/FTXTradingLtdDocketNo122bk11068BankrDDelNov112022CourtDocket/27?doc_id=X2K48SMD5H38U1RMQ67TG7SKI8L">In its motion to dismiss the IRS claims</a>, FTX revealed it has worked diligently to comply with IRS requests for information, fulfilling over 1,100 requests from IRS audit teams. FTX stated it has supplied extensive documentation to the IRS to provide transparency and determine the accuracy of the tax claims.</p>
<p>Despite FTX&#8217;s repeated efforts to obtain details supporting the IRS calculations, the agency has reportedly failed to provide a factual foundation for the extraordinary tax liability cited. FTX maintained that the absence of substantiation from the IRS indicated the claims were erroneous and inflated.</p>
<p>The IRS action against FTX adds further uncertainty to the already reeling crypto industry, which has <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sam-bankman-fried-found-guilty-and-the-crypto-industry-may-never-recover-12999151">yet to fully recover following FTX&#8217;s collapse</a>. The exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings had planned to restore the shaken confidence of crypto investors, but the enormous tax claims from the IRS present yet another complication in FTX&#8217;s attempted rehabilitation.</p>
<p>As FTX continues its uphill legal battle in the aftermath of its catastrophic collapse, the exchange is gearing up to contest the IRS claims which it views as unfounded and excessive. The outcome of FTX&#8217;s motion to dismiss the tax claims worth approximately $24 billion could determine whether the exchange can proceed with its bankruptcy reorganization or will be permanently derailed by its troubles with US tax authorities.</p>

<p>On November 30 major players in the Bitcoin mining industry, Hut 8 Mining Corp. and US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC), announced their merger to create a new entity known as Hut 8 Corp or New Hut. The news comes just months before the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event in 2024.</p>
<p>The merger brings together the 825 MW of energy across 11 sites focused on Bitcoin mining, hosting, managed services, and high-performance computing.</p>
<h2>Strategic Positioning for the Impending Bitcoin Halving</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to New Hut CEO Jaime Leverton, the combination creates the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/companies-pioneering-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.htm">largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner</a> in the world based on hash rate.</p>
<p>With the upcoming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">Bitcoin halving projected to take place in April 2024</a>, the merger is intended to strategically position the newly formed Hut 8 Corp for continued growth and efficiency gains. The halving event, which happens every four years, will cut the block reward for Bitcoin miners in half overnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;New Hut is laser-focused on driving efficiency and improvement across our spectrum of operations to ensure that we are well positioned and uniquely nimble as we approach the halving and beyond,&#8221; New Hut President Asher Genoot said in the announcement.</p>
<p><iframe title="2024 Halving Bad For Some Miners! Where Does BTC Price Need To Be For Each Miner To Be Profitable?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CXnOKd8FBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The merger allows the company to leverage economies of scale and operational expertise ahead of the major drop in revenue miners will face after the halving.</p>
<p>According to Leverton, the combined strengths will allow New Hut 8 Corp to stay resilient despite the impending challenges of the Bitcoin halving. The company seeks to continue expanding, with a pipeline of greenfield and brownfield growth opportunities.</p>
<h2>Trading Under New Stock Symbols</h2>

<p>The recent successful registration of IOTA&#8217;s foundation in <strong>Abu Dhabi</strong> and subsequent nearly 48% increase in <strong>IOTA&#8217;s price</strong> yesterday has positioned it among the <strong>best crypto to buy now</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from<strong> IOTA</strong>, <strong>Radix</strong> and <strong>Theta Network</strong> are making impressive market gains recently, and the <strong>crypto presales</strong> for <strong>Bitcoin ETF Token</strong> and <strong>TG.Casino</strong> are attracting a lot of attention as November comes to a close.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following the successful registration of its foundation in Abu Dhabi, IOTA&#8217;s native token surged, reaching a peak of $0.2899 yesterday. This new 2023 high marks the token&#8217;s highest valuation so far this year, setting a fresh year-to-date record.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The foundation&#8217;s establishment is part of a broader strategy to promote the adoption of IOTA&#8217;s Distributed Ledger Technology on a global scale.</p>
<p>Despite retracing 11% so far today, IOTA has gained nearly 38% in the last month.</p>
<p>If the cryptocurrency can bounce back and subsequently consolidate successfully at current levels, this could open the doors for further upside.</p>
<p>Bouncing off its 100-day EMA and breaking past immediate resistance, Radix&#8217;s price saw an 11.31% surge yesterday to close out the daily candle to the upside.</p>
<p>This momentum comes as short-term forecasts predict potential for a Radix rebound and retest of the token&#8217;s 0.786 Fib resistance at $0.06269 following this upside price action yesterday.</p>
<p>Theta Network&#8217;s THETA is seeing a 5.50% increase so far today, currently trading at approximately $1.017.</p>
<p>The token&#8217;s monthly performance reflects a notable near 50% rise, attributed in part to the <a href="https://twitter.com/LavitaAI/status/1724849974687695012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1724849974687695012%7Ctwgr%5E8d2282918afa7cf4cb70f6510febc3f3afeadb24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsidebitcoins.com%2Fnews%2Ftheta-network-price-prediction-theta-pumps-9-as-investors-rush-to-buy-this-bitcoin-etf-themed-alt-coin-before-it-sells-out">project&#8217;s recent community airdrops</a>.</p>
<p>Technical indicators, however, point to a possible downturn with the RSI and MACD suggesting a bearish short-term outlook.</p>
<p>The resistance at around $1.06 could signal impending selling pressure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino&#8217;s ongoing presales present opportunities for potential investment strategies, so investors may want to look into them as part of a diversified crypto portfolio.</p>
<p>As the market presents a mix of risks and opportunities, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-with-the-most-upside.htm">investors are closely monitoring these tokens for their upside potential</a>.</p>
<p>Read on for an in-depth analysis of these cryptocurrencies&#8217; technical and fundamental outlooks to determine if they may be the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h2>IOTA Price Consolidates After Yesterday’s Near 48% Surge</h2>

<p>The IOTA price has recently caught the attention of traders following the successful registration of its foundation in Abu Dhabi. The cryptocurrency exhibited substantial gains, although it encountered a significant resistance zone that led to a retracement.</p>
<p>The IOTA price is currently striving to stabilize around the Fib 0.5 level of $0.2280, with a 10.85% downturn so far today.</p>
<p>The IOTA price is currently charting a path above its 20-day ($0.1890), 50-day ($0.1765), and 100-day ($0.1709) EMAs.</p>
<p>This positioning is typically a bullish signal, suggesting that buyers are dominating the market. If maintained, this could pave the way for the continuation of the uptrend in the near term.</p>
<p>The RSI has decreased from yesterday&#8217;s 77.04 to today&#8217;s 64.01. It shows that the IOTA price is cooling off from the overbought territory, indicating a potential period of price consolidation or even a slight price decline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the MACD histogram has increased from yesterday&#8217;s 0.0030 to a current value of 0.0044. This positive shift suggests that bullish momentum is picking up in the market, despite the recent decline in the IOTA price.</p>
<p>The IOTA price currently faces a robust horizontal resistance zone of $0.2680 to $0.2746. This resistance level was notable in the recent price rejection, and a successful break through this region could indicate a bullish trend continuation.</p>
<p>On the flip side, immediate support for the IOTA price is found in a horizontal zone of $0.2280 to $0.2313. This area also aligns with the Fib 0.5 level of $0.2280, making it a critical zone for price stabilization.</p>
<p>If the price breaches this support level, further dips could be expected, which might offer an ideal buying opportunity for investors aiming for long-term gains.</p>
<p>The current technical indicators paint a picture of uncertainty for the immediate future of the IOTA price. Despite positive momentum as per the MACD, the price is still hovering around critical support levels.</p>
<p>Traders should carefully monitor these levels and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.</p>

<p>The XRD price, after an 11.31% increase yesterday, has retraced and is trading around immediate support levels.</p>
<p>This price action indicates a potential need for further consolidation before Radix can make its next upward move.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the XRD price is currently at $0.05116, with the 50-day EMA at $0.04915 and the 100-day EMA at $0.05060.</p>
<p>Although the short-term EMA is above the long-term EMA, which is often seen as a bullish sign, the slight difference suggests caution.</p>
<p>The proximity of these EMAs indicates volatility and unpredictability in the XRD price, signaling traders to be cautious.</p>
<p>The RSI has dipped from yesterday&#8217;s 59.72 to 52.99, residing in neutral territory.</p>
<p>This suggests a balanced market sentiment, with neither the bears nor the bulls in firm control.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram, however, shows a decrease from yesterday&#8217;s 0.00024 to 0.00001, hinting at a potential bearish MACD crossover.</p>
<p>Such a crossover could intensify selling pressure on the XRD price.</p>
<p>The XRD price is currently faced with a Fib 0.618 resistance level at $0.05775. A breakthrough past this level could signal a bullish resurgence.</p>
<p>However, today&#8217;s downtrend of 7.60% and the proximity to the immediate Fib 0.5 support level at $0.05429, which was unable to hold today&#8217;s selling pressure, suggests that the XRD price may first need to consolidate around the next support zone.</p>
<p>The immediate horizontal support zone lies between $0.05079 and $0.05254, which is in alignment with the 20-day EMA at $0.05116.</p>
<p>This confluence strengthens the potential support at this level. If the selling pressure continues and this support fails to hold, traders might anticipate a deeper correction.</p>
<p>The future of the XRD price seems to hinge on its consolidation around the current support levels.</p>
<p>While the neutral RSI suggests a balanced market sentiment, a potential bearish MACD crossover could increase selling pressure.</p>
<p>Traders should watch for a bounce off the $0.05116 level for potential buying opportunities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a break below this level could set the stage for further declines.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the XRD price appears to be in a critical phase of consolidation before it can embark on its next potential upward journey.</p>
<h2>THETA Price Prediction: Can the Bullish Trend Continue?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_138191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138191" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138191" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart.png" alt="tradingview chart for the theta price" width="1814" height="847" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart.png 1814w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-300x140.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-1024x478.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-768x359.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-83x40.png 83w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701379701-11-30-23-cn-theta-chart-1536x717.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138191" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/THETAUSDT/">THETAUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The THETA price has been displaying a promising trend for the past few days, with the coin continuing its consolidation above the 20-day EMA.</p>
<p>As it edges closer to its immediate resistance level, the THETA price currently stands at $1.017 &#8211; an increase of 5.50% so far today.</p>
<p>Looking at the EMAs reveals a compelling narrative.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for THETA stands at $0.940, comfortably outperforming the 50-day and 100-day EMAs at $0.846 and $0.782, respectively.</p>
<p>This paints a robust picture of bullishness in THETA&#8217;s immediate future.</p>
<p>Looking at the RSI, it has risen to 62.74 from yesterday&#8217;s 57.51.</p>
<p>An RSI above 50 often suggests that a stock or coin is in a bullish phase, meaning the THETA price might see further upward movement.</p>
<p>The MACD histogram has also shown a positive change, moving to -0.006 from yesterday&#8217;s -0.009.</p>
<p>The narrowing of the MACD histogram indicates that the bearish momentum is slowly losing its grip and a bullish crossover could be expected soon, which would likely propel the THETA price further.</p>
<p>Examining the immediate resistance, the horizontal resistance zone is between $1.087 and $1.103.</p>
<p>This level was retested earlier today when THETA traded around its intraday high of $1.085.</p>
<p>A break and close above this resistance could potentially spark a new uptrend for the THETA price.</p>
<p>On the flip side, immediate support is found in the horizontal support zone of $0.931 to $0.943, aligning closely with the 20-day EMA of $0.940.</p>
<p>Holding this support is crucial for THETA to maintain its upward journey.</p>
<p>A break below this could lead to a retest of the 50-day EMA at $0.846, potentially opening up a more bearish phase for the THETA price.</p>
<p>While the THETA price shows strong bullish sentiment, traders should keep a close eye on these technical indicators and key support and resistance levels.</p>
<p>The coming days will reveal whether THETA can sustain its upward momentum or if a reversal is on the horizon.</p>
<p>As IOTA, Radix, and Theta Network show signs of momentum, attention is turning to overlooked crypto presales like Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>These fresh projects seek to capitalize on the hype surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF and the growing excitement around crypto gambling.</p>
<p>Their early traction suggests these may be smart investments for those seeking viable Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<h2>Overlooked Bitcoin Alternatives With Upside Potential in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As Bitcoin continues to lead the cryptocurrency market, investors are starting to explore lesser-known alternatives that have yet to gain mass adoption.</p>
<p>While risky, investing in select new crypto projects early allows you to acquire tokens at a fraction of their possible future price.</p>
<p>The key is identifying platforms that are on the verge of solving unmet needs or current problems before widespread awareness kicks in.</p>
<p>Two <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">ongoing crypto presales that offer excellent investment potential in 2023</a> are Bitcoin ETF Token and TG.Casino.</p>
<p>Both projects are bringing fresh ideas to the table and seek to disrupt their respective sectors.</p>
<p>Getting in early with these promising crypto alternatives provides an opportunity to get exposure to what may end up being major innovations down the line.</p>
<p>Looking past crypto juggernauts, these unnoticed crypto presales offer the ability to invest in new Bitcoin alternatives seeking to shake things up.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin ETF Token Presale Raises Over $2 Million as Investors Rush to Buy One of the Best Crypto to Buy Now</h3>
<p>As the crypto community awaits a decision on spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a new project called Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) aims to capitalize on the hype.</p>
<p>With major players like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">BlackRock</a> and Grayscale seeking approval for bitcoin ETFs, excitement is building around these potential new investment vehicles.</p>

<p>The BTCETF presale has raised over $2 million so far, offering early investors a chance to buy tokens at a discount.</p>
<p>The pre-sale utilizes a tier-based pricing structure, with the price per token increasing through 10 stages from an initial $0.005 to $0.0068.</p>
<p>According to the BTCETF whitepaper, the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could unlock billions in institutional investment.</p>
<p>To capitalize on this opportunity, BTCETF incorporates a deflationary mechanism that seeks to increase token scarcity and value.</p>
<p>Specifically, it will burn 5% of the total supply each time an ETF milestone is reached.</p>
<p>In addition to burning tokens, BTCETF also uses a staking system to incentivize users, gradually decreasing token circulation over time.</p>
<p>Through these dual tactics of token burning and staking rewards, BTCETF intends to reward long-term holders by decreasing transaction taxes from an initial 5% to 0% after all ETF milestones have been achieved.</p>

<p>&mdash; TG Casino (@TGCasino_) <a href="https://twitter.com/TGCasino_/status/1729204472231141521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p>TG.Casino has recently shared its post-presale roadmap which includes expanded marketing, team growth, product enhancements, and a goal of $225 million total wagering volume.</p>
<p>Several prominent crypto influencers have endorsed TG.Casino, <a href="https://twitter.com/littlemustacho/status/1726692645806703010">including analyst Little Mustacho</a>, who believes the project has the potential to directly compete with the popular crypto gambling site Rollbit.</p>
<p>Seasoned analysts forecast the token&#8217;s price may rapidly increase following the project&#8217;s introduction to the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>TG.Casino’s ingenious tokenomics further incentivize long-term holding of its $TGC token.</p>
<p>Owners can benefit from perks like cashback to offset losses, reward programs for activity, and an intuitive buyback system designed to make $TGC deflationary over time.</p>
<p>As the presale nears its finish line, some believe TG.Casino could be a leading crypto opportunity given its novel platform and early traction indicators.</p>
<p>Additionally, the presale price increases in less than two days, so interested investors may want to review soon before token prices rise.</p>
<p>With crypto gambling picking up steam, TG.Casino&#8217;s Telegram-based model and presale traction signal its strong potential as the presale heads toward its finish line.</p>
<p>For investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, TG.Casino appears to be one to watch closely.</p>
