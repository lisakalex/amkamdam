<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency seems to be on the &lsquo;to-do list&rsquo; of India&rsquo;s richest person &ndash; Mukesh Ambani. He is the founder and chairman of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries and is also considered a top influencer on the country&rsquo;s government.</p><figure style="max-width: 268px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/50011ea1eb.jpg" sizes="268px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a9/50011ea1eb.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a9/50011ea1eb.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a9/50011ea1eb.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a9/50011ea1eb.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p>That is why &lsquo;JioCoin&rsquo;, the cryptocurrency reportedly in the making by telecom giant Reliance Jio Infocomm, is stirring hopes of a positive future for crypto in India. JioCoin may be used for supply-chain management and logistics or for employee rewards and customer loyalty systems. But the project is still at an early stage.  </p><p>Reliance Jio is already a well-known disruptor in India&rsquo;s telecom industry. With super affordable plans and high-speed data, it has forced players like Vodafone and Airtel, etc. to bow in the competitive. Imagine the scale of economic disruption that could result if the company launches its own cryptocurrency.</p><p>Some say Ambani run the Reliance group, but the country as well. Some even claim that he controls the leaders of both of India&rsquo;s two major rival parties, the United Public Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance. This seems to be the prevailing view among the public and heads of the country&rsquo;s other political parties.</p><p>In fact, Mukesh Ambani is the only business magnate to feature prominently in India&rsquo;s parliamentary election. (Note that parliament elects the prime minister.) He is also the owner of the country&rsquo;s leading media houses &ndash; which could explain why they have never written a negative or critical editorial about him or the Reliance group.  Thus the Ambani family, and Mukesh Ambani especially, have a major say in the policy and economic frameworks promoted by the Indian government. </p><p>What does this influence have to do with JioCoin?</p><p>Currently, neither India&rsquo;s central bank nor its government seem to be in favour of virtual currencies. Officially, at least. Regulations are still lacking, but guidelines warn that Bitcoin-like tokens are not legal for transactions or trade. So while not clearly illegal, neither are cryptocurrencies legal tender. And it is in this context that the report about JioCoin appeared &ndash; two weeks after the central bank and finance ministry declared they do not authorize production, trade or use of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>If JioCoin is launched, it is highly likely that the government will be persuaded to make policies that are cryptocurrency-friendly. The regulatory framework will likely be designed so as to give a boost to JioCoin and other burgeoning crypto-startups. </p><p>At the moment, the government is tight-lipped about coming regulations. Even the recommendations of its interdisciplinary committee on the matter have not been made public. Officials are probably busy considering blockchain scenarios&hellip; perhaps with the help of the Reliance group&rsquo;s insights and analysis. After all, a team of 50 blockchain experts has reportedly been put together to work on the JioCoin project under the leadership of Akash Ambani, Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s elder son. It seems likely they will offer the government &lsquo;internal assistance&rsquo; in developing opportune policies. </p><p>Ultimately, what matters is making the best of the opportunity currently presented by blockchain technology. In the past, Reliance group companies have exercised strong influence on bureaucrats and politicians to deliver value for India&rsquo;s people. There is a good chance that this may also be what happens with cryptocurrencies.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin fever had been on the rise in India for the past few months. However, the Indian Government&rsquo;s recent high-handed approach against high net-worth cryptocurrency investors has created a state of unrest amongst the people. </p><p>&ldquo;Every three months, our volumes [Bitcoin trading] have been doubling, and that trend is continuing&rdquo; said Saurabh Agrawal, Co-founder of ZebPay, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in India. A statement by Vivek from Coinsecure said it all, &ldquo;There are high net-worth individuals, trading companies, and corporate entities exploring this space. Experienced stock traders and analysts who study the charts are interested in investing because of the surge in prices&rdquo;. And this enthusiasm by the stakeholders is also developing into pressure on the Indian government.</p><p>Recently, Bivas Chatterjee, a Calcutta based lawyer, who also served as the nodal office in West Bengal, filed a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) for the regulation of Bitcoin. &ldquo;There is an urgent need to frame a joint panel or a group of committees with experts from various fields to ensure the legality and accountability of cryptocurrencies,&rdquo; said Chatterjee. Such a PIL, demanding a regulatory framework and laws for Bitcoin-like currencies in India, is not the only one in India. </p><p>Moreover, another interesting step has been taken by the cryptocurrency startups across the country. An online petition gathered fifteen-thousand signatures from cryptocurrency stakeholders. This petition was circulated by Indian cryptocurrency startups and seems to be gaining momentum to witness some positive action by the government. </p><p>It seems that the government and the Indian authorities are looking for an optimum solution to tackle the non-fiat blockchain currencies. However, if it decides to go with a total ban, the action may backfire as it did for China. China banned Bitcoin a while ago. The result? The cryptocurrency exchanges and sales have developed a peer-to-peer nexus, and the Chinese government has lost total control over the crypto market. Hopefully, the Indian authorities will take this into account before declaring anything about the Blockchain currencies.</p><p>The ITD&rsquo;s action of levying a tax on cryptocurrency trade gains, and the Indian government&rsquo;s silence on the matter give us enough to anticipate future options. It is highly likely that cryptocurrency trading will be controlled by a regulatory framework and laws. It is about time the new policies are released to the people. Pressure from corporates, investors, startups, and individuals to regulate blockchain currencies will hopefully bring out the much needed positive framework by the government of India.  </p><p>Moreover, as reported by Cryptonews.com, the Reserve Bank of India is now more positive towards the crypto world. </p><p>***<br>
<b>Background</b><br>
<i>
</i></p><p>The Indian government has accepted that a total of sixteen cryptocurrency exchanges are currently operating in India. Moreover, cryptocurrency exchanges claim that 2,500 investors are entering this market every day in the country. But a recent blow by the government for Bitcoin investors has rendered the option of regulating digital non-fiat currencies uncertain. <br>
Recently, the income tax department (ITD) raided nine cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Two million investors came under the ITD&rsquo;s radar. Out of these, four to five lakh (a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to one hundred thousand) net worth investors will be served notices by the department. Why? For potential &lsquo;tax-evasion&rsquo; and money laundering activities under the guise of Bitcoin trading. <br>
The ITD now plans to extract tax money from these cryptocurrency investors and even penalize them. It is expected that the crypto traders will have to pay &lsquo;thirty percent capital gains tax.&rsquo; And those who fail to pay the tax and declare their investment in the financial year will have to pay a penalty of fifty-two hundred percent, in addition to twelve percent interest annually on the penalty amount. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ban of cryptocurrency is not likely in India
Possible regulations include taxes and regulatory authority for ICOs</p><p>2018 could be the year cryptocurrency regulations are introduced in India, and although the authorities&rsquo; contradictory signals make it hard to foresee what shape the regulations will ultimately take, the country&rsquo;s central bank is said to be warming up to the idea of cryptocurrency. </p><p>While the government stresses that it doesn&rsquo;t recognize Bitcoin as legal currency and the tax authority seeks to collect taxes from cryptocurrency investors (and penalize them in some cases), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is becoming increasingly positive towards the crypto economy, a source familiar with the situation told <i>Cryptonews.com</i>.</p><p>Instead of the ban on cryptocurrency in India proposed by a government advisory committee over a year ago, the legality of crypto coins might be officially recognized, the source said. Regulations would include restrictions, though, since the RBI is keen to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies for fraudulent activities, about which it has already received more than 1,200 complaints, according to the source. </p><p>The RBI was not available for a comment on its position. The government does not comment on crypto-related policy which is still being developed.</p><p><b>Possible regulations</b></p><p>Officially, India&rsquo;s central bank is cautious about cryptocurrency, though the idea has been floated of launching a new cryptocurrency in the RBI&rsquo;s domain. It has also been reported that the RBI and the Indian government may set up a joint regulator to oversee virtual currency activities in the country.</p><p>An inter-disciplinary committee on cryptocurrency regulation formed by India&rsquo;s Finance Ministry, the same committee that previously suggested a ban on crypto, in a more recent report made the following recommendations:</p><p>&#8211; The RBI should issue guidelines regarding investment in and purchase of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.<br>
&#8211; Returns on investments in cryptocurrencies should be taxed.<br>
&#8211; Bitcoins should fall under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934, which created a framework for the supervision of banking firms in India. Among other things, it defines how the RBI may conduct business as well as the nature of &lsquo;legal tender&rsquo; currency in India. <br>
&#8211; Any foreign transaction made with virtual currencies would fall under the purview of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of the Parliament of India. FEMA facilitates external trade and payments by helping to ensure order in India&rsquo;s foreign exchange market.<br>
&#8211; A regulatory and guiding authority should be formed for Initial Coin Offerings.</p><p>India, where 65% of the population is below age 35, has seen a surge of interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly since demonetization of its fiat-currency in November 2016 spurred a massive shift to digital-payments. Annual trade in Bitcoin now exceeds USD 20 billion, with an estimated 1.5 million holders using 700-900 bitcoins daily. Cryptocurrency exchanges say 2,500 investors are entering this market every day in India as young professionals seek options for higher returns on their investments.</p>
