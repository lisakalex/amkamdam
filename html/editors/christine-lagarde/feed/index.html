This is just as relevant in today&rsquo;s fast-moving world.</p><p>In the digital age, innovation in payments enables us to interact in easier, faster and cheaper ways. But this innovation also comes in new forms &ndash; based on private payment systems or using digital currencies &ndash; which create new risks and pose important questions of sovereignty.</p><p>These issues go to the very heart of the ECB&rsquo;s mandate. They raise new questions about whether the ECB should drive initiatives to integrate retail payments in Europe, and even whether it should issue a digital euro.</p><blockquote><p>We have a duty to play an active role in balancing the risks and benefits of innovation in payments, so that money continues to serve Europeans well.</p></blockquote><p>Today I want to address two major trends that are shaping the global payments landscape: the first is changing consumer preferences and the second is competition to dominate payments on a global scale. And I will argue that we cannot afford to be bystanders to these trends &#8211; the Eurosystem must actively advance European initiatives to strengthen European payments.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="1.-two-trends-in-global-payments">1. Two trends in global payments</h2><span class="replacer"></span><blockquote><p>The first major trend is changing consumer preferences.</p></blockquote><p>The digital revolution is transforming our lives in fundamental ways. More than four in five Europeans regularly use the internet, up from one in five two decades ago. This has had a profound impact on how we communicate, how we spend and how we work.</p><p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/coronavirus/">coronavirus</a> (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated this trend towards digitalisation. E-commerce, which has grown steadily in recent years, increased by almost a fifth in terms of volume of sales between February and June 2020, while in-store sales declined.[1]<p>As our lives have suddenly gone digital, so have our payments: there has been a surge in online payments and a shift towards contactless payments in shops.[2]<p>So it is natural for people to expect and embrace changes in the way they pay. According to the ECB&rsquo;s new payments survey,[3] cash remains the most common way of making small retail payments, with cash payments accounting for 73% of all physical retail payments in 2019. But almost half of consumers said they prefer to pay digitally, and this has increased further during the pandemic.</p><p>This trend is unlikely to be reversed once the pandemic is over. A survey conducted by a consulting firm in 17 European countries shows that a vast majority of consumers expect to continue to use digital services as often as they do now or even more often.[4] In other words, the pandemic has served as a catalyst, accelerating the transition towards a digital new normal.</p><blockquote><p>The second major trend is the competition to dominate payments on a global scale.</p></blockquote><p>Payments are subject to strong network effects: the more users a payment system has, the more attractive it becomes to new users. Scale matters &#8211; this limits the field and inevitably leads to just a few service providers dominating the payments market.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in this competition. The lack of payments integration in Europe means that foreign providers have taken the lead. This is not necessarily a concern, as long as foreign firms are accountable and subject to appropriate regulation and oversight, in accordance with the principle of same business, same risk, same regulation. But the evolving global context and rapid technological progress are changing the nature of the risks that we are exposed to.</p><p>We are seeing an increase in protectionist policies, as sanctions and even exclusion from payment systems in recent years have shown. This presents new risks of payment disruption &ndash; especially for jurisdictions that are overdependent on dominant system providers.</p><p>Europe had a taste of the potential risks in the summer of 2018: outages at international card providers left millions of Europeans temporarily unable to pay for goods and services.[5]<p>European payments are also being affected by technology firms driving the digital transformation of global payments. These firms&rsquo; well-established user networks give them a unique advantage in the payments industry. More than a quarter of the world&rsquo;s population are active users of <b>Facebook</b>, which could give its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/libra/">Libra</a> project a global footprint from the outset. And it is not unlikely that other large technology firms enter the playing field, too.</p><p>This has great potential to drive competition, improve payment solutions and support financial inclusion. But it could also magnify a host of issues, ranging from abuse of market power to ownership of critical data. It could also make it more difficult to combat illicit activities and ensure operational resilience.[6]<blockquote><p>And more importantly &ndash; but so far unlikely &ndash; if the bulk of payments are made using digital wallets rather than bank deposits and are denominated in private digital currency with weak links to sovereign currency, monetary sovereignty could be weakened. In a digital world, consumers must have the possibility to pay with sovereign money.</p></blockquote><p>In China, for example, within a decade payments have shifted from cash to mobile payments, which are controlled by two large private technology firms.[7]<p>The planned introduction of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/digital-yuan/">public digital currency</a> can be seen as a means of managing the risks of this digital transition, in order to maintain trust in payments.</p><p>State backing is essential for there to be trust in payments and money. Money held in bank deposits can be seen as a form of private digital currency, but it is widely used because people trust that they can readily convert their deposits into central bank money. In the euro area, these deposits are also insured by guarantee schemes up to an amount of USD 100,000, effectively making them public money.</p><p>Private digital currencies would not necessarily allow the same kind of convertibility and are unlikely to have the same state backing. </p><blockquote><p>Without a monetary and regulatory anchor, the stability of payment systems would essentially depend on the safety of private money issuers.</p></blockquote><p>People are clearly aware of these risks. A recent survey by the <b>Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum</b> shows that central banks enjoy a higher level of trust than commercial banks, credit card companies and technology firms, including as potential issuers of digital currency.[8]<h2 data-param="1" id="2.-initiatives-to-strengthen-european-payments">2. Initiatives to strengthen European payments</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So what are the implications for European payments?</p><p><b>First</b>, we must ensure that how we pay, and the systems that support our payments, continue to modernise along with the people who use them &ndash; European consumers, in other words. Here at the ECB, it is our duty to ensure that people have access to riskless, low-cost means of payment, as well as state-of-the-art payment services that reflect our changing economy.</p><p><b>And second</b>, given our size and influence, in Europe we have a responsibility to ensure that our citizens have choice and cannot be excluded from the payments ecosystem due to the unilateral actions of others. We need to ensure that European payments are fit for a global digital economy so that, in the face of changing risks, we can preserve the autonomy of European payments.</p><p>The Eurosystem has already reacted to technological change by launching innovative back-end payment solutions with a pan-European reach, such as the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) service. But we know that the private sector, by contrast, has made far less progress on delivering a pan-European solution for retail payments.</p><blockquote><p>Ten European countries still have domestic card schemes that do not accept cards from other Member States, despite major efforts to integrate payment networks in Europe. </p></blockquote><p>And only a fraction of the more than 230 innovative fintech solutions available last year were useable for all of the most common daily transactions &ndash; online, in shops and peer to peer.[9]<p>So the Eurosystem has set out its priorities, which are reflected in its retail payments strategy.[10] It offers a conceptual vision for engaging the private sector to fill the gaps in our payments ecosystem in ways that promote financial inclusion and cohesion within Europe. The new European Payments Initiative launched by 16 European banks is an important part of this.</p><p>This initiative aims to offer a pan-European payment solution that is secure, cheap and widely accepted. It will leverage the ultra-fast TIPS infrastructure, which allows to settle payments in real time, at any time of day, on every day of the year. It also offers advantages from the perspective of European autonomy &ndash; as a complement to international card providers, it increases our resilience.</p><p>But alongside private sector solutions, central banks must anticipate change. They not only need to look closely at the benefits that digital innovations can bring, they also need to examine the significant risks they pose and be prepared to innovate themselves. This is the starting point for the discussion on whether the Eurosystem needs to introduce a digital euro.</p><blockquote><p>Introducing a digital euro would allow the Eurosystem to be at the cutting edge of innovation. </p></blockquote><p>In theory, a central bank digital currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDC</a>) can be designed for wholesale or general-purpose use. Digital wholesale money is not new, as banks have been able to access central bank money for decades. But new technology can be used to make settling financial transactions more efficient. It also opens the possibility of a retail CBDC, which would be very innovative in that it would be accessible to a wide audience. </p><p><b>Introducing a digital euro for use in retail payments involves three considerations:</b></p><p><b>The first</b> is maintaining access to central bank money. The Eurosystem will continue to ensure that all citizens have access to banknotes at all times. A digital euro, in any event, would be a complement to, not a substitute for cash. Together they would support financial inclusion and offer a choice to consumers. This is in line with our policy of respecting consumer preferences when it comes to means of payment.</p><p>While helping to address the consequences of a decline in the use of cash, a digital euro would also ensure that sovereign money remains at the core of European payment systems. And it would support innovation by providing an alternative to private forms of money for fast and efficient payments in Europe and beyond.</p><p><b>The second</b> consideration for introducing a digital euro is that it could create risks that need to be carefully assessed. If significant amounts of bank deposits move into a digital euro, that may fundamentally change the role played by the banking sector in financing the economy, which would have implications for how we at the ECB implement monetary policy and support financial stability. We need to ensure that a digital euro, in the event that it is introduced, is designed in a way that contains these risks.</p><p><b>The third</b> consideration is that a digital euro would need to be designed to meet the public&rsquo;s demand for digital payments, without discouraging or crowding out private payment solutions. It would have to embrace the respective strengths of both the Eurosystem and the private sector to ensure that the payments landscape remains competitive and innovative.</p><blockquote><p>The Eurosystem has so far not made a decision on whether to introduce a digital euro. But, like many other central banks around the world, we are exploring the benefits, risks and operational challenges of doing so. The findings of a Eurosystem taskforce are expected to be presented to the public in the coming weeks, followed by the launch of a public consultation.</p></blockquote><p>These efforts form part of our readiness to face the ongoing digital transformation in retail payments, which does not necessarily follow a linear path.</p><p>As Rudi Dornbusch cautioned, &ldquo;in economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.&rdquo;</p><p>Central banks can and should, within their mandates, be agents of change and fulfil their responsibilities towards citizens.<br>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dizzying gyrations of crypto-assets such as Bitcoin invite comparisons with the tulip mania that swept Holland in the 17th century and the recent dot-com bubble. With more than 1,600 crypto-assets in circulation, it seems inevitable that many will not survive the process of creative destruction.</p><figure class="left"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ad/5cc5ce0157.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ad/5cc5ce0157.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5ad/5cc5ce0157.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5ad/5cc5ce0157.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5ad/5cc5ce0157.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5ad/5cc5ce0157.jpg 1024w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Christine Lagarde. Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/addressing-the-dark-side-of-the-crypto-world-1398.htm">In my blog last month</a>, I looked at the dark side of crypto-assets, including their potential use for money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Here, I want to examine the promise they offer. A judicious look at crypto-assets should lead us to neither crypto-condemnation nor crypto-euphoria.</p><p>Just as a few technologies that emerged from the dot-com era have transformed our lives, the crypto-assets that survive could have a significant impact on how we save, invest and pay our bills. That is why policymakers should keep an open mind and work toward &shy;&shy;an even-handed regulatory framework that minimizes risks while allowing the creative process to bear fruit. This was one of the points I made in a speech at the Ba&shy;nk of England last year.</p><p>What are some of the potential benefits? Answers are already starting to take shape.</p><p><b>Fast, inexpensive</b></p><ul><li>Crypto-assets enable fast and inexpensive financial transactions, while offering some of the convenience of cash. Some payment services now make overseas transfers in a matter of hours, not days. If privately issued crypto-assets remain risky and unstable, there may be demand for central banks to provide digital forms of money&#8213;an idea we explore in the forthcoming Global Financial Stability Report.</li></ul><ul><li>The underlying technology of crypto-assets&mdash;distributed ledger technology, or DLT&mdash;could help financial markets function more efficiently. Self-executing and self-enforcing &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; could eliminate the need for some intermediaries. Already, the Australian Securities Exchange has said it plans to use DLT to manage the clearing and settlement of equity transactions.</li></ul><ul><li>Secure storage of important records is another promising use for DLT. Healthcare companies are studying how to use the technology to maintain confidential medical data while providing access to insurers and other authorized users.</li></ul><ul><li>In developing economies, such advances can help secure property rights, increase market confidence and promote investment. In Ghana, where property ownership is often the subject of disputes, a DLT-based platform called Bitland promises to help solve the problem by securely recording land sales.</li></ul><p><b>A better balance</b></p><p>In my view, the fintech revolution will not eliminate the need for trusted intermediaries, such as brokers and bankers. There is hope, however, that decentralized applications spurred by crypto-assets will lead to a diversification of the financial landscape, a better balance between centralized and de-centralized service providers, and a financial ecosystem that is more efficient and potentially more robust in resisting threats.</p><p>What are the implications for financial stability? Our preliminary assessment is that, given their still-small footprint and limited links to the rest of the financial system, crypto-assets do not pose an immediate danger. Even so, regulators should remain vigilant: crypto-assets have the potential to magnify the risks of highly leveraged trading, and to increase the transmission of economic shocks should they become more integrated into mainstream financial products.</p><p>Moreover, banks and other financial institutions will face challenges to their business models, should there be a large-scale shift away from government-issued currencies toward crypto-assets. Regulators might find it harder to ensure the stability of a more diffuse and decentralized financial system. Central banks might have more trouble acting as the lender of last resort in case of a crisis.</p><p><b>Even-handed approach</b></p><p>Before crypto-assets can transform financial activity in a meaningful and lasting way, they must earn the confidence and support of consumers and authorities. An important initial step will be to reach a consensus within the global regulatory community on the role crypto-assets should play. Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.</p><p>Here, the IMF, with a membership of 189 countries, can play a key role by offering advice and serving as a forum for discussion and collaboration in the development of a consistent regulatory approach.</p><p>For this to happen, we must keep abreast of rapid developments in markets and technologies. We must act quickly to close the knowledge gaps that inhibit the effective monitoring of crypto-assets. There should be systemic risk assessment and timely policy responses, as well as measures to protect consumers, investors, and market integrity.</p><p>Understanding the risks that crypto-assets may pose to financial stability is vital if we are to distinguish between real threats and needless fears. That is why we need an even-handed regulatory agenda, one that protects against risks without discouraging innovation.</p><p>A clear-eyed approach can help us harness the gains and avoid the pitfalls of the new crypto-assets landscape.<br>

This gives crypto-asset transactions an element of anonymity, much like cash transactions.</p><p>The result is a potentially major new <b>vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism</b>.</p><p>One recent example reveals the scope of the problem.</p><p>In July 2017, an international operation led by the United States shut down AlphaBay, the largest online criminal marketplace on the internet. For more than two years, illegal drugs, hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals were sold all over the world through AlphaBay. Before the site was taken offline, more than $1 billion had been exchanged through crypto-assets.</p><p>Of course, money laundering and terrorist financing is only one dimension of the threat. Financial stability is another. The rapid growth of crypto-assets, the extreme volatility in their traded prices, and their ill-defined connections to the traditional financial world could easily create new vulnerabilities.    </p><p>So, we need to develop regulatory frameworks to meet an evolving challenge. Many organizations have already started.</p><p>One positive example is the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which is looking at what new rules might be needed to meet the advancements in fintech. Another is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)&mdash;the body that sets standards for the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. The task force has already provided useful guidance to countries on how to deal with cryptocurrencies and other electronic assets.</p><p>The IMF is also working on these issues. Stopping money laundering and combatting terrorist financing has been part of our work for the last 20 years. Based on the standards set by FATF, we have conducted 65 assessments of countries&rsquo; regulatory frameworks and provided capacity development assistance to 120 countries. Our efforts have focused on helping our member countries grapple with the specter of illicit financial flows.</p><p>But we recognize more needs to be done to get a handle on the emerging threat posed by crypto-assets and to secure a stable financial system. Where can we start?</p><p><b>Fighting fire with fire</b></p><p>We can begin by focusing on policies that ensure financial integrity and protect consumers in the crypto world just as we have for the traditional financial sector.</p><p>Indeed, the same innovations that power crypto-assets can also help us regulate them. </p><p><b>To put it another way, we can fight fire with fire.</b></p><p>Regulatory technology and supervisory technology can help shut criminals out of the crypto world.  More broadly, we are seeing crypto-asset exchanges in some countries that are subject to know-your-customer requirements.</p><p>These advances will take years to refine and implement. Two examples highlight the promise of this approach over the long term:</p><p>&#8211; <b>Distributed ledger technology</b> (DLT) can be used to speed up information-sharing between market participants and regulators. Those who have a shared interest in maintaining safe online transactions need to be able to communicate seamlessly. The technology that enables instant global transactions could be used to create registries of standard, verified, customer information along with digital signatures. Better use of data by governments can also help free up resources for priority needs and reduce tax evasion, including evasion related to cross-border transactions.</p><p>&#8211; <b>Biometrics, artificial intelligence, and cryptography</b> can enhance digital security and identify suspicious transactions in close to real time. This would give law enforcement a leg up in acting fast to stop illegal transactions. This is one way to help us remove the &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; from the crypto-assets ecosystem.</p><p>We also need to ensure that <b>the same rules apply</b> to protect consumers in both digital and non-digital transactions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators around the world now apply the same laws to some initial coin offerings (ICOs) as they do to offerings of standard securities. This helps to increase transparency and alert buyers to potential risks.</p><p>But no country can handle this challenge alone.</p><p><b>Indispensable international cooperation</b></p><p>To be truly effective, all these efforts require close international cooperation. Since crypto-assets know no borders, the framework to regulate them must be global as well.</p><p>The successful closure of AlphaBay, for example, involved the cooperation of Europol and law enforcement agencies in the United States, Thailand, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Canada, the United Kingdom, and France.</p><p>Countries will have to decide collectively that this path is worth pursuing. Promisingly, the Group of Twenty (G-20) has agreed to put crypto-assets on the agenda of its November 2018 summit in Argentina.</p><p>The IMF will play its part in this effort. With our near-universal membership and expertise, including in battling money-laundering and terrorist financing, we are uniquely situated to be a forum for helping develop answers in the evolving crypto-asset space.</p><p><b>What comes next for crypto</b></p><p>The volatility of crypto-assets has prompted an intense debate about whether they are a bubble, just another fad, or a revolution equivalent to the advent of the internet that will disrupt the financial sector and eventually replace fiat currencies.</p><p>The truth is obviously somewhere in between these extremes.</p><p>As I have said before, it would not be wise to dismiss crypto-assets; we must welcome their potential but also recognize their risks.</p><p>By working together, and leveraging technology for the public good, we can harness the potential of crypto-assets while ensuring that they never become a haven for illegal activity or a source of financial vulnerability.</p>
