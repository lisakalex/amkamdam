<h2><strong>Reviewing the Top Offshore Online Casinos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In addition to regulation and safety, players should also explore bonuses, payout times, and customer service when choosing the best offshore casino. In the reviews to follow, we cover all of these metrics and more. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Mega Dice &#8211; Overall Best Regulated Offshore Casino (200% Deposit Bonus)  </strong></h3>
<p>Mega Dice is the best offshore casino to consider today and one of our overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best crypto casinos</a>. The casino has an excellent welcome bonus for new players, huge collection of games and a sportsbook, and utilizes Telegam to offer anonymous, secure, and instant accounts and crypto transfers.</p>
<p>The welcome bonus sees first-time players claim a 200% matched first deposit, up to 1 BTC, plus 50 free spins. The registration process at Mega Dice is instant via Telegram as the popular messaging app recognizes a user&#8217;s phone number as a unique reference to bypass KYC registration.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323833/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice best offshore casino site" /></figure>
<p>Telegram also allows for crypto to be deposited and withdrawn anonymously, with no fees or limits on transfers, making it great for decentralization &#8211; we also like that Mega Dice processes payments automatically and approved instantly.  </p>
<p>Mega Dice supports many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as some of the best meme coins, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The minimum deposit is just 0.0001 BTC, which will appeal to casual players. When it comes to games, Mega Dice supports every gambling product imaginable. </p>
<p>There are more than 5,000 slots provided by some of the top developers in the space such as Hacksawand Evolution. Mega Dice also supports provably fair games like crash, keno, and plinko, and also offers hundreds of virtual and live dealer tables for roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and craps &#8211; plenty of virtual and live poker games are also supported. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/323927/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice offshore casino slots" /></figure>

The Mega Dice sportsbook also covers in-play betting and offers bet builders and specials.</p>
<p>We should also mention that Mega Dice is a safe offshore casino and is available to players globally without a VPN. It is regulated by the <a href="https://www.kabinetvandegouverneur.org/nl/">Governor of Curaçao</a> and payout requests are always honored on time. Furthermore, deposits are made from the player&#8217;s private wallet, so Mega Dice doesn&#8217;t have access to the player&#8217;s payment details. We also like that players can protect their accounts with two-factor authentication. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Wild.io &#8211; Best Offshore Site for Slots</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wild.io/">Wild.io</a> is one of the best offshore casino sites for playing slot tournaments. Unlike other casino tournaments, Wild.io has fair terms and payouts. This is because tournament points are based on win multipliers rather than the amount being staked. As such, those staking small amounts have a fair chance of winning. </p>
<p>Currently, there is a weekly slot tournament on selected titles. The prize pot is 1,000 USDT and 1,000 free spins. The pot is split between the top 10 players, based on points. For instance, suppose a player bets $1 per spin and lands a 40x payout. This means the player adds 40 points to their tournament score. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/119102/316929/screenshot-2023-07-10-at-.jpg" alt="wild.io casino offshore site " /></figure>
<p>In addition to tournaments, Wild.io offers nearly 3,000 slot games. Not to mention hundreds of blackjack, roulette, and baccarat tables. Provably fair games from Spribe are also supported. The welcome package consists of four deposit bonuses, totaling 480%. Depending on the amount being deposited, Wild.io also throws in some free spins.  </p>

<h2><strong>What is an Offshore Casino?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When using an online gambling site based outside of the player&#8217;s home country, this is defined as an &#8216;offshore&#8217; casino. For example, suppose someone in France plays online slots with a Panama-based casino. As the casino is located outside of France, the player is using an offshore provider. </p>
<p>While there is often a negative spin on offshore casinos, most operate solid business models. The main concept is that offshore casinos accept players from most countries. This will appeal to players that do not have access to local casino sites. </p>
<p>This might be because online gambling is banned in the respective country. Or, perhaps the quality and service of domestic casino sites are sub-par. Some players use offshore casinos to obtain certain perks, such as enhanced bonuses or more competitive odds. Offshore casinos are also suitable for players who want to gamble anonymously. </p>
<p>But this is only the case when players deposit digital assets like Bitcoin. When using traditional payment methods, such as bank wires, offshore casinos must initiate a KYC process. Crucially, not all offshore casinos are legitimate. While platforms like Mega Dice and Lucky Block are regulated and safe, unlicensed offshore providers should be avoided. </p>
<h2><strong>How We Chose the Best Offshore Casinos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We reviewed the best offshore casinos on several key factors including their licensing and regulation, games provided, welcome bonuses on offer, and wagering requirements to achieve those bonuses. While all factors are outlined in detail below, it is also important that players do their own independent research before signing up to any overseas casino online.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety and Licensing: </strong>Most offshore casinos are regulated and legitimate providers. But players should still check the licensing status of the casino before proceeding. Regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice and Lucky Block &#8211; which are both licensed in Curacao &#8211; displaying their licensing details at the bottom of their homepage. </li>
<li><strong>Software Providers: </strong>Just as important is the type of software providers that supply games to the offshore casino. We only consider offshore casinos that use regulated and reputable software developers. Examples include Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, Quickspin, and Hacksaw. This ensures that players are gambling in fair and random conditions. </li>
<li><strong>Supported Games: </strong>Players should also consider what casino games they want to play. We found that the best offshore online casinos support table games, slots, live dealers, and sports betting. Provably fair games are also worth exploring. </li>
<li><strong>Customer Support: </strong>Offshore casinos deal with players from all over the world, so 24/7 customer support should be expected. This is usually offered through live chat. This prevents the need for players to spend money calling a casino located thousands of miles away. </li>
<li><strong>Welcome Package and Ongoing Bonuses: </strong>The welcome package is also important when assessing the best offshore casino online. We like matched deposit bonuses with fair terms and conditions. Mega Dice and Lucky Block both offer a 200% deposit bonus to new players. We also like when offshore casinos offer ongoing bonuses for existing players, such as deposit reloads.  </li>
<li><strong>Payment Methods and Terms: </strong>We also explore what payment methods are accepted by offshore casinos. This often ranges from bank wires and debit/credit cards to e-wallets and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we check minimum deposit requirements, payout limits, and withdrawal times</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How Do Offshore Casinos Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Offshore casinos are usually located in countries that have favorable gambling laws. This is often in the Central American region, such as Curaçao, Panama, and the Cayman Islands. In turn, this enables offshore casinos to accept players from all over the world. </p>
<p>After choosing a suitable provider, players will need to open an account. Some platforms, such as Mega Dice, only require an email address, username, and password. In contrast, offshore casinos like BetOnline require much more information &#8211; including the player&#8217;s name, nationality, and residential address. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="table games selection" /></figure>
<p>After the account is opened, players can deposit some funds. The best offshore casinos accept debit/credit cards, e-wallets, bank wires, and cryptocurrencies. Depositing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is often the best option. This usually enables players to avoid a KYC process and have their withdrawals processed instantly. </p>
<p>Once the account is funded, players can begin gambling. Most offshore casinos support slots, blackjack, video poker, roulette, and other popular gambling games. These are usually provided by reputable software providers, such as Evolution, Pragmatic Play, and Microgaming. This ensures that each gambling game is fair and random. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Offshore casinos enable players to request a withdrawal at any time. If gambling with fiat money, withdrawals must be sent to the same payment that was used to deposit. This ensures that the offshore casino complies with anti-money regulations. Cryptocurrency payouts can be sent to any wallet address, providing lots of flexibility for players. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Safe?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The simple answer is yes &#8211; the vast majority of offshore casinos offer a safe gambling experience. This industry is largely based on trust and reputation, so offshore casinos must provide a satisfactory service to players. This means fair gambling conditions, transparent fees, and reasonable payout speeds. </p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that not all offshore casinos are legitimate. Just like any other industry, a small segment of offshore providers do not operate credible businesses. We found that the best offshore casinos are regulated. Many leading providers, such as Mega Dice, Lucky Block, BC.Game, and Metaspins, are licensed by the Governor of Curaçao. </p>
<p>Strict guidelines must be met by Curaçao-regulated casinos, ensuring that players can gamble safely and fairly. After all, the  <a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/about-us">Curaçao Gaming Control Board</a> supervises its domestic casino sites, as it has done since 1999. </p>
<h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Legal?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those using an offshore casino for the first time might be concerned about the legality of this industry. The first point to consider is the location of the offshore provider. That is to say, the casino must comply with the regulations stipulated by the country it is based. This means that those holding a Curaçao gambling license are governed by Curaçao legislation. </p>
<p>Similarly, those based in the UK would need to hold a license with the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UK&#8217;s Gambling Commission</a>. There is more flexibility with European casinos, as providers can be regulated by any EU member. Most hold licenses with the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">Malta Gaming Authority</a>. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice regulated offshore casino" /></figure>
<p>The second point to consider is the location of the player. For example, UK citizens are prohibited from using an online casino that isn&#8217;t regulated by the Gambling Commission. This is why some offshore casinos do not accept players from the UK. This is often the case with players from the US too. Crucially, the onus is on the offshore casino, not the players themselves. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Offshore casino laws are complex and difficult to enforce. Many offshore casinos do not have KYC processes, as permitted by their respective license issuer. This is the case when offshore casinos accept cryptocurrency payments, rather than debit/credit cards, bank wires, etc. In this instance, players are not asked for their country of residence when signing up. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Fair?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Most offshore casinos offer a fair gambling experience. This will be the case when using a regulated offshore provider like Mega Dice. For example, Mega Dice has an automated payment system, so deposits and withdrawals are processed instantly. This means players do not need to wait for payments to be approved manually by the casino. </p>
<p>In addition, regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice offer games from licensed software providers. This includes the likes of NetEnt, Novomatic, Pragmatic Play, Hacksaw, Push Gaming, and Microgaming. All of these software providers must use <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/page/test-houses">regulated testing houses</a> when launching a new game. Put simply, this tests that the casino game is fair and random. </p>
<p>However, we also came across offshore casinos that use unlicensed software providers. These providers do not have their games audited by regulated third parties. This means that games are not tested before they are launched. Ultimately, the best practice is to stick with regulated offshore casinos that offer games from regulated and reputable software providers. </p>
<h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Offshore Casinos?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Offshore casinos do not develop their own games. On the contrary, games are supplied by software providers. This means that supported games will depend on <i>which</i> software providers the offshore casino has done deals with. </p>
<p>In most cases, the best offshore casino sites offer the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Table Games</strong>: All offshore providers supply table games, considering that this is the most popular casino product. At a minimum, this will include blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and video poker. To ensure players stay entertained, offshore casinos usually offer different variations of each table game. For instance, roulette can often be played with either the European or American rules.  </li>
<li><strong>Live Dealers</strong>: Offshore casinos also offer live dealers. This means that players are connected with a human dealer in real-time. For instance, suppose a player opts for live roulette. After placing their bets on-screen, the dealer will spin the roulette wheel &#8211; which is recorded live and shown to players. This offers an immersive offshore casino experience. </li>
<li><strong>Slots</strong>: The best offshore casinos also offer a comprehensive library of slot games. This often includes bonus buys, Mega ways, and classics. Some slots connect to progressive jackpot networks, offering 7-figure payouts. It&#8217;s best to stick with slots with a high <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-to-calculate-return-to-player-rtp">return-to-player (RTP)</a>. This reduces the house edge and increases the payout frequency.  </li>
<li><strong>Provably Fair</strong>: Provably fair games are relatively new in the offshore casino space. These are casino games backed by blockchain technology &#8211; ensuring transparency and fairness. Some of the most popular provably fair games include Aviator, plinko, keno, dice, and mines. </li>
<li><strong>Sports Betting</strong>: Some offshore casinos double as a sportsbook. Mega Dice, for example, offers competitive odds on American football, tennis, cricket, baseball, ice hockey, and many other sports. It also offers in-play betting, allowing players to gamble on sporting events that are still in progress. </li>
</ul>
<p>Players can check what games an offshore casino supports by visiting its website. </p>
<h2><strong>Offshore Casino Bonuses &amp; Promotions</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We found that the best offshore casinos offer lucrative bonuses when opening an account for the first time. This includes the following:</p>
<h3><strong>Matched Deposit Bonuses </strong> </h3>
<p>The matched deposit bonus is simple; the offshore casino will increase the initial payment made by the player. Each matched deposit bonus will come with a percentage amount and a limit. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, Mega Dice matches the first deposit by 200%, up to 1 BTC. </li>
<li>Lucky Block also matches the initial payment by 200%, but up to €10,000. </li>
</ul>
<p>Players will need to wager the bonus a minimum number of times before they can withdraw the funds. This prevents players from claiming a bonus just to cash it straight out. For instance, the Mega Dice matched deposit bonus comes with 40x wagering requirements. This means that $40 needs to be wagered for every $1 received in bonus funds. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players should also check the terms and conditions to see what games the bonus funds can be used on. Slots usually contribute 100% to the bonus target. Live dealer games often contribute just 10% &#8211; sometimes less. This will make the wagering requirements even more difficult to meet. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Free Spins </strong> </h3>
<p>Some offshore casinos offer slot-related bonuses, known as &#8216;free spins&#8217;. The player can use the free spins on selected slot games without using their own balance. So no risks need to be taken. </p>
<p>After using the free spins, winnings will need to be wagered. Once the wagering requirements have been met, players can withdraw their winnings. Mega Dice offers 50 free spins to new players that deposit €20 or more. The free spins can be used on Wanted Dead or a Wild and come with wagering requirements of 40x. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When claiming a free spins bonus, check the value of each spin. For example, suppose each spin is worth $2. If a free spin lands a multiplier of 50x, the player wins $100. But if the free spin is worth just $0.25, the 50x win is reduced to $12.50. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>No Deposit Bonuses </strong> </h3>
<p>Looking for an offshore casino no deposit bonus? The best option that we came across is BC.Game&#8217;s &#8216;Lucky Wheel&#8217; promotion. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="lucky wheel bc.game offshore casino" /></figure>
<p>After opening an account with BC.Game &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t require any personal information, players can spin the Lucky Wheel to win up to 5 BTC. In addition, BC.Game also offers a 180% matched deposit bonus of up to $20,000.  </p>
<h3><strong>VIP Club </strong> </h3>
<p>Some of the best offshore casino bonuses are offered to players that already have an account. These bonuses are often found in the VIP club, which rewards long-term players. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily or weekly deposit reload bonuses</li>
<li>Free spins</li>
<li>Cashback and rakeback </li>
<li>Cash prizes</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, VIP clubs also offer other perks, such as priority withdrawals and a personal account manager. There is rarely a need to apply &#8211; players are automatically enrolled.  </p>

<p>Bonus terms and conditions can change at a moment&#8217;s notice. As such, players should check this before claiming a bonus. </p>
<h2><strong>Payment &amp; Withdrawal Options at Offshore Casinos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Players should assess what payment method they wish to use before choosing an offshore casino. After all, deposits and withdrawals form an integral part of the online gambling experience. </p>
<h3><strong>Traditional Payment Methods</strong></h3>
<p>Most offshore casinos support traditional payment methods. This enables players to deposit funds in their domestic currency, such as euros or pounds. Debit/credit cards issued by Visa and MasterCard are usually accepted. Some offshore casinos also accept American Express and Discovery. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="offshore casino payment methods" /></figure>
<p>However, it is crucial to check what fees apply when using a debit/credit card. This is also the case with e-wallets. For example, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on debit/credit cards, Skrill, and Neteller.  Withdrawal fees should also be considered. For instance, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on bank wire payouts. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking for a chargeback offshore casino? It is important to note that initiating a chargeback on casino losses is illegal. Chargebacks should only be used if an unauthorized payment was taken by the offshore casino. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Cryptocurrency Payments </strong></h3>
<p>A much better alternative when funding an offshore casino account is cryptocurrencies. For example, Mega Dice offers fee-free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it supports some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrencies</a>, like Dogecoin, BNB, and Cardano. </p>
<p>Moreover, Mega Dice offers KYC-free accounts when gambling with cryptocurrencies. Not to mention instant payouts. We also found that cryptocurrency payments come with lower minimums. For example, the minimum Bitcoin deposit at Lucky Block is just 0.0001 BTC, or about $3. </p>
<h2><strong>Offshore Casino Software Providers</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We mentioned earlier that offshore casinos use third-party software providers when building their gaming suites. So it&#8217;s important to check the reputation of each provider before proceeding. To offer some insight, Mega Dice, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vpn-friendly-casinos.htm">best VPN-friendly casinos</a>, has partnerships with over 50 reputable software providers. This includes NetEnt, Hacksaw, Fantasma, Fugaso, Mascot Gaming, Evolution, Playson, Kalamba, and Pragmatic Play. </p>
<p>Most of these providers are regulated by tier-one gambling bodies like the Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority. This means gaming outcomes are fair and random. Plus, licensed software developers have their games audited &#8211; before <i>and</i> after they are launched.</p>
<h2><strong>New Offshore Casinos &#8211; What to Look for</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>New offshore casinos need to stand out in the market &#8211; so they often go above and beyond to attract players. This begins with the welcome package. New online offshore casinos will offer huge bonuses to new players, often as a matched deposit with free spins. </p>
<p>For example, Mega Dice is one of the best new offshore casinos. It offers a 200% deposit bonus and 50 free spins to first-time customers. However, while reputable market entrants like Mega Dice are regulated, many aren&#8217;t. We strongly suggest that players avoid unregulated offshore casinos &#8211; irrespective of whether they are new or established. </p>
<h2><strong>How to Play at an Offshore Casino</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In this section, we explain how to gamble online at an offshore casino. We guide beginners through the registration and deposit processes step-by-step. We also explain how to gamble and withdraw funds from an offshore provider. </p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Open an Account</strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice welcome bonus" /></figure>
<p>The first step is to open an account with the chosen offshore casino. We&#8217;ll use Mega Dice in this example, as this is one of the best regulated offshore casinos in the market. </p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice website</a> to begin the registration process. </li>
<li>Click &#8216;Sign Up&#8217; and type in an email address, username, and password.  </li>
<li>Read and agree to the terms and conditions, before clicking on &#8216;Sign Up &amp; Play&#8217;.</li>
<li>The Mega Dice account is now ready to fund. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Deposit Funds and Claim a 200% Bonus</strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323877/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice crypto deposits" /></figure>
<p>Players need to add funds to their offshore casino account before they can begin gambling. At Mega Dice, the minimum deposit depends on the payment type. Moreover, when depositing at least €20, Mega Dice will automatically boost the payment by 200%. It will also throw in 50 free spins. </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Click on the &#8216;Wallet&#8217; button, followed by &#8216;Deposit&#8217;. </li>
<li>Those depositing cryptocurrencies can choose their preferred digital asset. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies accepted by Mega Dice include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Dogecoin. Copy the unique wallet address and make the payment from a private wallet. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mega Dice also allows players to deposit funds with a debit/credit card. This will trigger a KYC process, so players will need to provide some personal information and upload some documents. For example, a government-issued ID and a recently issued bank statement or utility bill. Moreover, debit/credit card payments will be converted into cryptocurrencies. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Choose a Casino Game and Begin Playing </strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324146/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="wanted dead or a wild free spins" /></figure>
<p>Players can now begin gambling, ensuring that they do so responsibly. Mega Dice offers a wide range of casino games, including slots, baccarat, video poker, blackjack, and roulette. Live dealers, provably fair, and sports betting are also available. </p>
<ul>
<li>Players who deposited at least €20 can begin by using their 50 free spins. This needs to be used on the Wanted Dead or a Wild slot game. </li>
<li>After using the free spins, players can gamble with their bonus funds. Simply search for the preferred game and choose a bet size.</li>
<li>Mega Dice also allows players to bet with demo funds. This offers a risk-free gambling experience.  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Withdraw Funds  </strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324147/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" alt="mega dice offshore crypto withdrawals" /></figure>
<p>Withdrawing funds from a regulated offshore casino is simple and hassle-free. At Mega Dice, players can begin the process by clicking on the &#8216;Wallet&#8217; button. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choose which cryptocurrency to withdraw from the drop-down list. This should already show the cryptocurrency that matches the player&#8217;s account balance. </li>
<li>Paste the wallet address that Mega Dice should transfer the cryptocurrencies. Ensure this is correct, as mistakes are irreversible. Next, type in the amount to withdraw. Click on &#8216;Max&#8217; to cash out the full account balance. </li>
<li>Finally, click on the &#8216;Withdraw&#8217; button. Players should receive their cryptocurrencies in a matter of minutes. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Best Offshore Casinos: Bottom Line</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In summary, reputable offshore casinos offer a superb gambling experience, not to mention fast payouts and generous bonuses. We rank Mega Dice as the overall best option as it is authorized and regulated by the Governor of Curaçao and available to players globally without a VPN.</p>
<p>Mega Dice offers a 200% deposit bonus to new players, up to 1 BTC, and also utilizes popular messaging app Telegram to facilitate instant, anonymous and secure account creation and crypto transfers &#8211; with deposits and withdrawals coming without fees or limits.</p>
<p>The offshore casino offers thousands of slots, virtual and live tables for poker, blackjack, and roulette, as well as pre-game and in-play markets for top sporting competitions such as the NBA, NFL, and Premier League.</p>

<p>Players can start their journey with a welcome package consisting of three deposit bonuses, each with added free spins. The site also has a loyalty program and special seasonal promos that come and go, so you always have a few in the lineup to choose from.</p>
<p>As for constant promotions, there’s a daily deposit bonus that acts like a match deposit or free spins offer, as well as a VIP version of the same package.</p>
<p>The site also covers new game promos, where you get rewarded for playing a new release, and a referral program consisting of a deposit bonus with added free spins.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can always participate in various tournaments or the ubiquitous mBitcasino Races that happen every day.</p>
<h3><b>mBit Welcome Bonus</b><b> Offers</b></h3>
<p>Like many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best Bitcoin casinos</a>, mBit offers more than one welcome bonus. The signup package consists of three deposit bonuses:</p>
<ol>
<li>100% deposit bonus up to 1 BTC/15 ETH/320 LTC/180 BCH/210,000 DOGE/20,000 USDT/48,000 XRP + 100 free spins</li>
<li>100% deposit bonus up to 1.5 BTC/25 ETH/470 LTC/270 BCH/315,000 DOGE/26,000 USDT/71,000 XRP + 100 free spins</li>
<li>125% deposit bonus up to 1.5 BTC/25 ETH/470 LTC/270 BCH/315,000 DOGE/26,000 USDT/71,000 XRP + 125 free spins</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these requires a deposit to claim, and you need to opt in for the bonus when you visit the Deposit page. Each bonus requires a 30 USDT minimum deposit, but we recommend a higher amount to get the most out of each. However, the amount shouldn’t be too high since you get seven days to complete the wagering requirement of 40x. Moreover, you get only three days to meet the same rollover condition for the free spins.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can claim any of the bonuses with any other supported crypto. Besides the 30 USDT mentioned, the minimum deposits are 0.001 BTC, 0.018 ETH, 0.45 LTC, 0.15 BCH, 470 DOGE, and 60 XRP.</p>
<p>These bonuses work only on slot games, so avoid playing tables and live dealers until you’ve completed the wagering requirements. As for the free spins, you get a predetermined set of slot games on which they work, and you can see them on the Promotions page for each bonus.</p>
<h3><b>mBit Shitcodes</b></h3>
<p>For those unaware, shitcodes are special promo codes crypto casinos like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bc-game-review.htm">BC.Game</a> have used to reward players. As they tend to unlock lucrative bonuses and other rewards, plenty of players have been on the lookout for them in almost any other crypto casino.</p>
<p>The hype is real for a mBit promo code or shitcode, but unfortunately, there are none for now. The casino doesn’t seem to use these, but if this changes in the future and we get our hands on a lucrative mBit shitcode, I’ll update this review.</p>
<h3><b>Existing Customer Promos</b></h3>
<p>As mentioned, mBit has a lot of promotions on offer. Many of these are unique, time-limited promos awarded during the holidays or on another special occasion, and you can view the current lineup on the casino’s Promotions page.</p>
<h4><b>The Daily Deal</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139411 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783242-mbit-the-daily-deal.png" alt="The Daily Deal at mBit" width="900" height="664" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783242-mbit-the-daily-deal.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783242-mbit-the-daily-deal-300x221.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783242-mbit-the-daily-deal-768x567.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783242-mbit-the-daily-deal-150x111.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Daily Deal is a deposit bonus you get for your first deposit of the day, every day.</p>
<p>If you transfer between 42 USDT and 279 USDT, you get a 15% bonus or 35 free spins, and if you deposit 280 USDT or more, you get a 35% bonus or 150 free spins.</p>
<p>The bonus becomes available after you’ve made three deposits at mBit. You get 24 hours to complete the standard 40x wagering requirements.</p>
<h4><b>The VIP Daily Deal </b></h4>
<p>This promo is similar to the regular Daily Deal, as you can claim it once a day per bonus type.</p>
<p>If you deposit between 42 USDT and 280 USDT, you get a 15% bonus or 35 free spins. If you transfer between 281 USDT and 531 USDT, you get a 35% bonus or 150 free spins. And if you deposit 532 USDT or more, you get a 60% bonus or 200 VIP free spins, which have a higher value than regular free spins.</p>
<p>The bonus is available only after you’ve made the initial three deposits, and the wagering requirements are identical.</p>
<h4><b>mBit Stellar Race</b></h4>
<p>The mBit Stellar Race is a daily race for slot fans. You can participate with every wager you make. You earn 10 points for every 1 mBTC bet.</p>
<p>The daily prize pool is 35 mBTC and 360 free spins, split between the first 100 contestants. The 30 best ones get a crypto reward, while the remaining 70 share in the free spins.</p>
<h4><b>Bitty Quiz</b></h4>
<p>This is a quiz mBit hosts on its Discord server a few times a week, based on a schedule you can check on the Promotions page. You get to play image and music quizzes with various mini-games.</p>
<p>Both the games and the rewards change all the time, so make sure to check what the current ones are.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Bitty Quiz comes in seasons, each lasting for several months, and every new one brings a major update to the games and rewards. For instance, Season 7 had a 790 free spin prize pool.</p>
<h4><b>Refer a Friend</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139412 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783304-mbit-refer-a-friend.png" alt="mBit has a unique referral program" width="900" height="647" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783304-mbit-refer-a-friend.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783304-mbit-refer-a-friend-300x216.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783304-mbit-refer-a-friend-768x552.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783304-mbit-refer-a-friend-150x108.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>mBit Casino runs a referral program through which you get rewarded for every person you invite. The program becomes available after your first deposit of at least 0.001 BTC or altcoin equivalent.</p>
<p>Unlike other referral programs, there’s no unique link involved. The friend you invite needs to register and make an initial deposit. Then, they need to contact live support to confirm you invited them and provide the agents with your email address as proof.</p>
<p>After that, both of you will receive 200 free spins. Moreover, you’ll get a 30% bonus on your next deposit, while your referral will get the same on their fourth deposit.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that you need to contact live support to get the bonuses, as they are not awarded automatically.</p>
<h3><b>mBit VIP Program</b></h3>
<p>mBitcasino has an exciting loyalty program that operates like most other programs on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-tether-casino-sites.htm">best Tether casino sites</a>. However, it has a few unique traits that make it more appealing.</p>
<p>Every mBit user is automatically a part of the loyalty program. You can advance through ten levels, each with more and better rewards than the previous one.</p>
<p>To advance, you need to wager money; for every 500 USDT (or other cryptocurrency equivalent) wagered, you get 1 Status Point. At the same time, you get 1 Bitty Coin, which you can exchange for bonuses or even actual cryptocurrency. For instance, 1 Bitty Coin is equal to 0.1 USDT.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139413 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783342-mbit-loyalty-program.png" alt="The mBitcasino VIP program" width="900" height="392" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783342-mbit-loyalty-program.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783342-mbit-loyalty-program-300x131.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783342-mbit-loyalty-program-768x335.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783342-mbit-loyalty-program-150x65.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

<p>As you can see from my conversation with mBit’s customer support agent, the casino doesn’t use promo codes. So, if you’ve seen some, know that they won’t work as the platform doesn’t even have a place where you can use them.</p>
<p>Naturally, that doesn’t mean the situation won’t change in the future. Many online casinos have used promo codes at some point, so the same might happen with mBitcasino. If it does, you’ll likely find a promo code in this section.</p>
<h3><b>mBit No Deposit Bonus Codes</b></h3>
<p>Just as there’s no regular mBit bonus code because the site doesn’t use them, you won’t be able to get a no deposit bonus code.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that mBit can’t offer no deposit bonuses. The platform does offer these occasionally, usually in the form of cash bonuses or free spins. You can claim them without making a deposit and without a promo code — only by opting in when offered the chance. Bear in mind that winnings on these are usually limited to 6 mBTC or 0.006 BTC.</p>

<p>mBit’s game library is approaching 6,000 unique titles, which is undoubtedly an imposing number. However, it’s not all about the quantity — quality matters even more. Many of these titles come from elite providers, but it’s worth noting that some famous names like NetEnt and Relax Gaming are not in the mix, which is a slight drawback.</p>
<p>The good news is that the diversity is there. Out of these 6,000 or so releases, around 4,900 are slots, while the remaining ones are a mix of live dealer games, table games like blackjack, roulette, poker, and baccarat, video poker, keno titles, and a few lottery and dice games. There are also a few crash games, scratch cards, and bingo titles, but these don’t have a category, making them harder to find.</p>
<p>All popular game types have representatives at mBit, which is excellent for players who like to mix things up and try something different.</p>
<h3><b>Slots</b></h3>
<p>mBit has 4,800+ slot games, including more than 600 jackpots. You’ll even find original mBit games like mBit Crush, a slot game designed by Onlyplay that features a free spin round with multipliers reaching 100x.</p>
<p>As for the other releases, they come from around 40 providers, and you can expect popular titles like Sweet Bonanza, Gates of Olympus, Elvis Frog in Vegas, and Wanted Dead or a Wild.</p>
<h3><b>Roulette</b></h3>
<p>Roulette games have their category on the site, and more than 130 titles are available, which is a good number. It’s even better as it includes RNG and live dealer roulette games.</p>
<p>All three main variants are present — American, European, and French roulette. Moreover, there are other interesting titles like Mini Roulette, Zoom Roulette, Hindi Lightning Roulette, and Japanese Roulette.</p>
<p>Due to this diversity and quality, we’ve included mBit among the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-roulette-sites.htm">best Bitcoin roulette sites</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Blackjack</b></h3>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most widely represented table games on mBit. The site offers more than 240 titles.</p>
<p>Most of the releases are live, but there are a few interesting RNG blackjack games like 21 Burn Blackjack, Multihand Blackjack, Single Deck Blackjack, and Blackjack VIP:</p>
<h3><b>Poker</b></h3>
<p>mBit doesn’t focus much on poker games, but it still has a decent number, including variants like Oasis Poker, Caribbean Poker, Texas Hold’em, and Three Card Poker.</p>
<p>However, the site has several more video poker games, including popular variants like Deuces Wild, Aces and Eights, Bonus Poker, and Tens or Better.</p>
<h3><b>Live Dealers</b></h3>
<p>The live casino section is good, numbering over 100 releases. The diversity is even better as many of these games come from Evolution and other popular live game providers, so expect game shows like Crazy Time, Mega Ball, Sweet Bonanza Candyland, and Football Studio.</p>
<p>As for standard live dealer table games, you’ll find many blackjack, roulette, poker, and baccarat releases. You can even play a few craps games.</p>
<h3><b>Other Games</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139417 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783472-mbit-other-games.png" alt="mBit providers list" width="900" height="527" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783472-mbit-other-games.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783472-mbit-other-games-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783472-mbit-other-games-768x450.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783472-mbit-other-games-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>RNG table games are well-represented on mBit, numbering several hundred releases. Besides many blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and poker games, you’ll also find the likes of craps, rummy, Pai Gow, Draw High Low, and War.</p>
<p>The table game category actually numbers 800+ games, but many of these are crash games, video poker, and even live dealers that have their own section.</p>
<p>The important thing is that the site has a lot of different games to offer, including a few bingo, lottery, keno, dice, and scratch card games, many of which can be filtered out in the library, so they are easy to find.</p>
<h2><b>mBit Sports Betting</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Unfortunately, mBit Casino is just that — a casino. Unlike some other crypto casinos, it doesn’t have a sportsbook section, so you won&#8217;t be able to wager on this site.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for great crypto sports betting platforms, check out our list of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">best Bitcoin betting sites</a>, perfect for most sports betting fans.</p>
<h2><b>What Software Does mBit Use?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
mBit Casino offers games from 44 providers, which is a significant number. The number of elite names in the mix is decent, and it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Betsoft</li>
<li>Red Tiger</li>
<li>Hacksaw Gaming</li>
<li>Yggdrasil</li>
<li>Pragmatic Play</li>
<li>Play’n GO</li>
<li>BGaming</li>
<li>Evolution</li>
<li>Nolimit City</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are no NetEnt, Relax Gaming, Thunderkick, Microgaming, and Playtech games. This is a bummer, especially for NetEnt, since the provider is a fan favorite. Thankfully, the number and diversity of available releases should be more than enough.</p>
<h2><b>mBit Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-139418 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783514-mbit-deposits-and-withdrawals.png" alt="mBit payment methods" width="900" height="466" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783514-mbit-deposits-and-withdrawals.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783514-mbit-deposits-and-withdrawals-300x155.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783514-mbit-deposits-and-withdrawals-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701783514-mbit-deposits-and-withdrawals-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>mBit is a crypto-exclusive casino supporting seven major cryptocurrencies you can use for deposits and withdrawals. Moreover, the site promises instant deposits and cashouts, so expect only to wait for the crypto network to process each of your payments. However, if you want to withdraw sums higher than 1 BTC, mBit might initiate additional verification checks, so the cashout process could take a while.</p>
<p>The accepted cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Tether (USDT). Be careful about which one you use, as you can’t exchange them through mBit.</p>
<p>Also, the site imposes restrictions regarding which games you can play with which crypto. There’s a list of supported providers for every coin in the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<h2><b>mBit Interface &amp; User Experience</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
mBit offers a modern, sleek site design with smooth, intuitive navigation. Nothing is hard to find, and you’ll love the neatly organized game library and Promotions page.</p>
<p>Games have clear-cut categories based on the title&#8217;s type or a specific aspect. You can also filter out releases by their provider and see the RTP value on each game, which is a great bonus, making it easy to find releases that reward more. There’s also a Search function that lets you look for both games and providers.</p>
<h2><b>Does mBit Have a Mobile App?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
No, mBit Casino didn’t have an app at the time of writing. A friendly customer support agent confirmed this to me. However, the site is fully mobile-optimized, so you can use it on your phone through a browser.</p>
<p>The mobile site works well, and users have not noticed any lags or bugs on the site or in the games themselves. Even live dealers function well as long as your connection is stable.</p>
<h2><b>mBit Security</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Even though mBit reviews suggest that the casino is trusted and legitimate, we still need to dig deeper. Thankfully, from everything that I’ve seen, those reviews were correct.</p>
<p>The platform is an established player in the industry, one of the first crypto casinos on the market, as it was created in 2014.</p>
<p>The site also uses standard 128-bit SSL technology to secure data and funds. You can also enable 2FA to further protect your account from a breach.</p>
<h2><b>mBit Pros &amp; Cons </b></h2>

<h2><b>Verdict</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After reaching the end of this comprehensive mBit review, all that’s left is to give a final verdict. mBit casino is modern, filled with various casino games of almost all types, and offers a wide range of promotions to make your experience more exciting.</p>
<p>It has a few issues, like slightly higher wagering requirements with limited time to fulfill them, and a few providers are missing from the mix. However, none of that should detract from the otherwise excellent experience mBit can provide to both casual and high-stakes players.</p>

<p>Debuted in 2018, Fairspin has ranked among the newest crypto casinos, swiftly gaining traction in several major iGaming markets. One glance at its features and services is enough to understand why. The platform has an elegant design. It is licensed, regulated, and packed with high-quality games and top sports betting options.</p>
<p>However, these qualities are just the tip of the iceberg. If you&#8217;re curious about what lies underneath, delve into the Fairspin Casino review ahead. We&#8217;ll explore the brand&#8217;s history, entertainment offerings, promotional value, and advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Fairspin Casino?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137632 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262463-image1-42.jpg" alt="Fairspin Casino’s games selection" width="900" height="467" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262463-image1-42.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262463-image1-42-300x156.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262463-image1-42-768x399.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Fairspin is the only iGaming platform operating under the Curacao-licensed Techcore Holding B.V. As such, the site had a difficult launch in an oversaturated and highly competitive market. The fact that its debut coincided with the onset of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-winter-froze-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-newcomer-orbeon-protocol-orbn-hot-december-2022.htm">crypto winter that froze BTC, ETH</a>, and many other popular tokens didn&#8217;t help, either. Fortunately, its user-friendly website and extensive game collection proved strong enough to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>Today, Fairspin boasts an impressive user base across dozens of countries. It hosts 5,000+ casino games, excellent live and virtual sports betting options, and exciting tournaments. Complemented with hefty promotions and a native utility token (TFS), it’s arguably one of<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoin-casino-sites.htm"> the best altcoin gambling platforms</a> out there.</p>

<h2><strong>Fairspin Casino Bonuses &amp; Promos</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Fairspins doesn’t feature the longest lineup of bonuses and promotions. However, it still offers solid promotional value for the most active players. Depending on when you join, you should be able to claim a match deposit welcome package and tokenized rakebacks.</p>
<h3><strong>Fairspin Casino Welcome Bonus Offers</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137633 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262555-image3-21.jpg" alt="Fairspin’s Promotions &amp; bonuses" width="900" height="408" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262555-image3-21.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262555-image3-21-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262555-image3-21-768x348.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Fairspin Casino welcome bonus is the most enticing offer at this casino. The 4-part package releases rewards after your first four deposits. Each portion of the bonus features a match deposit and a bundle of free spins. Their value and size depend on the amount you’ve deposited, as shown below.</p>

<p></div></p>
<p>When presented this way, Fairspin’s intro promotion may seem intimidating, but it&#8217;s quite the opposite. Multiple options make promotions accessible to a broader audience, catering to high rollers and players with tight budgets.</p>
<p>There are no extra steps or Fairspin bonus codes to worry about. All you need to do is choose the portion that suits your needs, register an account, and make a deposit. The casino will credit your account right away, allowing you to start playing right away.</p>
<p>The only serious drawback of the Fairspin welcome offer is its high wagering requirement. You’ll need to play through your bonus funds at least 60x within three days to be able to redeem your winnings, which is a challenge even for experienced players.</p>
<h3><strong>Fairspin Casino Shitcodes</strong></h3>
<p>Shitcodes are promo codes online gaming brands post on their social media and community pages to treat loyal followers. As of right now, Fairspin features no such offers, but that may change in the future. We’re sure a platform that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fairspin-top-igaming-option-play-to-earn-staking.htm">emerged as a top iGaming option with play-to-earn and staking</a> won’t miss out on the latest trends in user engagement.</p>
<p>For first access to these rewards, subscribe to Fairspin&#8217;s newsletter, follow the brand on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Telegram, and keep an eye on their blog. You never know what surprises a good Fairspin bonus code might bring your way.</p>
<h3><strong>Existing Customer Promos</strong></h3>
<p>Fairspin doesn’t offer any ongoing promotions outside its VIP program. However, the casino is home to regular exciting tournaments, slot races, Drops &amp; Wins, and many other contest-based promotions.</p>
<p>This is the perfect opportunity to explore, whether you’re a seasoned adventurer or a beginner looking for a practice opportunity. Check out Fairspin Casino Games and Tournament sections to find the latest promos.</p>
<h3><strong>Fairspin Casino Loyalty Program</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137635 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262623-image5-17.jpg" alt="Fairspin loyalty program" width="900" height="361" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262623-image5-17.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262623-image5-17-300x120.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262623-image5-17-768x308.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Fairspin Casino VIP program is based on a multi-tier Play2Earn system. Unlike many of its peers, the brand relies on TFS coins rather than traditional casino credits.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with it, TFS is Fairspin’s native coin that uses <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-blockchain-makes-online-gambling-fair-transparent.htm">blockchain to make gambling fair</a> and give players new earning opportunities. Register and start playing games, and Fairspin will reward your activity with a generous bundle of its native coins. You’ll get a prize regardless of your game taste, winning and losing streaks, and budget.</p>
<p>Your TFS reserves will grant you two sorts of loyalty prizes — rakebacks, VIP status cashbacks, and Hold2Earn staking incentives. The casino assesses your ranking every 365 days, meaning you’ll have to be patient if you want to reap all the benefits. Thankfully, the rakebacks are instant, so you’ll get some gratification right away.</p>
<h2><strong>Fairspin Casino Bonus Promo Codes</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are no valid promo codes you can use to get a Fairspin bonus right now. However, that hasn’t always been the case. When you read Fairspin Casino reviews and user feedback online, you’ll see this platform occasionally offers such codes. So, it’s worth checking its newsletter and social media pages. The codes look like short sequences of letters and numbers, making them easy to spot.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can always speak with customer support. The friendly agents will provide you with any Fairspi promo code available and guide you through using it.</p>
<h3><strong>Fairspin Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes</strong></h3>
<p>Fairspin Casino doesn&#8217;t offer deposit bonus codes at the moment. However, you can use the method we discussed above to hunt for them on and outside the official site.</p>
<h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Fairspin Casino?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Fairspin games collection is this platform’s standout feature. It counts over 5,000 titles sorted into more than six categories. The RNG-powered releases are readily available on the sidebar, while the Live Casino section sits at the footer.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the former category is slightly more numerous and diverse, but the latter doesn’t lag far behind. Both are easy to browse thanks to the Provider, Popularity, and Type filters and search engine.</p>
<h3><strong>Slots</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137636 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262711-image8-12.jpg" alt="Fairspin’s slot selection" width="900" height="438" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262711-image8-12.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262711-image8-12-300x146.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262711-image8-12-768x374.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262711-image8-12-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262711-image8-12-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262711-image8-12-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>When it comes to quantity and variety, slots steal the spotlight at Fairspin Casino. The site hosts thousands of releases from 99 software providers. The titles are grouped according to their launch date, prize value, tournament involvement, and many other features. Whether you’re into traditional 5&#215;3 grid games or modern, feature-packed titles, you’ll find something you like. A few of our favorites include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted Dead or a Wild by Hacksaw Gaming</li>
<li>Gonzo’s Quest Megaways by NetEnt</li>
<li>Lion Gems: Hold and Win by Playson</li>
<li>Bonanza Billion by BGaming</li>
<li>Gold Rush Express by Microgaming</li>
</ul>
<p>Those unsure what to pick can rely on Fairspin’s slot toggles — Stats and Play Demo. Use the first to learn about the games’ RTP and biggest win and the second to test the gameplay for free. Together, they’ll help you narrow your choices and find the perfect slot.</p>
<h3><strong>Roulette</strong></h3>
<p>Roulette comes second in popularity after slots, so it’s the only classic table game with a dedicated section. There are 46 titles from around 20 developers, covering a wide range of variations. For those who prefer classics, Spinomenal and Betsoft&#8217;s European Roulette are great places to start. If you&#8217;re looking for something with a twist, explore options like Russian Roulette Basic, Three Wheel Roulette, and Triple Jackpot Roulette.</p>
<p>These RNG-based games also offer a Play Demo mode, allowing you to test the game before giving real bets a try. It’s a fantastic opportunity for beginners to learn about the game, build a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/unitedstates/nevada/lasvegas/fdrs_feat_87_5.html?pagewanted=1">casino strategy</a>, and hone their skills.</p>
<h3><strong>Card Games</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137637 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262769-image2-26.jpg" alt="Fairspin card game selection" width="900" height="427" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262769-image2-26.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262769-image2-26-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262769-image2-26-768x364.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262769-image2-26-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262769-image2-26-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262769-image2-26-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Fairspin’s Card Games category features the other three Vegas casino classics — poker, blackjack, and baccarat. They add up to around 120 titles, a number that hardly comes up to scratch with some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best crypto &amp; Bitcoin casinos</a> today.  Moreover, you cannot sort games by type using filters. You need to remember specific titles when using search engines to find what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Thankfully, neither of these disadvantages affects the games’ quality. You’ll enjoy an entertaining gaming experience, whatever release you choose. Our tip is to start with the basics and work your way up to maximize your rewards. Any of the following titles will work well for this approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>European Blackjack by Betsoft</li>
<li>Premier Blackjack With Side Bets by Microgaming</li>
<li>Baccarat by Nucleus</li>
<li>Baccarat Zero Commission by Habanero</li>
<li>Casino Hold’em by OneTouch</li>
<li>Jacks or Better by Red Rake Gaming</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Live Dealer</strong></h3>
<p>Fairspin currently boasts around 250 live dealer releases, including standard table games and game shows. This is a significant improvement from last year’s 100 title collection, showing the casino keeps upgrading its offerings.</p>
<p>Fairspin’s live titles come from high-profile developers and provide premier user experiences. If you’re into land-based gaming and a competitive atmosphere, this is the perfect place to start your Fairspin adventure.</p>
<p>Our recommendations include Lightning Roulette, Infinite Blackjack, Speed Baccarat, and Casino Hold’em. However, game shows like Monopoly Live, Crazy Time, and Dream Catcher can be just as entertaining.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Games</strong></h3>
<p>Fairspin’s lobby features a range of specialty games. The roster isn’t as extensive as you’d expect, but users can still try their luck at quite a few popular variations. The platform hosts dice, bingo, lottery, keno, scratch cards, and more. Unfortunately, these games are scattered across various categories, so you have to dig to browse them all to find a perfect match.</p>
<h2><strong>Fairspin Casino Sports Betting</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137639 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262832-image6-16.jpg" alt="Fairspin casino sports betting" width="900" height="343" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262832-image6-16.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262832-image6-16-300x114.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262832-image6-16-768x293.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This platform includes a solid online sportsbook. With around 20 sports, the offer can’t compete with the best bookies on the market. Still, it has the upper hand on several of its popular crypto competitors.</p>
<p>In contrast to peers like BC.Game and Fortunejack, Fairspin’s sportsbook wasn’t an afterthought for the brand. Users had access to it from the moment the platform went live. Its features included all the essentials, establishing a decent bettor base from the site’s inception.</p>
<h3><strong>Available Sports &amp; Markets</strong></h3>
<p>As the previous Fairspin review section notes, this vertical covers around 20 sports, including popular and obscure disciplines. Bettors have a chance to wager on all major soccer, basketball, American football, tennis, and similar international events and an impressive selection of eSports.</p>
<p>Even video games like Counter-Strike, Valorant, CoD, and Honor of Kings are available. Meanwhile, there’s a rare section for Politics — a category you’ll only find on a limited number of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-offshore-betting-sites.htm">offshore sports betting sites</a> online. The coverage of smaller, local competitions is weaker, but that’s pretty common among lesser-known bookies.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Fairspin Sportsbook is its user-friendly design. Instead of a cramped lineup, this site organizes its betting options into larger, neat blocks. Each is dedicated to a specific sport and highlights the most popular ongoing and upcoming matches. It also separates all live betting options into a tab you can find at the top of the screen.</p>
<h3><strong>Fairspin Casino Odds</strong></h3>
<p>Fairspin odds are comparable to those of its competitors. You’ll find the best ones if you follow popular sports like soccer or basketball, especially in famous events like the Premier League or NBA. Markets like totals, over/under, and match winners generally provide the best returns. Still, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bet on less popular sports or local competitions. If you spend enough time shopping for odds and researching stats, you’ll have a fair chance at the big bucks with any bet.</p>
<h2><strong>What Software Does Fairspin Casino Use?</strong></h2>

<p>Rather than using in-house software, Fairspin management works with the biggest names in the iGaming development sector. The Games section mentioned the likes of Evolution, Microgaming, Betsoft, NetEnt, Hacksaw, and more. However, it’s worth noting that the collection also includes 3 Oaks, Turbo Games, Lotto Instant Gaming, SmartSoft, and other smaller studios that specialize in niche game categories.</p>
<p>More than 90 companies make up the current roster of providers, but this number fluctuates constantly. The casino continuously seeks new partnerships and collaborations to guarantee an exceptional gaming experience tailored to your preferences.</p>
<h2><strong>Fairspin Casino Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Fairspin Casino supports both fiat and cryptocurrencies, accepting 50 payment methods in total. Being a crypto-oriented casino, it features a lot more blockchain-based options, such as its native TFS token and other well-known coins. Nevertheless, users can make deposits in USD and EUR and then convert them to cryptos if they’re not used to handling decentralized currencies.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the most popular Fairspin Casino deposit options are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, enough users seem to choose the less recognizable tokens for the casino to keep adding them to their list. When it comes to fiat solutions, favorites include Visa, Mastercard, MuchBetter, Piastrix, and more.</p>
<p>The easy payment system and fair terms and conditions give players a lot of choices. There are no limits or fees to worry about. All transactions require minimal effort and are secure, taking from a few minutes to a few days to clear.</p>

<h2><strong>Fairspin Casino Interface &amp; User Experience</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Fairspin’s user-centric approach is among the first things that attracted us to this online casino. The platform’s simple registration process requires little personal information and is easy to complete. You can become a member by syncing your Google, Apple, or MetaMask account or by simply providing your email and username.</p>
<p>The site’s modern design and clear layout keep the experience smooth. The sidebar features the sportsbook, promotions, tournaments, and all vital game categories except live casino. The footer is packed with informative pages, from Terms and Conditions and Responsible Gaming to FAQ and Blog.</p>
<p>The only navigation issue we’ve encountered was the lack of subsections for poker, blackjack, baccarat, and specialty titles, which made finding certain games somewhat challenging.</p>
<h2><strong>Does Fairspin Casino Have a Mobile App?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2023-01-11/the-increased-use-of-mobile-based-gambling-apps-will-propel-the-gambling-market-at-an-11-cagr-by-the-business-research">increased use of mobile gambling apps</a>, Fairspin doesn&#8217;t offer standalone mobile software. Luckily, mobile users can take advantage of Fairspin&#8217;s offerings or services through their mobile browsers. They only need to connect to the internet and load the website on their devices.</p>
<p>The advanced design and games’ HTML5 technology adapt well to small screens, so the site looks much like it does on a desktop device. The primary difference is that the sidebar now sits at the bottom of the screen, and some Info sections are missing from the homepage. However, these changes barely affect navigation.</p>
<h2><strong>Fairspin Casino Security</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137642 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262964-image4-20.jpg" alt="Fairspin licensing and security" width="900" height="384" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262964-image4-20.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262964-image4-20-300x128.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262964-image4-20-768x328.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Although Fairspin operates under a less-known casino company, its security remains strong. The platform holds a valid Curacao license and implements various modern safety protocols. The 128-bit SSL technology encrypts sensitive user info and protects its transactions, while regular audits ensure the company operates fairly and honestly.</p>
<p>Fairspin&#8217;s use of blockchain technology, reliable payment methods, and commitment to industry-standard customer protection policies also play a role in establishing its good reputation. Comprehensive Help Center and round-the-clock customer support only bolster the brand’s standing. All in all, there’s little to complain about in this department.</p>

<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Our exhaustive research and analysis have proved that Fairspin Casino is a favorite for a reason. The site is licensed and regulated, easy to join and play on desktop and mobile, and packed with entertaining games. A customizable welcome bonus, 48 crypto payment methods, and a solid sportsbook round out this package.</p>
<p>The lack of ongoing promotions and high wagering requirements are the only major negatives this Fairspin review identified. However, they do not have to be a dealbreaker for you. Depending on your needs, the site’s rewards program and TFS’s profit potential might be enough to cover your need for promotional value. Visit the site and decide for yourself.</p>

<h2>How to Pick a Fast Payout Casino in the UK</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now that players know more about the best instant withdrawal casinos in the UK, let’s cover some of the key factors to consider when choosing which one to join.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal Speed and Ease</h3>
<p>The first thing to think about when choosing a fast withdrawal casino in the UK is just how fast it pays out. All of the casinos we reviewed process withdrawal requests within a few minutes. Actual payment speeds can vary by blockchain, but most tokens take no more than 5-10 minutes to hit players’ wallets once a payment is sent.</p>
<p>Also consider the ease of making a withdrawal. Players should be able to request a withdrawal from their account without having to contact a casino’s support team. The withdrawal minimum should also be low enough that players can access their funds without jumping through hoops.</p>
<h3>Secure Crypto Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</h3>
<p>Crypto payments must be 100% secure when making deposits to a casino or withdrawing funds. Look for casinos that have track records of protecting players’ funds. It’s also a good idea to only play with licensed casino sites, since these follow security protocols required by licensing bodies.</p>
<h3>Low or No Banking Fees</h3>
<p>Many of the fastest payout online casinos in the UK charge no deposit or withdrawal fees. That’s a huge plus since it means that players aren’t paying for a casino just to move their money back and forth.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that players will still have to pay blockchain fees for deposits and withdrawals. Choosing a casino that uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network or gambling with tokens on low-fee networks like Litecoin can help reduce these fees.</p>
<h3>Welcome Bonuses and Ongoing Promotions</h3>
<p>Welcome bonuses can make a big difference in how much players make when joining a crypto casino. Some casinos offer up to 5 BTC to new players—that’s more than $150,000 worth of free cash.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-138135 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365021-mega-dice-promotions.png" alt="Mega Dice Casino Promotions" width="1000" height="448" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365021-mega-dice-promotions.png 1000w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365021-mega-dice-promotions-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365021-mega-dice-promotions-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When comparing bonuses, make sure to check the bonus wagering requirements. Some casinos make it more difficult to cash out bonuses than others.</p>
<p>Players should also check what ongoing promotions a casino offers after the welcome bonus. Reload bonuses, free spins offers, cashback on losses, and VIP programs can all contribute to making a casino much more lucrative for returning players.</p>
<h3>Casino Game Selection</h3>
<p>Of course, the selection of crypto casino games that a platform offers is a huge consideration when choosing the best online casino in the UK for fast payouts. Top casinos offer 3,000+ casino games, with some like Mega Dice offering more than 5,000 games.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-138133 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365015-mega-dice-casino-games.png" alt="Mega Dice Casino Games" width="1000" height="596" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365015-mega-dice-casino-games.png 1000w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365015-mega-dice-casino-games-300x179.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365015-mega-dice-casino-games-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Look for games from top-rated software providers like NetEnt, Evolution, and Pragmatic Play. In addition, check whether a casino offers a wide range of game types, including slots, table games, poker, and live dealer games.</p>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>Players should also compare the user experience at different casinos. The best casinos have easy-to-navigate lobbies and search tools to help players quickly find their favorite games. Casinos should also offer mobile-responsive websites so that it’s easy to gamble on the go using a smartphone.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Play</h3>
<p>Many casinos are responding to tightening UK rules around gambling by allowing players to join anonymously. For example, Mega Dice, Lucky Block, and TG.Casino all enable players to join with no KYC checks or ID verification. Telegram casinos like Mega Dice and TG.Casino don’t even require players to create an account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-138132 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365009-lucky-block-register-with-no-kyc.png" alt="Sign up for Lucky Block with no KYC" width="1000" height="676" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365009-lucky-block-register-with-no-kyc.png 1000w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365009-lucky-block-register-with-no-kyc-300x203.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701365009-lucky-block-register-with-no-kyc-768x519.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Playing anonymously not only helps players avoid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/26/gambling-uk-white-paper-online-casinos">onerous government restrictions</a>, but also ensures they can gamble privately. There’s no chance of their name or information being leaked in a hack.</p>
<h2>How Do Online Casino Payouts Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Online casinos pay out players in several supported currencies. This can include fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, although most of the top instant withdrawal casinos in the UK only support crypto payouts. That’s because crypto payments are faster, cheaper, and more secure.</p>
<p>Players can request a payout from their online casino account. They must specify the wallet address where they want the funds to be sent and the amount they wish to withdraw. Many casinos have minimum and maximum withdrawal limits, so players must select withdrawal amounts within these limits.</p>
<p>Once a player submits a payout request, the casino will process it and initiate the payout. This usually takes no more than a few minutes. Once the casino sends payment, the transaction will be processed on the corresponding blockchain network. Depending on how busy the network is, transactions can take seconds or up to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Once funds reach a player’s wallet, they’re free to do whatever they like with their tokens.</p>
<h2>What’s Considered a Fast Casino Withdrawal Time?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The fastest payout online casino in the UK can get money in a player’s wallet in less than 60 seconds. However, any payout that takes less than 10 minutes is typically considered quite fast.</p>
<p>Players should keep in mind that casinos only control one part of the payout process: how fast the casino itself approves the withdrawal and initiates payment.</p>
<p>The second part of the payout process, transaction processing on the blockchain, is out of the casino’s control. How long this takes depends on how busy the blockchain is. Players can use tokens from <a href="https://alephzero.org/blog/what-is-the-fastest-blockchain-and-why-analysis-of-43-blockchains/">networks like Litecoin or Cardano that are optimised for fast payments</a> if they want to get their crypto faster.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The best instant withdrawal casinos in the UK make it easy for players to get paid out and deliver their funds in less than 10 minutes in most cases. These casinos also offer huge game selections and generous welcome bonuses, making them great places to gamble in the UK.</p>
<p>The overall best paying online casino in the UK today is Mega Dice. Players can join Mega Dice with no KYC through Telegram and bet on more than 5,000 casino games. Mega Dice offers generous bonuses and a VIP program to reward loyal players. When it’s time to get paid out, the casino delivers funds to players in minutes with no hassle.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135998" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763122-image6-15.jpg" alt="Flush Casino’s homepage shows most of what you need to start playing." width="900" height="435" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763122-image6-15.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763122-image6-15-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763122-image6-15-768x371.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763122-image6-15-130x63.jpg 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763122-image6-15-104x50.jpg 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763122-image6-15-83x40.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Flush Casino is an international crypto-gambling platform established in 2021 by King of Clubz B.V. It’s available in every country where online gambling isn’t prohibited, apart from a few specific nations where the casino restricts access. This includes the US, Netherlands, France, Australia, UK, Germany, Austria, and Spain.</p>
<p>The banking system supports nine popular cryptocurrencies for both deposits and withdrawals, all of which you can buy directly on-site. Meanwhile, cashouts are instant across the board, which makes it one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-decentralized-gambling-sites.htm">best decentralized gambling sites</a>.</p>
<p>The casino’s primary markets are Europe and East Asia, evident from the languages it is available in — English, Russian, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and others.</p>
<p>Flush Casino offers more than 5,500+ titles, encompassing almost every casino game type, from slots, jackpots, tables, and live dealers to crash games, video bingo, keno, and scratch cards. Interestingly, Flush Casino offers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-flushcom-runs-hot-with-bitcoin-and-crypto-casino-games-from-35-top-tier-providers.htm">crypto casino games from 35+ top-tier providers</a>, including Betsoft, Evolution, Hacksaw Gaming, NetEnt, Nolimit City, Play’n GO, Red Tiger, and Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>You get to start your journey with a hefty two-tier welcome package of 100% and 150% matched amounts based on the sum you deposit. There’s also a loyalty program and a constant slew of new promotions. The casino even displays old incentives, so you know what to expect in the future if they decide to bring some back.</p>

<h2><b>Flush Casino Bonuses &amp; Promos</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135999" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763190-image4-19.jpg" alt="The Promotions page contains most of the bonuses and promos you can claim, including the deactivated ones. " width="900" height="602" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763190-image4-19.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763190-image4-19-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763190-image4-19-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Flush Casino has a couple of promotions you’ll want to consider. However, there aren’t any reload bonuses besides the ones you get through the VIP club. Interestingly, the operator leaves all expired promos on the site so you can see what they offered in the past.</p>
<p>On top of that, the platform will occasionally send bonuses through your email, so be sure to verify it once you join, even though it’s not a requirement.</p>
<h3><b>Flush Casino Welcome Bonus</b><b> Offers</b></h3>
<p>Like all online casinos, Flush provides a sign-up promo for all newly registered customers. The Flush Casino welcome offer comes in two tiers, depending on how much crypto you deposit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 bonus — 100% match bonus for deposits from $10 to $200</li>
<li>Tier 2 bonus — 150% match bonus for deposits from $200 to $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>To claim the incentive, you only need to make the required deposit. Once you head to the Wallet, the site will prompt you about the bonus, and you can select it if you wish. There’s no Flush Casino bonus code to worry about, only the deposit and confirmation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136000" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763285-image9-9.jpg" alt="When you click the Wallet bonus, you’ll be prompted with a message where you’ll decide whether to claim the welcome offer. " width="589" height="511" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763285-image9-9.jpg 589w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763285-image9-9-300x260.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></p>
<p>Like all deposit promos, these incentives come with wagering requirements and a few other terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 bonus — 30x wagering requirements, $0.1 min bet and $5 max bet</li>
<li>Tier 2 bonus — 35x wagering requirements, $0.2 min bet and $5 max bet</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the increase in the wagering requirements for the bigger bonus. Bear in mind that the average for the industry is around 30x, so 35x is still reasonable. That said, the wagering requirements apply to both the deposited and the bonus amount, so larger deposits might not be worthwhile.</p>
<p>For instance, if you deposit a maximum of $1,000, you’ll get a total of $2,500. With the rollover requirements being 35x, you’ll need to wager a total of $87,500 to unlock the bonus for withdrawal. In this case, it will be easier to complete the requirement by depositing a lower amount or even going for the Tier 1 bonus.</p>
<p>All things considered, Flush is still one of the sites with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casino-bonuses.htm">best Bitcoin casino bonuses</a>, primarily due to the attractive welcome offer and the VIP program.</p>
<h3><b>Flush Casino Shitcodes</b></h3>
<p>Shitcodes are popular promo codes some crypto casinos distribute occasionally and can often lead to lucrative bonuses.</p>
<p>I dug deep to uncover a Flush Casino shitcode, but unfortunately, I couldn’t find one. I also asked the customer service agents to see whether they normally offer them, but they said no. If something changes in the future, I’ll update the section accordingly.</p>
<h3><b>Existing Customer Promos</b></h3>
<p>Flush Casino doesn’t have typical reload offers — only what you get from your VIP level. However, the operator constantly runs promos like Drops and Wins, races or slot tournaments, and giveaways.</p>
<p>You can check the current roster in the Promotions section of the site. Remember that the site often hosts the famous Pragmatic Play’s Drops &amp;Wins scheme that boasts a monthly prize pool worth €2 million.</p>
<h3><b>Flush Casino VIP Program</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136001" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763384-image2-25.jpg" alt="The VIP Club can be found in your Account section. " width="900" height="487" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763384-image2-25.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763384-image2-25-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763384-image2-25-768x416.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Flush Casino’s VIP Club operates like most other loyalty programs, where you need to wager money playing casino games on the site to earn points. The points count toward your status, and each level has a specific number of credits you need to acquire. The higher the rank, the more points it requires.</p>
<p>Unlike some other casinos, Flush is very transparent with its loyalty system. Every $1 wager in a game earns you 10 points, except for titles on the exclusion list. Also, you can earn up to 1,000 points per stake, which means that the maximum wager equals $100.</p>
<p>Levels also have milestones, and reaching a new one will grant you access to better bonuses. To get to the first milestone, you need 50,000 points, which means you’ll have to wager $5,000. Plankton, the next level, requires 100,000 points, that is, a total bet amount of $10,000.</p>
<h2><b>Flush Casino Bonus Codes</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Flush Casino didn&#8217;t require bonus codes when I was compiling this Flush Casino review. However, the customer service agents assured me they would implement this function in the next update.</p>
<p>You can still ask for bonuses via live chat, as the casino is known to send exclusive promos to email addresses. It won’t contain a Flush Casino promo code, but you can still claim the offer through the link in the email.</p>
<p>If you’re still interested in crypto promo codes, you can always check other crypto gaming platforms, like the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best Bitcoin casinos</a> available today.</p>
<h3><b>Flush Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes</b></h3>
<p>Flush Casino does not offer a no-deposit bonus code, either. The site doesn’t currently feature no-deposit bonuses at all. If circumstances change, expect to see an update to this section.</p>
<h2><b>What Games Can You Play at Flush Casino?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Flush Casino&#8217;s game library is, without a doubt, its most attractive feature. It contains over 5,500 unique releases, predominantly from top-rated providers. Almost all game types are represented, even video bingo and dice games, both rare on other sites.</p>
<p>The only downside is that the platform lacks categories and filters for finding different game types. You can only browse through the Search function or use existing tabs. Thankfully, you can filter out releases from specific providers, which should help you discover interesting titles.</p>
<h3><b>Slots</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136002" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763447-image8-11.jpg" alt="The slot section boasts thousands of releases from more than 30 providers. " width="900" height="642" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763447-image8-11.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763447-image8-11-300x214.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763447-image8-11-768x548.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Being the biggest game category at Flush Casino, slots have their own section where you can easily browse releases, filter titles from specific providers, and find the most popular and newest games.</p>
<p>Here, you’ll have access to many famous and rare video slots, classic slots, and even jackpots, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sweet Bonanza</b> — Top-rated candy-themed video slot from Pragmatic Play with high volatility and a 21,100x max win</li>
<li><b>Mental </b>— Nolimit City slot with over 108 paylines, high volatility, and a 66,666x max win</li>
<li><b>Wanted Dead or a Wild </b>— A 96.38% RTP slot from Hacksaw Gaming boasting many bonus features</li>
<li><b>Gates of Olympus</b> — Popular release from Pragmatic Play, using the rewarding Win All Ways paying mechanism and constant multipliers</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are countless other exciting slot games to try, including Money Train 3, Sugar Rush, The Dog House, Starlight Princess, Stormforged, Blood Suckers, Elvis Frog in Vegas, and Legacy of Dead. Such a diverse gaming library makes Flush Casino one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-slots-sites.htm">best crypto slot sites</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Roulette</b></h3>
<p>Even though there’s no separate section for these games, Flush Casino is still one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-roulette-sites.htm">best Bitcoin roulette sites</a> on the market for the sheer number and quality of roulette releases.</p>
<p>You’ll find both RNG and live roulette games using the Search function. The latter category is also included within the Live Casino section.</p>
<p>All three roulette variations are available — American, European, and French roulette. The games come from many providers, including Pragmatic Play, Evolution, and Playtech.</p>
<h3><b>Blackjack</b></h3>
<p>Roulette and blackjack are in the same boat. You get both RNG and live blackjack games. Meanwhile, there’s no specific blackjack games section beyond what is available through the Search option and Live Casino.</p>
<p>However, the number of blackjack games doubles that of roulette releases. Moreover, you’ll get plenty of exciting variations, including Flush Casino’s original Blackjack game, Classic Blackjack from Red Tiger, One Blackjack from Pragmatic Play Live, and Lucky Lucky Blackjack from Playtech.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, it’s only natural for Flush to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-blackjack-sites.htm">best Bitcoin blackjack sites</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Poker</b></h3>
<p>Typically, there are few poker games to choose from at online casinos, but Flush has still ensured players get more than enough standard and video poker variations to try.</p>
<p>As you can guess, the site doesn’t feature a separate poker games section, which seems to be a running theme here. You’ll once again have to use the Search function, especially for video poker releases, as they are almost impossible to locate otherwise.</p>
<p>When it comes to regular poker games, you’ll find both RNG and live releases. There are 20+ unique titles, including Caribbean Poker, Oasis Poker, Poker Room, and Texas Hold’em Bonus Poker.</p>
<p>As for video poker, you’ll get 30+ games, including more popular variations like Joker Poker, Double Double Bonus Poker, Bonus Poker, and Aces and Eights.</p>
<p>With all this diversity and quality in play, Flush always finds a place among the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-poker-sites.htm">best Bitcoin poker sites</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Live Dealer Games</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136003" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763506-image7-13.jpg" alt="The Live Casino section of the library is quite big, featuring various live dealer games. " width="900" height="622" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763506-image7-13.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763506-image7-13-300x207.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700763506-image7-13-768x531.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Flush Casino has a separate section for live casino games and one for game shows, which is a nice change of pace from what I’ve covered above.</p>
<p>The Live Casino tab has several hundred releases, including roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and poker games, which comprise the bulk of the section. You’ll also find other table and card games like craps, Sic Bo, Andar Bahar, and Teen Patti.</p>
<p>As for game shows, Flush has around 20 of them, including popular Evolution releases like Cash or Crash, Dream Catcher, Football Studio, Side Bet City, and Mega Ball.</p>
<h3><b>Other </b><b>Flush Casino Games</b></h3>
<p>We&#8217;ll quickly review the rest of the game types on offer at Flush Casino:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Flush Originals</b> — Flush has a selection of 13 original games of various kinds, including Dice, Crash, Mines, Plinko, Limbo, Keno, and Diamond Poker.</li>
<li><b>Crash titles </b>— You’ll get only a few crash releases at Flush, and from what I&#8217;ve seen, they usually appear in the Originals section.</li>
<li><b>Baccarat </b>— Flush Casino has a good selection of RNG and live baccarat options. You’ll even get Flush Casino’s proprietary Baccarat game.</li>
<li><b>Craps </b>— I’ve found four craps games on Flush Casino, including Craps from Betsoft and Play’n GO, and Live Craps and First Person Craps from Evolution.</li>
<li><b>Dice </b>— Besides craps, Flush Casino has a few dozen more dice-based games. You&#8217;ll have to search for them manually since they don&#8217;t have their own section.</li>
<li><b>Bingo and video bingo </b>— Flush has several bingo and video bingo releases like Arabian Bingo, Bingo Vikings, Castle Bingo, Immortal Romance Video Bingo, and Viking Runecraft Bingo.</li>
<li><b>Scratch cards</b> — You can play some scratch card games at Flush Casino, including those from Games Global, BGaming, Hacksaw Gaming, and Playtech.</li>
<li><b>Keno </b>— I’ve come across seven keno releases on Flush, including the site’s original game, Keno, and a few others, like Powerball Keno, Classic Keno, and Captain Keno.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Flush Casino Sports Betting</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Flush Casino is just that, a casino. Unlike some other crypto gaming sites that have a sports betting section, Flush Casino does not offer this service. It focuses solely on casino games, including both RNG and live ones.</p>

<p>The platform supports nine cryptocurrencies, all major coins, most notably Bitcoin and altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tether.</p>
<p>There’s no difference between Flush Casino deposit options and withdrawal methods, as the same nine coins are used for both. Both deposits and withdrawals are instant, no matter the coin, making Flush one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-instant-withdrawal-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best instant withdrawal Bitcoin casinos</a>.</p>

Flush Casino has a modern and minimalist design with a fairly standard layout we’ve come to expect from crypto casinos. You’ll feel at home on this site, whether you’re accessing it through your computer or mobile phone.</p>
<p>All games work well, including more demanding ones like live dealer titles. I haven’t noticed any significant bugs or lags while testing the site, so you shouldn&#8217;t run into issues if you have a reasonably strong desktop or mobile device with a stable internet connection.</p>
<p>The only problem with Flush is its poorly organized game library, despite the site featuring more than 5,500 games of almost every type. Even though there are plenty of jackpots, scratch cards, video poker, bingo, and many other releases, many have no separate sections on the site, making them difficult to locate. Thankfully, the Search function can help you find games of a certain type.</p>
<h2><b>Does Flush Casino Have a Mobile App?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Flush Casino doesn’t have a mobile app, but its mobile site is of high quality. It works well on most phones, and everything adapts nicely to fit the smaller screens. You shouldn’t have any problems running most games if you have a modern mobile phone.</p>

The casino is very transparent about what it does with your sensitive information and how it takes care of it.</p>
<p>Most users&#8217; Flush Casino reviews show that the casino is fair and reputable. There’s hardly any negative feedback on sites like Trustpilot, with the majority of ratings being very positive.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the site is filled to the brim with games from the most renowned providers on the scene. Thus, you can trust the casino to be a reliable and trustworthy partner on your gambling journey.</p>

<h2><b>The Verdict</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Flush Casino is a high-quality crypto casino with more than 5,500 casino games from 35+ elite providers. You’ll find almost all casino game types on the site, even though the library isn’t well-organized. Most reputable and top-rated providers are present, which is a massive plus.</p>
<p>While making this long Flush Casino review, I’ve found that the site uses nine major cryptocurrencies as banking options, allows you to purchase them on-site, and offers responsive and helpful 24/7 customer support. With only a handful of downsides, like the lack of recurring bonuses and high wagering requirements, you’ll find primarily positives on this site. All in all, Flush Casino is definitely worth your time and crypto funds.</p>

<h3>6. Metaspins &#8211; 100% Matched Bonus up to 1 BTC</h3>
<p>Metaspins has a deceptively standard welcome bonus of 100% matched up to 1BTC &#8211; until you look at it. This bonus has one of the lowest wagering reqirements of 25x.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88910/235409/metaspins-casino.jpg" alt="Metaspins rakeback rewards" /></figure>
<p>After the welcome bonus, players can earn points towards Metaspins loyalty program. This program has multiple levels that offer anywhere from 15% to 60% cashback on losses. 60% cashback is a huge amount, so we think Metaspins has one of the best loyalty programs for returning players of any Bitcoin casino.<br />

<p>Punt Casino offers more than 200 games to try, including slots from software providers like Dragon Gaming, Reevo, and Spribe. This leading<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-slots-sites.htm"> crypto slots site</a> also offers video poker and table games like blackjack and roulette. There are no live casino games at Punt Casino.<br />

<li>Although the following provider didn&#8217;t make it on our top list, read our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trustdice-promo-codes-review.htm">TrustDice bonus codes and review</a> today.</li>

<h2>Types of Crypto Casino Welcome Bonuses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There are several common types of Bitcoin casino bonuses, each with their own advantages. Here, we’ll take a closer look at the different types of crypto casino bonuses and where players can find them.</p>
<h3>Deposit Match Bonuses</h3>
<p>Deposit match bonuses are by far the most common type of Bitcoin casino free bonuses available today. With a deposit bonus, the amount of bonus a player earns is proportional to the size of their deposit, up to a maximum bonus amount. Deposit match bonuses require that players make a deposit, unlike a Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Here are the best Bitcoin deposit match bonus offers for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/"><strong>BC.Game</strong></a> &#8211; Earn up to $220,000 over 4 deposits</li>
<li><a href="https://cloudbet.com/en/bitcoin-bonus?af_token=ae4254b0cbbf0760d3442112d77a6748&amp;aftm_campaign=cryptonews"><strong>Cloudbet </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 5 BTC with a 100% match</li>
<li><a href="https://refpa4903566.top///L?tag=b_1671237m_3425c_&amp;site=1671237&amp;ad=3425"><strong>1xBit </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 7 BTC over 4 deposits</li>
<li><a href="https://betflip.io/?refId=630f9b2a574c3d8d53f10986"><strong>BetFlip </strong></a>&#8211; Earn up to 5 BTC over 4 deposits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Free Spins Bonuses</h3>
<p>Free spins bonus offers give players free plays on a casino’s slot machines. They offer a fun way to try out popular slot games, and players have a chance to win big without risking any of their own money. The more free spins, the more chances a player has to win.</p>
<p>Some of the best free spins bonuses can be found at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mBit </strong>&#8211; Earn 300 free spins after first deposit</li>
<li><strong>Winz.io </strong>&#8211; Earn 300 free spins with no wagering requirement</li>
<li><strong>FortuneJack </strong>&#8211; Earn 250 free spins after first deposit</li>
<li><strong>Hell Spin </strong>&#8211; Earn 100 free spins with every reload</li>
</ul>
<h3>No Deposit Bonuses</h3>
<p>A Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus is a coveted type of bonus that can’t be found very often. In fact, none of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm"><u>Bitcoin casinos</u></a> we reviewed currently offer a Bitcoin casino no deposit bonus in 2023 for USA players.</p>
<p>A no deposit bonus gives a player free cash or free spins just for creating a casino account. There’s no deposit required and a player can start using the bonus funds right away to start playing slots and other casino games. If the player runs out of bonus funds, they can either make a deposit to keep playing or simply switch to a new casino.</p>
<p>Bitcoin casino USA no deposit bonus offers tend to be much smaller than deposit match bonuses when they can be found. For example, a $100 USA crypto casino no deposit bonus would be considered very large, while deposit match bonuses can exceed $100,000 in value.</p>
<h3>Reload Bonuses</h3>
<p>Reload bonuses are bonus offers targeted at returning players. They provide an incentive for players to make another deposit to their account after they’ve already played through the casino’s welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Reload bonuses can be quite generous. Here are some of the best offers for returning players:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hell Spin</strong> &#8211; 50% match up to $200 + 100 free spins</li>
<li><strong>Betflip </strong>&#8211; 100% match up to $1,500 on weekends</li>
<li><strong>BetOnline </strong>&#8211; 35% match up to $35</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loyalty Bonuses</h3>
<p>Some casinos also offer loyalty bonuses for returning players. These are distinct from reload bonuses because they don’t necessarily require players to make a new deposit. Instead, they offer players rewards based on the amount they’ve wagered or the frequency with which they visit a casino.</p>
<p>Some popular loyalty bonuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1xBit</strong> &#8211; Promo code store for points-based promotions</li>
<li><strong>Thunderpick</strong> &#8211; Surprise bonus offers for returning players</li>
<li><strong>Metaspins </strong>&#8211; Earn up to 60% cashback on losses</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bitcoin Casino Bonus Codes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm"><u>Bitcoin gambling sites</u></a> require bonus codes in order to claim a welcome bonus or reload bonus. These promo codes are used to ensure that players are getting the latest bonus offer. They can also be used to track referrals or to enable players to choose between several different available bonus offers.</p>
<p>That said, many Bitcoin casinos choose to forgo bonus codes, especially for new players. In that case, a bonus is applied automatically whenever players qualify for it. This helps ensure that players never miss out on a bonus opportunity.</p>
<p>Here are the bonus codes for the best Bitcoin casino bonus offers:<br />

Bitcoin Casino Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions</p>
<p>Bitcoin casino bonuses come with a fair amount of fine print. It’s important to understand the restrictions on bonus offers and how bonus cash can be used. Here are some of the key terms and conditions to know:</p>
<h3>Wager Requirement</h3>
<p>The wager requirement is perhaps the most important condition every player should know about when using Bitcoin casino bonuses. This is the amount, relative to the amount of the bonus, that a player must bet in order to be able to withdraw their bonus funds.</p>
<p>As an example, say a $1,000 bonus has a wager requirement of 40X. That means that in order for the player to withdraw the bonus cash or any winnings earned by betting the bonus money, they must first wager at least $40,000 at the casino.</p>
<h3>Game Restrictions</h3>
<p>Some of the best crypto casino bonuses can be played on any games that a casino offers, but this isn’t usually the case. More frequently, bonus cash can only be used for certain types of games, like slots.</p>
<p>Many casinos restrict bonuses from being used on live dealer games. There may also be specific games or software providers for which bonus funds cannot be used.</p>
<h3>Valid Period</h3>
<p>Bonuses often don’t last forever. Casinos may require that players meet a bonus’s wagering requirement within a certain amount of time, like 30 or 60 days. This means that players have to be strategic about how large a bonus they claim based on how much they think they will wager in the days or weeks after signing up for a new casino site.</p>
<h3>Win Limits</h3>
<p>Some casinos place limits on the amount that players can win when using bonus funds. While this sounds a little underhanded, these limits are usually quite high. They’re mainly intended to prevent players from winning a massive jackpot while betting with bonus funds.<br />

<h2>Top 5 Tips for Using Online Crypto Casino Bonuses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To get the most out of crypto casino bonuses, it helps to have a few tricks. Here are our top tips for playing with crypto casino bonuses.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look for no deposit bonuses. </strong>No deposit casino bonus offers are tough to find, but they appear from time to time. The best USA Bitcoin casino with no deposit bonus lets players try out a casino without risking any of their own funds.</li>
<li><strong>Play eligible games.</strong> Players need to make sure that once they claim a bonus, they’re sticking to games that count towards the wager requirement. Most casinos only offer a limited amount of time to meet the wager requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Bet big.</strong> Bonus funds and free spins are use-it-or-lose-it in most cases. So, it’s worth betting big with a bonus rather than playing carefully and potentially missing out on bonus cash.</li>
<li><strong>Be strategic about reloads.</strong> Players can stretch their money a lot further by being strategic about how and when they deposit money into their account. Many casinos offer extra reload bonuses on specific days of the week.</li>
<li><strong>Loyalty pays off. </strong>While it can be tempting to claim casino bonuses at many different casinos, loyalty has its own rewards. Often, returning players receive surprise bonuses and perks that can be worth a lot of money.</li>

<h2>How Do Ethereum Wallets Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Beginner investors can easily choose the best Ethereum wallet from our list. However, it is imperative to understand how crypto wallets work to trust the allocation of your digital assets to them.</p>
<p>Ethereum wallets provide a secure, efficient and user-friendly mechanism to store ETH, NFTs and other crypto tokens and then later <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-can-you-buy-with-ethereum.htm">buy products with Ethereum</a> if they so wish.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets are not unlike regular cash wallets. They also allow users to digitally hold their assets, the key difference being that crypto assets are not physically stored in the wallet.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are bits of data that are located on a blockchain. The wallets essentially store the user’s proof of ownership of crypto assets.</p>
<p>ETH tokens are stored in Ethereum’s Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). Most Ethereum wallets allow users to generate a new Ethereum account. Traders do not need to use a previously generated Ethereum account.</p>
<p>Users operate their ETH tokens through two cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key. </p>
<p><strong>Public Key</strong>: A public key can be intuitively visualized as a bank account number. Users can transfer ETH tokens from to others using their public key. Public keys are named so because users can publicly distribute this key to receive crypto assets from others.</p>
<p><strong>Private Key</strong>: A private key is an alpha-numeric passcode that proves a user’s ownership of an Ethereum account. Every Ethereum EOA has an associated private key. As the name suggests, a private key needs to be protected at all costs. </p>
<p>If a malicious actor gets hold of the key, they can easily claim possession of all the crypto assets associated with it. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, in most cases, users cannot even recover their accounts.</p>
<p>A private key has another important use. Ethereum uses a user’s private key to cryptographically generate a digital signature. This digital signature is used to sign all outgoing crypto transactions. A malicious actor can use the private key to forge transactions.</p>
<p>A wallet is primarily responsible for protecting this private key. Furthermore, a wallet can also generate multiple public keys. A public key is cryptographically derived from a private key. While the public key can be distributed, it can be used to track certain details about a user such as transaction history and account balance. Therefore, modern wallets generate a new public key after every transaction to protect a user’s privacy.</p>
<p>A crypto wallet uses a seed phrase to authenticate the user’s ownership of the wallet. Therefore, it is imperative that users protect their seed phrases from ever being stolen. Users can also choose to store the phrase at multiple locations for surety. </p>
<h2>Types of Ethereum Wallet</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While all wallets generally perform the same set of functions, there can be several key differences between them. A beginner user needs to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to choose the best Ethereum wallet.</p>
<p>Based on the mode of availability, wallets are generally categorized into three categories: software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. </p>
<h3>Software Wallet</h3>
<p>A software wallet is an application that allows users to store their crypto assets by digitally securing their private keys.</p>
<p>A software wallet’s best feature is its accessibility. Users can access these applications on commonly used devices such as Android and iOS phones, personal computers and even web browsers. They do not require the purchase of any new equipment or device.</p>
<p>Software wallets are commonly referred to as hot wallets. While those terms may be used interchangeably, a hot wallet is technically referred to as any wallet that is connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Software wallets being connected to the internet results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. Software wallets allow users to quickly purchase and sell crypto assets using their private keys. The<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm"> best crypto apps</a> can also often support a wider range of crypto tokens and provide seamless transactions. Furthermore, they provide a range of payment options such as credit/debit cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay and PayPal.</p>
<p>While software wallets provide a bevy of advantages, they are considered less secure than hardware wallets. The connectivity to the internet can allow hackers and other malicious actors to gain access to a user’s private key.</p>
<p>A software wallet can be further categorized into three categories: mobile wallets, desktop wallets and web wallets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Wallet</strong>: As the name suggests, mobile wallets are applications that users can run on their Android or iOS platforms. Best Ethereum wallets such as Best Wallet offer these applications on both Google Play Store and Apple app store.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Wallet</strong>: Desktop wallets are wallet interfaces that users can download on their personal computers. Desktop applications store the private key on the computer’s local storage. </li>
<li><strong>Web Wallet</strong>: Web wallets are one of the most popular kinds of software wallets. Users can usually search for these wallet services on the internet and add them as a web browser extension. While these wallets provide extremely user-friendly interfaces, they are considered the least secure. They can be subjected to keylogger hacks and distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardware Wallets</h3>
<p>Hardware wallets are considered one of the most secure forms of crypto storage. These wallets are physical pieces of equipment that secure the private-public key pair. Users need to connect the equipment to a device such as a personal computer to operate the wallet.</p>
<p>An Ethereum hardware wallet is also referred to as a cold wallet. Cold wallets are defined as any crypto storage device that does not connect to the internet. The lack of internet connection ensures that malicious actors cannot steal the confidential information of the users. Software wallets are as secure as the platform they are operating on while hardware wallets provide additional multiple layers of security for users.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/guide/112160/271173/regularguy-eth-afdtdwyxfd.jpg" alt="Crypto coins and a ledger wallet" /></figure>
<p>Hardware wallets can also provide additional security features. For example, modern cold wallets use security features such as a PIN code or a biometric scan that makes it impossible for a malicious actor to access the crypto tokens. Hardware wallets are also coming up with additional technology to replace seed phrases, thus eliminating the single point of failure.</p>
<p>While hardware wallets are secure, they also have some key disadvantages. Most importantly, hardware wallets are considered to be less user-friendly than software wallets. These wallets need to be connected to another device such as a desktop to operate.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are also considered significantly more expensive than software wallets &#8211; the price of a hardware wallet can usually range between $50 &#8211; $300 and can be a deal breaker for several users. </p>
<h3>Paper Wallets</h3>
<p>Ethereum paper wallet involves crypto asset holders writing down their private-public key pair on a piece of paper. This is an old method of storage that is rarely used with the advent of modern crypto wallet technology.</p>
<p>Paper wallets are a kind of cold wallet. However, unlike hardware wallets, they are considered unreliable and risky. Users with paper wallets require an interface to access the blockchain. Therefore, they often end up depending upon exchanges or software wallets, negating any advantage of cold storage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, paper wallets are a massive single point of failure risk. The private key can be lost, stolen or destroyed, making it impossible for the user to ever access their crypto assets. </p>
<h2>How to Find Safe Ethereum Wallets?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The primary function of an Ethereum wallet is to secure a user’s private key and the crypto assets allocated to it. </p>
<p>Investors, especially those just entering into crypto investment are always keen to know if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-cryptocurrency-safe.htm">cryptocurrency is safe to invest in</a> and wallets are a necessary feature of participating in the space. However, there are several factors that a user can consider to choose the most secure Ethereum wallet. </p>
<h3>Reputation of the Provider</h3>
<p>Due to the decentralized nature of crypto, scams and rug pulls are one of the biggest threats to the digital assets of a user. </p>
<p>Therefore, considering the reputation of a wallet provider is the easiest step a user can take to trust the authenticity of the wallet.</p>
<p>For example, a wallet that is regulated by a leading regulatory body can generally be trusted. Similarly, providers with a strong track record of traditional financing can also be trusted with their crypto products.</p>
<h3>Security Features</h3>
<p>A good understanding of the various security features offered by crypto wallets can help users select the best wallet.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are usually considered the most secure option. These wallets are not connected to the internet, preventing any malicious activity to access the user’s confidential data. They can also provide additional security features such as biometrics and a PIN code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a software wallet can also be trusted if it provides comprehensive security features.</p>
<h3>Testing the Wallet</h3>
<p>Testing the wallet may be the best way to develop trust. Users can send a small amount of crypto assets using the wallet before trusting it for significant amounts. A number of Ethereum wallets also allow users to try out the wallet on the testnet using fake crypto assets. </p>
<h2>How To Choose The Best Ethereum Wallet For You?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The choice for the best Ethereum wallet is a matter of personal choice and can differ from user to user. Here are the key factors that can help users make an informed choice. </p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>As we have already discussed, a wallet’s primary role is to ensure the security of a user’s crypto assets. Therefore, users need to consider security as their top priority while selecting the Ethereum wallet. Beginners need to choose a wallet that is reputed and is certified by a regulatory body.</p>
<p>Beginners are also susceptible to losing their private keys. Therefore, they need to choose a wallet with proper wallet recovery options such as seed phrase, two-factor authentication. </p>
<p>Remember, it is possible to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-avoid-crypto-taxes.htm">avoid paying tax on crypto</a> if you simply keep it in your wallet and don&#8217;t sell it, but you want peace of mind that it will still be there when you return.</p>
<h3>Supported Coins </h3>
<p>Beginners can be overwhelmed by the wide variety of assets available in the crypto market. A high-quality wallet supports a large number of crypto tokens, thus allowing users to diversify their portfolios.</p>
<p>Many top wallets are also universal in nature as they support more than one blockchain network.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Another important factor to consider is the fees required to purchase certain crypto assets through a wallet. Different wallets use different exchanges to allow users to purchase crypto tokens from the wallet interface. Hardware wallets can often partner with third-party services to offer crypto functionality to users.</p>
<p>Fees can be of various types such as processing fees, network fees, trading fees, withdrawal fees, etc. Hardware wallets also require users to purchase the device upfront which can be expensive.</p>
<h3>User-Friendliness</h3>
<p>Beginners need to consider that the wallet they choose is user-friendly. The idea of user-friendliness can differ from user to user. Beginner users may prioritize the ability to operate their Ethereum wallets from their mobile phones. Proper customer support and a broad ecosystem can also make wallets like Best Wallet user-friendly.</p>
<p>Most importantly, wallets must provide users with a clear user interface to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies. </p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Users may prioritize the availability of certain features in their wallets. For example, NFT enthusiasts may prioritize that the wallet provides NFT support. Seasoned investors may require staking, farming and yield functionality in their wallets. </p>
<h3>Type of Wallet and Mobile Availability</h3>
<p>Users need to make a careful choice between hardware wallets and software wallets. Most beginners prefer the availability of mobile wallets. Therefore, they need to ensure that the wallet of their choice provides Android or iOS support.</p>
<p>Seasoned investors may choose a multi-layered approach that involves both hot wallets and cold wallets. Such users usually store their assets in cold storage and transfer them to a hot wallet when they are looking to trade. </p>
<h2>How to Get &amp; Use A Ethereum Wallet &#8211; Step-by-Step</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>By now, a user has enough information to choose the best Ethereum wallet of their liking. Now, let’s go over how users can operate an Ethereum wallet seamlessly. We are taking the example of the Best Wallet due to its simplistic user interface.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Downloading the App</h3>
<p>To start, visit the Play Store (for Android users) or the App Store (for iOS users). Search for &#8220;Best Wallet&#8221; and tap the ‘download’ icon. The Best Wallet app is free and designed for a quick installation process.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Account Registration</h3>
<p>After the installation, the app will guide you through the registration process. You have two options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter an email address that you frequently use.</li>
<li>Use the &#8216;Continue with Apple/Google&#8217; feature for a seamless integration with an email already associated with your device.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Enhancing Security</h3>
<p>For your account&#8217;s protection:</p>
<ul>
<li>The app offers two-factor authentication (2FA). This will send a six-digit code to your device whenever you log in, adding an extra layer of security.</li>
<li>Setting up a four-digit PIN is essential and cannot be skipped.</li>
<li>For those preferring quick access, you can activate a fingerprint login. This means no more PIN entries whenever you want to access your account.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Explore The Best Wallet Features</h3>
<p>Once registered, you can explore all the Best Wallet features. This includes insights on emerging and popular tokens, purchasing cryptos via third-party applications, and trading on its decentralized exchange platform with vast cryptos.</p>

<h2>Vave Casino Sports Betting</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Vave Casino is one of the best new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">Bitcoin betting sites</a> thanks to its more than 36 sports markets and support for live betting. Our Vave Casino review will take a closer look at this sportsbook. </p>
<h3>Available Sports &amp; Markets Markets</h3>

<p>Bettors at Vave Casino can also wager on special events like the World Cup and the Olympics. The sportsbook also takes bets on some non-sporting events like the stock market and politics.</p>
<h3>Vave Casino Odds</h3>
<p>Vave Casino’s sports betting odds are fairly competitive, although not the best we’ve seen. The sportsbook doesn’t report what services it uses to generate odds or whether it generates odds in-house. For most matches, we found that Vave Casino’s odds are in line with other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-decentralized-gambling-sites.htm">decentralized gambling sites</a>. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/97547/242509/vave-sports-betting.jpg" alt="Football Game Odds On Vave Casino" /></figure>
<p>However, in less-watched sports, Vave Casino’s odds can be slightly less favorable than average. The plus side is that bettors will find many events to wager on that aren’t available at other sportsbooks.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best crypto casinos</a> work with more than 100 game studios, so this is a relatively limited selection. However, we didn’t feel like the player experience at Vave Casino suffered for it.</p>

<p>Vave Casino accepts 8 popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Ripple, and Tron. The casino also uses Changelly and Onramper to accept Visa and Mastercard credit/debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.</p>

<p>ArbDoge AI is a popular meme coin built for the Arbitrum network. The project’s $AIDOGE token offers staking, access to lottery prize drawings, and more. </p>
<p>$AIDOGE rocketed 2,500% after it launched in mid-April, but the token is now down 85% from its all-time high. So, is now the right time to buy $AIDOGE? We’ll take a closer look and explain <strong>how to buy ArbDoge AI</strong>.</p>
<h2>How to Buy ArbDoge AI in 4 Quick Steps</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>ArbDoge AI’s $AIDOGE token is available to buy through the centralized exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">OKX</a>. Here’s how to buy $AIDOGE:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">Sign up for OKX</a>. Visit the OKX exchange and register a new account.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Buy $USDT. Use OKX’s Express Buy module to purchase $USDT with a credit card, debit card, bank transfer, or another fiat payment method.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Find $AIDOGE/$USDT. Open the OKX trading terminal and find the $AIDOGE/$USDT spot trading pair.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Buy $AIDOGE. Enter a market order with the amount of $USDT to spend, then click ‘Buy’ to purchase $AIDOGE.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ArbDoge AI: An Overview</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>ArbDoge AI is a meme coin based on the popular shiba inu meme—the same meme that launched Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and hundreds of other meme projects.</p>
<p>ArbDoge AI is built on Arbitrum, a Layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum. ArbDoge AI describes itself as an ‘experiment’ on Arbitrum and is still under development. The development team is anonymous, which is not uncommon for meme coins.</p>
<p>The ArbDoge AI ecosystem includes two separate, but related coins: $AIDOGE and $AICODE.</p>
<p>$AIDOGE is the project’s primary token. It’s available to buy and sell on OKX and Uniswap. $AIDOGE supports staking and is highly deflationary, offering an opportunity for price appreciation.</p>
<p>$AICODE is a governance and revenue sharing token. The only ways to get $AICODE are to burn $AIDOGE or purchase at least $500 worth of $AIDOGE in a single transaction. $AICODE token holders receive a portion of revenue from the sale of ArbDoge AI NFTs.</p>
<h3>ArbDoge AI Tokenomics</h3>
<p>The ArbDoge AI project has a total supply of 21 quadrillion $AIDOGE tokens.</p>
<p>Before ArbDoge AI launched, the project held a series of 20 airdrops to distribute 100% of the $AIDOGE supply for free. Anyone who qualified for Arbitrum’s $ARB airdrop also qualified for the $AIDOGE airdrop. Individuals who invited friends to $AIDOGE earned additional tokens.</p>
<p>$AIDOGE is designed to be deflationary. To date, 9.993% of the total $AIDOGE supply (nearly 21 trillion tokens) has been burned.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314795/aidoge-burn.jpg" alt="$AIDoge Burn Statistics" /></figure>
<p>Every transaction involving $AIDOGE incurs an 8% tax. The taxed $AIDOGE is used for several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1% of $AIDOGE tokens are burned, contributing to deflation</li>
<li>0.7% of $AIDOGE tokens are added to a staking pool</li>
<li>3% of $AIDOGE tokens are converted to $ARB, then given away to Lucky Drop prize winners</li>
<li>1% of $AIDOGE tokens are recycled to the Camelot DEX to provide liquidity</li>
<li>0.8% of $AIDOGE tokens are converted to $ARB and distributed to $AICODE token holders</li>
<li>1.5% of $AIDOGE tokens are reserved for the ArbDoge AI treasury</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314791/arbdoge-ai-tokenomics.jpg" alt="Arbdoge AI Tokenomics Allocation" /></figure>
<p>$AICODE has a maximum supply of 1.025 million tokens. There are only two ways to get $AICODE:</p>
<p>By burning $AIDOGE (unlocks 60% of $AICODE supply)</p>
<p>By purchasing $AIDOGE in transactions of at least $500 (unlocks 40% of $AICODE supply)</p>
<p>The amount of $AICODE released by these actions is determined according to a schedule. $AICODE is set to be fully mined in 10 years.</p>
<h2>Why Buy ArbDoge AI?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are several reasons why investors may want to consider buying $AIDOGE.</p>
<h3>Deflationary Price Potential</h3>
<p>ArbDoge AI is a deflationary project, meaning that supply of $AIDOGE will decrease over time. So, if demand stays consistent or rises moderately, the price of $AIDOGE could shoot higher.</p>
<h3>Meme Potential</h3>
<p>Investors may also be interested in $AIDOGE because it is a meme coin. Meme coins have been hot lately, with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meme-coin-cryptocurrencies/"><u>several projects posting 10x or greater returns</u></a>. $AIDOGE itself generated a 2,500% return after launching, although it has since fallen significantly from its all-time high.</p>
<p>Meme coins have been known to shoot upwards on positive news, so speculative investors could buy $AIDOGE in the hope that it will rise sharply in price in the future.</p>
<h3>Staking Income</h3>
<p>Token holders can stake their $AIDOGE tokens to the Arbitrum network and earn additional $AIDOGE tokens. The project sets aside 0.7% of $AIDOGE from each transaction for staking rewards. So, the more transactions involving $AIDOGE, the more tokens are available for staking rewards.</p>
<h3>Revenue Sharing</h3>
<p>Investors can buy or burn $AIDOGE in order to mine $AICODE. That is valuable because $AICODE token holders are entitled to part of the tax from every $AIDOGE transaction. $AICODE token holders also receive a share of revenue from the sale of ArbDoge AI NFTs.</p>
<h3>Lucky Drop Entry</h3>
<p>Every time investors buy at least $100 worth of $AIDOGE, they receive entries into ArbDoge AI’s Lucky Drop giveaway. Lucky Drop drawings take place every 30 minutes and reward the winner with $ARB prizes (derived from the tax on $AIDOGE transactions).</p>
<h2>How to Buy ArbDoge AI: Detailed Step-by-step</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors can buy ArbDoge AI on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">OKX</a> following these steps:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Sign Up for OKX</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">Visit OKX</a> and click ‘Sign Up’ to register a new account. Enter an email or phone number, then enter the verification code that the exchange sends.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314790/sign-up-for-okx.jpg" alt="Create OKX Account" /></figure>
<p>OKX follows Know Your Customer requirements, so new investors must provide their name, address, and a copy of their driver’s license or passport to complete the registration process.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Buy $USDT</h3>
<p>In the OKX menu, find ‘Buy Crypto’ and then select ‘Express Buy.’ Enter the amount of money to deposit in USD and select $USDT (Tether) as the cryptocurrency to buy. Click ‘Buy USDT’ and then enter payment information to complete the transaction.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314788/buy-usdt-on-okx.jpg" alt="Buy USDT With USD" /></figure>
<h3>Step 3: Find $AIDOGE/$USDT Pair</h3>
<p>Select ‘Trade’ in the OKX menu and then choose ‘Spot’ under ‘Basic Trading.’ This will open the OKX trading terminal. On the left-hand side, search for $AIDOGE and select the $AIDOGE/$USDT spot trading pair.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314786/search-arbdoge-aion-okx.jpg" alt="AIDOGE/USDT Trading Pair" /></figure>
<h3>Step 4: Buy $AIDOGE</h3>
<p>Under the price chart, select ‘Market’ to enter a new trade. Enter the amount of $USDT to convert and OKX will automatically calculate the amount of $AIDOGE this will buy. When the trade is ready, click ‘Buy’ to purchase $AIDOGE.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314787/buy-arbdoge-ai-on-okx.jpg" alt="$AIDOGE Market Order" /></p>
<h2>Is ArbDoge AI a Good Buy Now?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>AbrDoge AI has experienced the explosive up and then down pattern that has become characteristic of meme coins.</p>
<p>After launching in mid-April, $AIDOGE rocketed 2,500% in a few weeks. The token hit a high of $0.00000000105 and saw more than $470 million in trading volume <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbdoge-ai/"><u>according to CoinMarketCap</u></a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314793/arbdoge-ai-price.jpg" alt="$AIDOGE Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>However, shortly after hitting its all-time high, $AIDOGE fell nearly 85%. Today, the coin is trading at $0.000000000155, only slightly above the token’s ICO price. Daily trading volume is less than $10 million.</p>
<p>For investors looking to pick up $AIDOGE on the cheap, this could be good news. The token certainly has room to run if it’s going to make a move back to its high in the future.</p>
<p>However, there are also reasons to be wary of $AIDOGE. The reduced trading volume in $AIDOGE means that less tax is being collected. That in turn means there is less $AIDOGE for staking and Lucky Drop rewards. The rate of $AIDOGE burning has also decreased, slowing the token’s deflationary trend.</p>
<p>It’s possible that $AIDOGE will see an uptick in interest as a result of new developments. The team behind this project is working on introducing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as well as DeFi applications. News about either of these developments could send $AIDOGE higher.</p>
<p>However, our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbdoge-ai-price-prediction-as-aidoge-blasts-up-5-are-whales-buying.htm"><u>$AIDOGE price prediction</u></a> suggests that the token has entered a period of stagnant price action. $AIDOGE has support at its current price level, and there is little to suggest that it could make a strong upward move in the absence of news.</p>
<h2>AiDoge: A Fast-growing Alternative to ArbDoge AI</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Investors interested in ArbDoge AI may also want to check out AiDoge ($AI). This is another shiba inu-themed meme coin that has no relation to $AIDOGE, despite the similarity in naming.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/118006/314794/aidoge-homepage.jpg" alt="AIDoge Crypto Presale" /></figure>
<p>AiDoge is a memester’s dream. The project team is developing a generative AI algorithm that can create new memes in seconds based on a prompt. It will create both an original image and original text to go with it.</p>
<p>Users can mint their new memes as NFTs with just a click. So, it’s easy to keep track of who owns AiDoge-generated memes that go viral.</p>
<p>In order to create memes, users will need AiDoge’s $AI token. This is an ERC-20 token that users can spend to purchase meme generation credits. Alternatively, token holders can stake $AI to earn daily credits to generate new memes.</p>
<p>AiDoge allows the community to vote on their favorite memes, and top memesters are rewarded with additional $AI. So, there’s a built-in incentive for meme creators to be as clever as possible with the help of AiDoge’s AI algorithm.</p>
<p>AiDoge recently launched on MEXC and Uniswap after raising $14.9 million during its presale. $AI jumped 680% after launch, but has since fallen and has a lower market cap than $AIDOGE. So, investors still have a chance to buy $AI before it really takes off.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>ArbDoge AI is a Arbitrum-based meme coin that offers staking, revenue sharing, appreciation potential, and more. The $AIDOGE token is available to buy on OKX as well as through decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>ArbDoge AI has been in a rut lately, so investors may want to explore alternative meme coins like AiDoge. While this has a similar name to ArbDoge AI’s token, AiDoge is an independent project for generating memes that’s now trading on MEXC and Uniswap.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What exchanges support $AIDOGE trading?</strong></p>
<p>$AIDOGE is available to buy on the centralized exchange OKX. It’s also available on LBank, CoinW, and BitMart, as well as several decentralized exchanges including Uniswap and Camelot.</p>
<p><strong>Should I buy $AIDOGE?</strong></p>
<p>ArbDoge AI’s $AIDOGE token offers opportunities for staking and can be burned to get $AICODE, which offers passive income through a revenue share. However, our price prediction indicates that $AIDOGE may trade at a low price for some time to come. Investors may want to check out an alternative meme token with more price appreciation potential, such as $AI.</p>

<p>BC.Game has made a splash as one of the biggest and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best online casinos</a> in 2023. This casino offers more than 8,000 games along with a full-fledged online sportsbook. BC.Game accepts more than 150 cryptocurrencies and fiat payment methods, plus it’s available to US players.</p>
<p>In our <strong>BC.Game review</strong>, we’ll cover BC.Game bonuses, games, payments, and everything else players need to know about this top gambling site.</p>
<h2>What is BC.Game?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/">BC.Game</a> is an online casino and sportsbook launched in 2017. The casino now offers more than 8,000 games, while the sportsbook offers betting on more than 80 sports markets.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238088/bc-game-lobby.jpg" alt="bc.game casino homepage" /></figure>
<p>BC.Game has grown rapidly in recent years becoming one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">best Bitcoin gambling sites</a> on the market. When it first launched, the casino had barely more than a dozen games and a relatively small following. Today, BC.Game boasts more than 3 million players from 150+ countries at its casino and sportsbook.</p>

<h2>BC.Game Bonuses &amp; Promos</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BC.Game offers a huge variety of bonuses for new and returning players &#8211; including a massive $220,000 welcome bonus at the casino. Our BC.Game review will highlight all the BC.Game bonus codes players can take advantage of today.</p>
<h3>BC.Game Welcome Bonus Offers</h3>
<p>BC.Game offers one of the biggest welcome bonuses of any online casino we’ve seen. New players at the casino can claim up to $220,000 in BCD (1 BCD is equivalent to $1) over their first 4 deposits.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238092/bc-game-welcome-bonus.jpg" alt="bc.game casino four matched deposit bonuses" /></figure>
<p>This matching deposit bonus is variable, such that the more players deposit, the higher the match percentage for which they qualify. Here are the maximum bonuses for each of the 4 deposits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st deposit: </strong>270% match up to 20,000 BCD</li>
<li><strong>2nd deposit: </strong>300% match up to 40,000 BCD</li>
<li><strong>3rd deposit: </strong>330% match up to 60,000 BCD</li>
<li><strong>4th deposit: </strong>360% match up to 100,000 BCD</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus BCD is unlocked as players wager at a rate of 2.5% of the wager. That comes out to a 400X overall wagering requirement, which is quite steep compared to other top Bitcoin casinos. At this time, there is no BC.Game bonus code for the platform’s sportsbook.</p>
<h3>BC.Game Shitcodes</h3>
<p>BC.Game shitcodes are limited-time promotions that players can use to earn free crypto at the casino. The best way to get the current BC.Game shitcode for 2023 is to follow the casino on <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/L5YyYla7--Arsls3DgAgdw">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/bcgameofficial">Twitter</a>. The casino also has a <a href="https://forum.bc.game/">community forum</a> where the casino posts current BC.Game shitcodes.</p>
<h3>Existing Customer Promos</h3>
<p>BC.Game offers several different promotions for existing customers. One of these is a medals system. Medals can be earned through wagering, engaging with other players on the BC.Game community forum, and more. When players earn a certain number of medals, they earn a bonus:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 Medals unlocks 20 BCD</li>
<li>10 Medals unlocks 800 BCD</li>
<li>15 Medals unlocks 2,400 BCD</li>
<li>20 Medals unlocks 10,000 BCD</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also the BC.Game Task Hub, which offers daily tasks that players can complete to earn BCD rewards. The tasks are usually simple and fun, like playing a specific game or engaging with the BC.Game community. Another ongoing promotion is BC.Game’s bonus wheel. Players can spin this once a day for a chance to win some bonus crypto &#8211; up to a maximum prize of 1 BTC.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238085/bc-game-bonus-spin.jpg" alt="bc.game free spins" /></figure>
<p>There’s also hide-and-seek with Coco, the BC.Game mascot. Players who click on Coco before when it appears &#8211; and before it disappears &#8211; earn some bonus BCD.</p>
<h3>BC.Game Loyalty Program</h3>
<p>On top of the everyday bonuses for returning players, BC.Game has a couple special bonuses for the casino’s most loyal players. Bonuses and VIP features are unlocked as players earn higher VIP status levels. VIP levels are achieved by wagering on BC.Game casino games and engaging with the community forum.</p>
<p>At VIP Level 3, players can join the Roll Competition. This is a daily chance to earn Dogecoin in a fun dice game. At Level 4, players get access to a secret treasure chest with bonuses inside, and at Level 5 players become eligible for random crypto giveaways to active members of the community forum. </p>
<p>Other benefits to being a BC.Game VIP include:</p>

<li>Rakeback of up to 20% on wagering losses</li>
<li>Fee-free withdrawals every day</li>

<p>The highest-tier VIPs earn Super VIP (SVIP) status. SVIPs receive access to even bigger rewards. For example, the secret treasure chest could contain an all-expenses-paid vacation or huge crypto token rewards. SVIPs also gain access to BC.Game’s annual exclusive in-person party for the casino’s top players.</p>
<h2>BC.Game Bonus Promo Codes</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There is no BC.Game promo code required to claim the casino’s marquee welcome bonus. However, BC.Game bonus codes can unlock extra bonuses that players can use to start betting and winning.</p>

<h2>BC.Game Sports Betting</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BC.Game offers sports betting on more than 80 markets. While the platform is a relative newcomer to the world of sports wagering, BC.Game has quickly made a name for itself as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">best Bitcoin betting sites</a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238090/bc-game-sportsbook.jpg" alt="bc.game sports betting homepage" /></figure>
<h3>Available Sports &amp; Markets Markets</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bcgame-sportsbook-all-you-need-know-about-new-feature.htm">BC.Game sportsbook</a> takes wagers on more than 80 sports markets around the world. Some of the sports available for wagering include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Motorsports</li>
</ul>
<p>BC.Games also offers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-esports-betting-sites.htm">esports betting</a> and has a partnership with Cloud9, one of the world’s largest esports companies. The sportsbook accepts live bets on ongoing games for most sports markets. There is a wide range of betting options, including prop bets, over/under bets, and parlays.</p>
<h3>BC.Game Odds</h3>
<p>BC.Game offers fairly competitive odds for most matches, although it rarely has the most favorable odds for any given match-up. The range of sports markets and bet options make up for average odds, however, and BC.Game’s betting experience is pretty seamless.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238086/bc-game-live-betting.jpg" alt="bc.game sports markets" /></figure>
<p>Two betting features help BC.Game’s sportsbook stand out. The first is quick bet, which lets players place bets in seconds with just a few taps or clicks. The second is a wager dashboard, which makes it easy for bettors to see all of their open wagers. Together, these two features make it very easy for players to manage their bets across multiple markets.</p>

<h2>What Software Does BC.Game Use?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BC.Game works with a whopping 58 software providers to power its casino. Many of the providers are world-renowned gaming studios that are also used by many of BC.Game’s top competitors. Some of the biggest-name software providers players will find at BC.Game include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Tiger</li>
<li>Evolution Gaming</li>
<li>Endorphina</li>
<li>Betsoft</li>
<li>Habanero</li>
<li>PlaynGo</li>
<li>Pragmatic Play</li>
<li>Wazdan</li>
</ul>
<p>When searching for games to try on BC.Game, players can filter by provider, making it easy to explore all the games from a top studio.</p>
<h2>BC.Game Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>One of the features that users frequently cite in BC.Game reviews is the ease of payments at this casino. </p>
<p>For crypto payments, BC.Game accepts more than 150 popular crypto tokens fee-free. It&#8217;s no wonder that BC.Game is also one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-monero-casinos.htm">best Monero casino sites</a> on the market. That includes all the biggest tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Ripple, plus some of the most popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-emerging-cryptos.htm">emerging cryptocurrencies</a>. BC.Game has its own in-app crypto wallet, making it incredibly simple to move crypto into and out of a user account.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238097/bc-game-deposits.jpg" alt="bc.game withdraw btc" /></figure>
<p>For fiat payments, BC.Game accepts a more limited selection of currencies, including USD. Players can make fiat deposits by credit or debit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay. There is no minimum deposit at BC.Game, which is another plus. Minimum withdrawal amounts vary by cryptocurrency, but the limits are generally quite fair. Expect to pay a fee of around 0.1% per crypto withdrawal, although the exact fee varies by token. VIPs receive one free withdrawal per day.</p>
<p>Withdrawals are processed right away and typically hit a user’s crypto wallet within 30 minutes.</p>
<h2>BC.Game Interface &amp; User Experience</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>BC.Game’s user experience is seamless compared to other online gambling sites we’ve tried. The casino and sportsbook are separated, making it easy for players to focus on the type of gambling that most appeals to them at any moment.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238096/bc-game-user-experience-1.jpg" alt="bc.game casino leading slots " /></figure>
<p>At the casino, players will find a list of game types in a straightforward menu. Within each game type, titles can be sorted alphabetically, by popularity, or by software provider. Every game offers a practice play mode so that players can learn how a game works before betting real money on it. Another thing we like about BC.Game’s interface is that VIPs can access their benefits right from the main menu. Players can access task-based promotions or the bonus wheel in a single click to start earning bonus cash.</p>
<p>The sportsbook is similarly well-organized. In the lobby, players will find a selection of live and upcoming matches to wager on. A more detailed menu displays the most popular sports available at BC.Game followed by an A-Z list of all the sports available for wagering. The bet slip is always just a click away, making it simple to place new bets quickly before a game starts.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that BC.Game offers 24/7 live chat support. Representatives usually respond to questions within a few minutes, making this a great resource when players need help.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/"><strong>Visit BC.Game Today</strong></a></p>
<h2>Does BC.Game Have a Mobile App?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>No online casino can make it far these days without a mobile app, and BC.Game is no exception. The BC.Game app is available for iOS and Android and offers access to all of the platform’s games and betting markets.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/95503/238098/bc-game-mobile-app-1.jpg" alt="bc.game mobile app homepage" /></figure>
<p>In the BC.Game app, players will find mobile-friendly versions of all of BC.Game’s casino games. It’s also simple to set up sports wagers with a few taps. Of course, players can also manage deposits and withdrawals through the BC.Game app and access 24/7 live chat support.</p>
<p>We found the app to be seamless to use, even on a smartphone that doesn’t have a lot of screen real estate. Navigating the casino and sportsbook lobbies is just as easy as on a computer, and the quality of the mobile adaptations is second to none.</p>
<h2>BC.Game Security</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en"><u>Coinbase</u></a> is the most popular crypto app in the US and one of the best crypto apps for beginners. The app makes it incredibly simple to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Just sign up, add funds with a credit card, debit card, or bank transfer, and buy crypto.</p>
<p>The catch to this simplicity is that Coinbase charges higher fees than many other top crypto exchanges, especially for card purchases. Users are charged 1.49% when making purchases with a bank transfer or 3.99% when using a credit or debit card.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88214/222147/coinbase-app.jpg" alt="Coinbase mobile app" /></figure>
<p>When trading cryptos under $200, Coinbase charges a fixed sum. The fee ranges from $0.99 &#8211; $2.99 per transaction, depending on the trading amount. Above $200, Coinbase charges a percentage-based fee. The fee starts from 0.40% per transaction.</p>
<p>The great thing about the Coinbase app, though, is that investors have access to an enormous range of altcoins. Coinbase currently lists more than 9,600 crypto assets, including many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm"><u>meme coins</u></a> and relatively unheard of coins that haven’t yet broken out. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">New cryptos</a> are being added to the Coinbase app on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very user-friendly app</li>
<li>Accepts credit and debit cards</li>
<li>9,600+ tokens to trade</li>
<li>Advanced charting and analysis tools</li>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/en"><u>Kraken</u></a> is another popular crypto exchange that caters to both first-time crypto investors and experienced traders.

<p>The Kraken app also supports traders by offering in-depth mobile charts. Traders can customize their candlestick charts with dozens of indicators and drawing tools, plus set up price alerts and execute limit and stop orders on the app. Fees for trading with Kraken Pro start at 0.26% per trade, while an instant buy order costs 0.9% for stablecoins and 1.5% for all other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h3>5. Binance &#8211; Crypto App with Lowest Trading Fees</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/"><u>Binance</u></a> app is the best crypto app for users in search of low transaction fees. When using Binance’s trading platform, traders pay a fee of just 0.10% for most transactions. Even better, trading on many Bitcoin-fiat and Bitcoin-stablecoin pairs is free, as are most transactions that use Binance’s own BUSD stablecoin. Traders can also get discounted commissions if they hold BNB, Binance’s native cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The Binance app can be a little difficult to navigate because it packs so many features in. The app offers trading on more than 350 coins, plus a built-in NFT marketplace, tools for decentralized finance (DeFi) like staking and lending, and even crypto savings accounts.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88214/222144/binance-app.jpg" alt="Binance mobile app" /></figure>

<h2>How to Find the Best Crypto App</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There’s a lot that goes into choosing the best cryptocurrency app. Here are some of the key factors we considered in our reviews.</p>
<h3>Regulation</h3>
<p>Many of the best cryptocurrency apps are regulated, providing customers with assurances that they follow market rules and have measures in place to keep users’ funds safe. Most exchanges are part of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and require new users to verify their identity.</p>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>How easy a crypto app is to use can make a big difference in the process of buying and selling digital currencies. The most user-friendly crypto apps offer a simple instant buy/sell interface along with simple tabs for making deposits and withdrawals or accessing analysis tools. If an app offers an advanced charting platform, it should be straightforward to customize the charts with a few taps.</p>
<h3>Tradable Cryptos</h3>
<p>The range of tokens available to trade is a major factor when deciding on the best cryptocurrency app. Some apps only offer a handful of the most popular cryptocurrencies, while others offer hundreds or even thousands of altcoins. It’s also a good idea to check what tokens are available for crypto staking.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Trading fees can vary widely between crypto apps and even for different coins and payment methods on the same app. The best crypto apps typically charge a fee of 1% or less to buy and sell Bitcoin. Watch out for credit and debit card fees, which can significantly increase the cost of trading.</p>
<h3>Tools &amp; Features</h3>
<p>The trading tools available in a crypto app can also be very important. Some apps offer advanced technical charts, price alerts, order management tools, and more. Other helpful features include social trading and a crypto market news feed. </p>
<p>A growing number of crypto apps also offer crypto staking and lending, which is key for investors who want to participate in DeFi. Some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">best crypto mining sites</a> also allow users to mine BTC and other PoW coins via a proprietary Android and iOS app. </p>
<h3>Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Nearly all crypto apps accept deposits by bank transfer or crypto transfer, and many accept debit and credit cards as well. However, there may be steep deposit fees when paying with a card. Some crypto apps also allow payments using e-wallets like Google Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, Neteller, and Skrill.</p>
<h3>Customer Support</h3>
<p>Many crypto apps offer 247 customer support, which is important since the crypto market itself is active 24/7. Check whether there’s in-app chat support or phone support for faster service.</p>
<h2>What is the Best Crypto App for Staking &amp; Interest?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto staking enables investors to stake their tokens to a blockchain and earn interest as a reward. Crypto staking can yield double-digit interest rates on some crypto apps and can be an important way for investors to make money from their tokens.</p>
<p>We think the best crypto apps for staking in 2023 are AQRU and Crypto.com. AQRU enables investors to earn up to 3% APY interest on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC with no lock-in period. For investors who are willing to lock their USDC for 90 days, rates jump to 8% APY. AQRU makes it easy to start staking with just a credit or debit card and charges a flat commission of 0.35%.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/88214/222143/aqru-app.jpg" alt="Crypto trading mobile app" /></figure>
<p>Crypto.com offers staking on more than 40 different cryptocurrencies with interest rates up to 14.5% APY. Bitcoin earns up to 5% APY and Ethereum up to 6% APY. The app offers flexible staking periods as well as 1-month and 3-month lock-in periods. Note that to get the best interest rates, users must also stake CRO, Crypto.com’s native cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>The Best Cryptocurrency Wallet App</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Many of the top crypto apps we reviewed offer built-in custodial wallets. Users who buy crypto from these exchanges can leave their coins in their exchange account and don’t have to transfer them to a separate wallet app.</p>
<p>However, there are advantages to using a standalone crypto wallet app. It can be more secure and ensures that users have total control over their tokens.</p>
<p>The best crypto wallet app in 2023 is the eToro Money app. This crypto wallet app supports dozens of popular cryptocurrencies, including all of the coins available from eToro. It integrates directly with the eToro exchange to facilitate swapping between crypto pairs, but it can also be used to store crypto purchased with another crypto app.</p>

Duelbits is a trustworthy gambling site that’s fully licensed in Curacao. The <a href="https://crustlab.com/blog/curacao-gaming-license-casino-regulations/">Curacao Gaming Control Board recently introduced new regulations</a> for licensed online casinos to make them even safer for players.</p>
<p>Duelbits goes above and beyond the security measures that other online casinos take. It doesn’t require KYC information, so players don’t have to worry about their personal information being leaked or stolen. In addition, players can activate 2-factor authentication in order to safeguard their Duelbits accounts against malicious actors.</p>
<p>The casino has never suffered a major hack or loss of players’ funds since it launched in 2020. That’s a big deal since <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/99643-online-gaming-a-sure-bet-for-hackers">online casinos have increasingly come under attack by hackers</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its instant payouts, sizeable welcome bonus, and weekly 10% cashback, Betplay seems like an attractive choice for casino players. On top of that, it’s crypto-exclusive and features a dedicated sportsbook.</p>
<p>To check the quality of these features and analyze everything else the platform has to offer, we’ve made this detailed Betplay review. Keep reading to learn everything there is to know about Betplay, from its bonuses and promotions to its games and banking sector.</p>
<h2><b>What Is Betplay?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betplay is a relatively new crypto-exclusive online casino and sports betting platform. Operated by Lama Tech, Limitada, a company registered in Costa Rica, Betplay began operations in 2020. It currently operates without a license, which is not unusual for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">crypto gambling sites</a>.</p>
<p>The site is fully international and available to players of age in most countries where gambling is legal. Betplay fully adheres to the no-KYC doctrine, being featured on Notokyc.com. It doesn’t require any personal information, enabling you to gamble anonymously. That’s why it’s one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-anonymous-casinos.htm">best anonymous casinos</a> that don’t require KYC verifications.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="436" class="aligncenter wp-image-129807 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699626665-betplay-homepage.png" alt="Betplay crypto casino" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699626665-betplay-homepage.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699626665-betplay-homepage-300x145.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699626665-betplay-homepage-768x372.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699626665-betplay-homepage-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699626665-betplay-homepage-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699626665-betplay-homepage-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>From what I can see, there are thousands of Betplay games — I stopped counting at around 2,000. Most of the games in this library are slots, but it also contains many table games, provably fair titles, live dealers, and even a dedicated poker section with constant tournaments. You can also find a dedicated sportsbook with good coverage of most major sports.</p>
<p>Being crypto-exclusive, Betplay lets its users make deposits and withdrawals in several supported cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Tether, Dogecoin, and more. You can even buy crypto straight from the site.</p>
<p>Like all <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">crypto and Bitcoin casinos</a>, Betplay features several promotions, including a welcome package, rakeback and cashback reload offers, and a VIP club. However, the site has plans to add more soon.</p>

<h2><b>Betplay Bonuses &amp; Promos</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betplay doesn’t feature a lot of promotions, but the ones it does have are pretty good, especially the loyalty program, which leads to a daily rakeback and weekly 10% cashback. As always, there’s a welcome bonus available to all new players who’ve just made their account and initial deposit.</p>
<h3><b>Betplay Welcome Bonus</b><b> Offers</b></h3>
<p>Betplay offers a 100% welcome deposit bonus of up to 50,000 u₿ (micro-bitcoin or μBTC). 50,000 μBTC equals 50 mBTC, which is the same as 0.05 BTC. You can also claim it with any of the other 12 supported coins, each with a specific maximum amount.</p>
<p>There are no specific deposit minimums besides what the site stipulates, and you don’t have to use a Betplay bonus code. Just register and make your initial deposit within the first seven days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="388" class="aligncenter wp-image-129814 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627202-betplay-deposit-bonus.png" alt="Betplay deposit bonus" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627202-betplay-deposit-bonus.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627202-betplay-deposit-bonus-300x129.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627202-betplay-deposit-bonus-768x331.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the sign-up offer comes with a high wagering requirement of 80x, so it’s best to claim the bonus with smaller amounts. For instance, if you deposit 5,000 μBTC (equal to 0.005 BTC), you’ll get a total of 10,000 μBTC in your balance, while you’ll have to wager as much as 400,000 μBTC (0.4 BTC) to complete the requirements. The good news is you get plenty of time for that — 30 days.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for lower wagering requirements, it’s best to check our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metaspins-review.htm">Metaspins review</a>, as its welcome offer has a low 25x rollover.</p>
<h3><b>Betplay Shitcodes</b></h3>
<p>Shitcodes are a type of promo code that crypto casinos offer occasionally, usually on their socials. They unlock various prizes like free spins and free bets. BC.Game is known to do that, as you can see in our detailed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bc-game-review.htm">BC.Game review</a>.</p>
<p>However, Betplay doesn’t support the use of shitcodes and doesn’t offer them at all. Most of the promotions on this site operate without a Betplay promo code.</p>
<h3><b>Existing Customer Promos</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="435" class="aligncenter wp-image-129815 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627258-betplay-promos.png" alt="Betplay rakeback and cashback" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627258-betplay-promos.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627258-betplay-promos-300x145.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627258-betplay-promos-768x371.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627258-betplay-promos-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627258-betplay-promos-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627258-betplay-promos-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Betplay doesn’t have many promotions for existing players. There are a few primarily focused on the VIP program. Specifically, they depend on your VIP level, which we’ll cover in the next section of our Betplay review.</p>
<p>The good news is that both of these are rewarding and don’t require much of you, which is why we count Betplay promos among the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casino-bonuses.htm">best Bitcoin casino bonuses</a>. Here’s an overview of what you get here:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Daily Rakeback</b> — A rakeback is a bonus you get on your wagers. In essence, Betplay pays you back a percentage of the amount you wagered in the past day. The bonus is paid automatically, and there’s nothing you need to do to get it. You only need to wager real money; the more you stake, the more will be returned.</li>
<li><b>10% Weekly Cashback </b>— The weekly cashback is a standard cashback offer that covers 10% of your losses incurred on casino games but not from sports betting. The cashback is paid automatically every Thursday, and the percentage covered varies based on factors like game type, size of the stake, and even your VIP level. The higher your level, the bigger the weekly cashback.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that the two reload promos are unavailable until you reach the Bronze I level within the VIP program. This is the first level in the scheme, but you don&#8217;t automatically become part of it — you must reach it.</p>
<h3><b>Betplay VIP Program</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="686" class="aligncenter wp-image-129816 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627286-betplay-vip-program.png" alt="Betplay Vip program" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627286-betplay-vip-program.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627286-betplay-vip-program-300x229.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627286-betplay-vip-program-768x585.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Betplay VIP program is tailored to every member of the platform. You&#8217;re not automatically enrolled as you join — you have to start playing to reach the first level. The good news is that the first level unlocks the daily rakeback and weekly cashback promos.</p>
<p>There’s little detail on how the system calculates your XP points to advance you through levels. However, the customer support agents have told me that you only need to play to progress, and the system considers your turnover, not your losses, to calculate the points.</p>
<p>Interestingly, every new level comes with a free spins reward, and you get other perks depending on the tier. These can be crypto cash drops or an increase in your daily rakeback.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of the levels within the program and the rewards and perks you get:</p>
<p><div class="su-table su-table-alternate"></p>

<p>If you’re a big fan of loyalty programs in online casinos, your top choice should be Metaspins. The site has a unique loyalty program with levels that go on forever, and each tier from 5 onwards requires 500 spins to reach. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/metaspins-review.htm">Metaspins review</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Betplay Bonus Codes</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betplay doesn’t currently have a system in place for using promo codes, nor does it distribute them. Once you join, you’ll see that there are no promo code fields in the deposit or bonus areas.</p>
<p>Bonuses on Betplay don&#8217;t require a code, only deposits. Bear in mind that most promos are awarded automatically.</p>
<h3><b>Betplay No Deposit Bonus Codes</b></h3>
<p>Betplay doesn’t currently feature a no deposit bonus. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean the site will stick with this approach forever, so if we see a no deposit bonus on this platform in the future, we’ll update this section.</p>
<h2><b>What Games Can You Play at Betplay Casino?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" width="900" height="717" class="aligncenter wp-image-129819 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627374-betplay-library.png" alt="Betplay super slice game" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627374-betplay-library.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627374-betplay-library-300x239.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627374-betplay-library-768x612.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Betplay casino games are the biggest attraction at this casino. The library is truly massive and very diverse. While reviewing it, I counted over 2,000 titles, but the list goes on, and others claim there are more than 6,000. The selection is also diverse. Slots make up the majority, but the site has most other types of casino games, except for bingo titles.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find what you’re looking for as the platform doesn’t categorize every game type, but it does have categories for slots, table games, poker, live dealers, and more. You can also filter out specific table games, jackpot games, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/provably-fair-every-online-casino-should-want-to-adopt-it-6199.htm">provably fair</a> releases, and slots with the Megaways feature. Plus, there are filters for providers.</p>
<h3><b>Slots</b></h3>
<p>Online slots are the biggest category on Betplay, just as they are in most other casinos. You’ll find a wide range of video and classic slots, including jackpots.</p>
<p>The releases come from several dozen providers, including top-rated names like Hacksaw Gaming, Push Gaming, Nolimit City, BTG, Elk Studios, Microgaming, NetEnt, Red Tiger, and Thunderkick.</p>
<p>Some interesting games you should try are Wanted Dead or a Wild from Hacksaw Gaming, Jammin’ Jars 2 from Push Gaming, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Megaways from BTG, and Midas Golden Touch from Thunderkick.</p>
<h3><b>Roulette</b></h3>
<p>Betplay features over 50 roulette games from providers like Evolution, Microgaming, Relax Gaming, and Ezugi. Moreover, you get both RNG and live dealer roulette releases.</p>
<p>You’ll find a lot of quality titles, including some unique variations like Premier Roulette, Turbo Auto Roulette, Bombay Roulette, and Terminator 2 Roulette.</p>
<h3><b>Blackjack </b></h3>
<p>Betplay holds around 50 RNG and live blackjack games. The selection is diverse and includes games for both casual and pro players.</p>
<p>Some of the more exciting titles you’ll find are Classic Blackjack from OneTouch, American Blackjack from Nucleus, and 3-Hand Blackjack from Habanero.</p>
<h3><b>Poker</b></h3>
<p>Unlike many other casinos, Betplay features a substantial number of poker games. I found more than 30, including standard and video poker variations. The site also holds both RNG and live versions of poker, and it boasts a separate poker area for players interested in poker tournaments.</p>
<p>As for specific games, you’ll find compelling releases like Three Hand Poker, Caribbean Beach Poker, Hold’em Poker, Bet on Poker, Oasis Poker, and Triple Card Poker.</p>
<h3><b>Live Dealer Games</b></h3>
<p>Live dealer games have their own section on Betplay, where you’ll find variations of roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and game shows.</p>
<p>Releases come from several providers, including the leaders in the sphere — Evolution and Ezugi. Moreover, you’ll also find titles from BetGames.TV, Asia Gaming, Microgaming, and Pragmatic Play Live.</p>
<p>Besides being diverse, the live casino is enormous, featuring over 330 games.</p>
<h3><b>Other Games</b></h3>
<p>As I’ve mentioned, Betplay has outdone itself in terms of diversity, as almost all game types are covered. Besides the ones we discussed, you’ll also find video poker, craps, dice, scratch cards, crash games, and keno releases.</p>
<p>These games don&#8217;t have their own categories, so finding them may take some time, although a search bar is available.</p>
<h2><b>Betplay Sports Betting</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Now that you’ve seen a detailed Betplay casino review, it’s time to review the site’s sportsbook section.</p>
<p>It’s well-designed, on par with most online sportsbooks today, except the leading ones. This is expected as Betplay is primarily an online casino.</p>
<p>You pick the odds format you like the most — the three main formats are there, along with Hong Kong odds.</p>
<h3><b>Available Sports &amp; Betting Markets </b></h3>
<p>Betplay features a decent range of sports and competitions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Football </b>— UEFA Champions League, Europa League, Premier League, Bundesliga</li>
<li><b>Basketball </b>— NBA, NCAAB, Euroleague, Adriatic League</li>
<li><b>American football</b> — NFL, NCAAF, CFL</li>
<li><b>Tennis </b>— All four Grand Slams, Challengers</li>
<li><b>Ice hockey</b> — NHL, AHL, OHL, KHL, Liiga</li>
</ul>
<p>Other sports like UFC, boxing, cricket, volleyball, darts, and rugby have fewer leagues and competitions, but you’ll still be able to find something if you’re a fan.</p>

<p>The esports section includes a wide range of games and events. Every day is filled with around a dozen events in games like Counter-Strike, LoL, Dota 2, Rainbow Six, Starcraft 2, Warcraft 3, FIFA, NBA2K, and even less popular games in the esports sphere like Age of Empires 2 and osu!</p>
<p>Betplay lets you place both pre-match and live wagers, including both popular markets and bet types like props and handicaps. This is especially true with football, where games come with hundreds of markets.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about futures, Betplay hasn’t forgotten those, either. It has a separate Outrights section in the betting area where you’ll find all futures listed per sport.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, Betplay certainly deserves a spot among the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">best Bitcoin betting sites</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Betplay Odds</b></h3>
<p>Betplay has decent odds for most sports, with some events, especially those in football, often having more competitive odds than in other sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The situation is more mixed with other sports, which is to be expected for what’s primarily a crypto casino.</p>
<h2><b>What Software Does Betplay Use?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betplay boasts an extensive selection of providers, many of which are elite names in the industry. Here’s a quick look at some of the biggest names whose games are available on Betplay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution</li>
<li>Hacksaw Gaming</li>
<li>Push Gaming</li>
<li>Play’n GO</li>
<li>Pragmatic Play</li>
<li>NetEnt</li>
<li>Nolimit City</li>
<li>ELK Studios</li>
<li>Thunderkick</li>
<li>Quickspin</li>
<li>Microgaming</li>
<li>Red Tiger</li>
<li>Betsoft</li>
<li>BTG</li>
<li>Relax Gaming</li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that the list of providers is different in some countries. Even though you’re not required to provide your country of residence, the site uses geolocation software to determine where you’re from.</p>
<p>US players have the most limitations due to local laws, and US-based players can’t access releases from providers like Betsoft, BTG, Hacksaw Gaming, Microgaming, and NetEnt. On the other hand, UK players have fewer restrictions but can’t access Play’n GO, Pragmatic Play, Thunderkick, and Quickspin games. German players get the best treatment, as they only have a few restrictions, notably Relax Gaming, Play’n GO, and Blueprint.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can use a VPN to change your location and get access to most games. Betplay doesn’t limit the use of VPNs. Because of this and a few other perks, we’ve included it in our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vpn-friendly-casinos.htm">VPN-friendly casinos</a> list.</p>
<h2><b>Betplay Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</b></h2>

<p>Betplay is a crypto-exclusive gaming platform featuring 13 cryptocurrencies, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>You can make both deposits and withdrawals using any of these, and you’re also allowed to buy crypto through the site. The option is available on select coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, USDC, and USDT), and you get to use popular services like MoonPay, Transak, and Banxa.</p>
<p>The site doesn’t have a minimum deposit on any of the supported Betplay deposit options. There’s only a 20 μBTC minimum deposit if you’re using the Lightning Network. However, this is only 0.00002 BTC, less than a dollar.</p>
<p>Lastly, the platform has no withdrawal fees, so you must only pay a gas fee to the blockchain network of the crypto you’re using.</p>

<h2><b>Betplay Interface &amp; User Experience</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
You&#8217;ll immediately notice that Betplay aims for a modern, user-friendly, and minimalist design. In contrast to most online casinos, it has removed the complex registration process and opted for simple email-based account creation. With fast deposits, users can start playing within a few minutes.</p>
<p>The site is well organized, and most things are easy to find. Most of the technical features are in the profile area, while the platform has separate sections for casino games, sports betting, and poker.</p>
<p>The site can be used in several languages, including English, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Finnish.</p>
<p>The only slight downside is the lack of categorization in the library. However, you still get several categories and can filter out games based on the provider.</p>
<h2><b>Does Betplay Have a Mobile App?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Yes, Betplay has an Android and iOS app you can download straight from the official site by visiting it on your phone. If you have an Android device, you’ll see the Android logo for download at the bottom of the sidebar, and you’ll see the iOS logo if you have an iPhone.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="300" height="673" class="aligncenter wp-image-129826 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627890-betplay-mobile.png" alt="Betplay signup tab" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627890-betplay-mobile.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627890-betplay-mobile-134x300.png 134w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The app is high-quality and well-organized, just like the mobile site. It’s very user-friendly and features the same functionalities as the desktop site. You won’t encounter any significant issues as long as you have a decent smartphone and a stable connection.</p>
<h2><b>Betplay Security</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betplay doesn’t currently hold a license, which is often the case with crypto gambling sites. However, it’s still a reputable website, which we can see from various player-made Betplay reviews and seals of approval from BitcoinCasinos.com, CryptoLists.com, and CryptoCasinos.com.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="454" class="aligncenter wp-image-129828 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627917-betplay-security.png" alt="Betplay company information" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627917-betplay-security.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627917-betplay-security-300x151.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699627917-betplay-security-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The site is safe and secure, using the latest security measures like SSL encryption. You also don’t have to worry about your privacy, as Betplay is one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-anonymous-casinos.htm">best anonymous casinos</a> without a KYC or verification requirement.</p>

<p>To help crypto investors find the best crypto interest account for their needs, we’ll take a closer look at the top accounts available today.</p>
<h3>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Best Crypto Interest Account With 500% Dynamic APY And 40% Presale Price Increase </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF)</a> is the best crypto interest account on the market, according to our analysis. </p>
<p>This account presently offers a PoS APY of 500%, an aggressive 25% token burn to encourage price appreciation, and a presale price increase of nearly 40% between the first and final rounds. </p>
<p>These are three powerful incentives that will appeal to any modern investor looking to maximize ROI. But it is the core use case that makes this the top crypto interest account. </p>

<p>This presale is concerned with SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the USA. If this happens, which many analysts expect, it will have major implications for the entire crypto market. As this presale is positioning itself for this precise event, it could benefit by much more than other crypto assets. </p>
<p>As detailed within the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token Whitepaper</a>, the roadmap has five major milestones that are mainly concerned with core market events, such as the SEC approval and the price of Bitcoin hitting $100,000. </p>
<p>So it is a market-orientated campaign as opposed to being a self-contained ecosystem. It aims to thrive along with the market, capitalizing on key events. It also provides a dedicated section on its website &#8211; Latest Bitcoin ETF News &#8211; to aggregate the latest information.</p>
<p>Other essential updates can be found on the Bitcoin ETF Token social media accounts, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Telegram</a>. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130371" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Staking Information" width="900" height="373" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1-300x124.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699877452-screen-shot-2023-11-13-at-09-35-18-1-768x318.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>As each roadmap milestone is met, 5% of the total supply is burned. This amounts to a total burn of 25%, which is a significant figure. The price per token is now $0.0052, in the second stage.</p>
<p>This will rise to $0.0068 by the final stage (stage ten). There are 840 million tokens available in this presale out of the total 2.1 billion supply. </p>
<p>This is a crypto interest account that further provides substantial upside potential, especially if the approval comes in, which might arrive as early as December 2023.</p>

<p>This platform combines token staking and cloud mining. While cloud mining has grown in popularity, third-party corporations have been prone to scam investors with their dubious activities. By tokenizing cloud mining, Bitcoin Minetrix provides security to investors and gives them control over their assets. </p>
<p>At present time, one can buy $BTCMTX through the ongoing presale. You can automatically stake your holdings once you purchase at least $10 worth of tokens. The live APY (Annual Percentage Yield) being offered is more than 240%. </p>
<p>By staking tokens, investors can also earn cloud mining credits. These credits, once burnt on the platform, will be converted into Bitcoin mining power. Thus, users can earn a percentage of mining revenues and gain an allocated mining time. </p>

<p>$BTCMTX has a total supply of 4 billion tokens, 2.8 billion of which are allocated for the presale. The current token price is $0.0112, though this will rise at each progressive stage of the 39-stage presale. The presale is also hosting a $30K airdrop. </p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix wants to raise a hard cap of over $32 million by the end of the presale. The high interest and cloud mining utility can make it one of the top cryptos to buy in the coming years.

<h3><strong>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Passive Income Ethereum Platform With Dynamic Staking And Betting Opportunities, Raises $700K</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is a new initiative that takes some of the world&#8217;s most successful meme icons &#8211; Doge, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Floki, etc &#8211; and pits them against each other in combat. The presale has raised over $700,000 so far.</p>
<h3> <img decoding="async" width="900" height="440" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121571" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698396764-screen-shot-2023-10-27-at-06-43-34-1.png" alt="Meme Kombat homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698396764-screen-shot-2023-10-27-at-06-43-34-1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698396764-screen-shot-2023-10-27-at-06-43-34-1-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698396764-screen-shot-2023-10-27-at-06-43-34-1-768x375.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698396764-screen-shot-2023-10-27-at-06-43-34-1-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698396764-screen-shot-2023-10-27-at-06-43-34-1-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1698396764-screen-shot-2023-10-27-at-06-43-34-1-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></h3>
<p>Players can bet on the outcome of the fights as a means of ROI, in three primary betting formats (Direct, P v P, and P v Game). Side bets are also an option for more detailed wagers with specific outcomes. </p>
<p>Fight outcomes are processed on the blockchain for automatic, transparent redistribution of rewards. AI-rendered state-of-the-art visuals help to enhance the gameplay considerably, with engaging fight depictions. </p>
<p>The platform further provides a steady 112% APY. The presale allows for automatic staking upon purchase &#8211; nothing needs to be done. Staking has a lock period of 10 days. </p>
<p>After the dApp is rolled out, dynamic staking will become an option, with an APY that fluctuates depending on the total amount staked. Users can decide how much they would like to allocate to staking and how much to betting, a useful feature for those seeking to manage their balances effectively. </p>

<p>The Meme Kombat presale token supply is 60 million $MK, half of the total supply of 120 million. Of the remaining tokens, 30% is reserved for staking, 10% for DEX, and 10% for community. This means that there is no allocation to the core team.</p>
<p>Plus, the founder has revealed his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattw8047814774/">identity on LinkedIn</a>, and the smart contract audit was a success, with no serious issues found within the code base. </p>
<p>The price per token is $0.1667, though this is set to jump to $0.183. This price could further rise upon exchange listing or at a further presale date. </p>

<h3><b>4. TG.Casino &#8211; Get Up to 310% Staking APYs with this Telegram Cryptocurrency Casino </b></h3>
<p>While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino">TG.Casino</a> is not exactly a cryptocurrency interest account &#8211; it does offer huge annual yields through its staking contract. TG.Casino is a fully licensed Telegram casino and sportsbook offering huge matched deposit bonuses and rewards. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1234" height="692" class="aligncenter wp-image-126742" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699007532-screen-shot-2023-11-03-at-12-42-33-pm.png" alt="TG.Casino token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699007532-screen-shot-2023-11-03-at-12-42-33-pm.png 1234w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699007532-screen-shot-2023-11-03-at-12-42-33-pm-300x168.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699007532-screen-shot-2023-11-03-at-12-42-33-pm-1024x574.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699007532-screen-shot-2023-11-03-at-12-42-33-pm-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1234px) 100vw, 1234px" /></p>
<p>$TGC, the native cryptocurrency, is the key to earning exclusive perks and passive income in the ecosystem. Currently, this token is priced at just $0.15 on presale. Interested investors who invest in $TGC can instantly stake the token on TG.Casino’s smart contract to earn annual yields. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, TG.Casino is offering an annual yield of 310%. However, this number will change as more tokens are locked in the smart contract. This multi-use token can also be held to gain access to exclusive games and rooms on the TG.Casino. One of the main benefits of $TGC is the high cashback. </p>
<p>Users can get 25% cashback on any losses incurred when making bets with the $TGC token. A deflationary cryptocurrency &#8211; the $TGC supply will also decrease over time. Once TG.Casino starts accumulating profits, it will start buying back tokens from other decentralized exchanges. </p>

When signing up on the TG.Casino &#8211; newcomers can get a 200% welcome bonus of up to 10 ETH on their first deposit.</p>
<p>From a total supply of 100 million &#8211; 40 million tokens are available during the presale. Another 20 million tokens are allocated for staking rewards.

<h3>5. Wall Street Memes &#8211; Extremely Popular Meme Token That Raised $25 Million on Presale, Now Live on OKX</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is a new staking token that has already proven to be wildly popular among investors, raising a huge $25 million in its sold-out presale.</p>
<p>Few presales reach anywhere near this amount, and now the token has been listed on the OKX exchange. </p>
<p>There are multiple reasons for its popularity. The project has seen interaction from Elon Musk on Twitter, a figure that has raised the price of Doge on multiple occasions. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/331762/wsm-token-home.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes token" /></figure>
<p>Meme coins that target wall street and mainstream actors have also proven to be extremely successful in recent years. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu enjoyed explosive returns as retail investors want a way of leveling the playing field.</p>
<p>And some of the meme tokens are hilarious, entertaining, and often quite accurate, proving a hit amongst retail investors. People feel that they are part of a unified group, termed an “army”, but the protest is fun and peaceful. Last, but not least, such tokens serve as crypto interest accounts. Meaning it is possible to take part in a community but also earn interest with staked tokens. </p>
<p>At the present time, Wall Street Memes is offering an estimated APY yield of 68%, with a total of 293,350,640 coins staked. In terms of token allocation, 50% go to marketing, 30% to community rewards, 10% to DEX liquidity, and 10% to CEX liquidity.</p>

<p>$WSM is currently trading in the $0.039 zone. </p>

<h3>6. eTukTuk &#8211; New Crypto Interest Account Offers 33,487% And Green Transport Model</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/en"><u>eTukTuk (TUK)</u></a> is an eco-friendly campaign that aims to replace TukTuks with Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs). </p>
<p>TukTuks are 3-wheeled vehicles frequently used in developing countries, and they have a heavy carbon footprint that is worse than that of a car.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/332129/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token presale page" /></figure>
<p>eTukTuk plans to replace them with a battery powered vehicle that is more environmentally friendly and far more affordable to purchase. This means there will be no fuel costs for drivers, who do not earn much of an income anyway.</p>
<p>So drivers can purchase it for cheaper, with no fuel costs, and benefit from staking the native TUK token. This token is currently generating rewards of 33,487% with a reward schedule of 4.75 per Block.</p>
<p>The TUK token can also be used by drivers with additional benefits such as bonuses and rewards. The electric vehicles will incorporate AI, which will select the best possible routes to further save on energy consumption and unnecessary waste.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/332130/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk token staking" /></figure>
<p>This ecosystem is launched from the Binance Smart Chain, for increased speed and lower costs than other blockchains. </p>
<p>Binance uses proof-of-stake-authority, which is more eco friendly than both Ethereum (proof-of-stake) and Bitcoin (proof-of-work). eTukTuk has also <a href="https://coinsult.net/projects/etuktuk/"><u>undertaken a smart contract audit,</u></a> with no issues found.</p>
<p>The project is based in Sri Lanka, a county with a poor carbon footprint profile, and this is a national concern. This is an initiative that aims to bank the unbanked, repair the environment, remove socio economic barriers, upgrade the transport infrastructure, and install a sharing economy. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/332131/screen-shot-2023-09-29-at.jpg" alt="eTukTuk TUK token earnings" /></figure>
<p>In other words, it has many aims and aspirations, but primarily seeks to bring people together under a more unified architecture, supported by decentralized technology and AI powered electric vehicles. It is a blockchain project for the people, and currently offers high yields.</p>
<p>There are a total of 2 billion TUK tokens. The price per token is $0.024, but this is likely to increase as time goes by. </p>
<p>More information can be found in the <a href="https://t.me/eTukTuk"><u>Telegram</u></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TukToken"><u>Twitter</u></a> accounts, as well as the <a href="https://etuktuk.io/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf"><u>Whitepaper</u></a>. </p>

<h3>10. Binance &#8211; Global Exchange with Flexible Crypto Interest Accounts</h3>
<p>Binance has more than 21 million active users around the world and is one of the largest crypto platforms in the industry. The exchange’s version of interest-earning crypto services is called <i>Binance Earn.</i> Binance Earn includes a number of options, the most important of which are <i>Locked Staking</i> and <i>DeFi Staking</i>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/227114/image.jpg" alt="Binance exchange token earnings" /></figure>
<p>With <i>Locked Staking</i>, customers agree to lock up their assets for 30, 60, 90, or 120 days in exchange for an estimated APY. It’s similar to the crypto interest accounts found at many other platforms.</p>
<p><i>DeFi Staking</i> promises large yields in exchange for slightly more risk. Binance uses your funds on selected staking pools, which typically involve more volatile cryptocurrencies with less well-established followings.</p>
<p>The <i>DeFi Staking </i>program should not be confused with Binance Savings, in which funds are locked in the exchange and used as rewards for customers. Besides this, the DeFi Staking program also promises higher rewards in exchange for participating in various decentralized projects. </p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>21 million+ global users</li>
<li>Huge selection of coins for earning interest</li>
<li>Earn interest on deposits up to $150 million</li>
<li>Locked and DeFi staking programs available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some staking pools are sold out</li>
<li>Low rewards for flexible interest accounts</li>
</ul>

<h3>11. Coinbase &#8211; Best for New Crypto Investors to Earn Passive Income</h3>
<p>Coinbase is the largest crypto exchange based in the U.S. Because of this, as well as the large number of cryptocurrencies that it hosts, using the <i>Coinbase Earn</i> program in order to earn passive rewards is a highly attractive option for numerous users. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/227116/image.jpg" alt="Coinbase token earnings" /></figure>
<p>Coinbase allows users to earn passive income through their staking service. The service boasts good security features, but customers will need to lock up their assets while their coins are deposited into staking pools. </p>
<p>At the moment, Coinbase advertises APY of up to 5.75%. The minimum deposit can be as low as $1. While the list of eligible coins isn’t very large, this has grown in the past year. Customers can earn the highest rewards for digital coins of projects such as Tezos and Algorand.</p>
<p>Note that the program also allows users to earn select crypto coins in exchange for viewing informative videos and answering questions about those crypto projects. Furthermore, Coinbase also includes a DeFi Staking option for certain coins. </p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure and reputable company</li>
<li>Minimum deposits of as little as $1</li>

<p>There’s no minimum deposit to start earning rewards and no lock-up period for interest-earning funds.</p>

<h2>How Does Earning Interest on Crypto Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Let&#8217;s examine the best ways to earn interest on crypto in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-staking-coins.htm">Crypto staking</a> involves depositing an amount of a particular coin that functions on a proof-of-stake blockchain. The pledged coins help secure and run the protocol. </p>
<p>On the other hand, various exchanges, DeFi and CeFi (Centralized Finance) apps entice customers with sizable rewards for depositing their crypto assets. Most often, these funds will be locked for a set period, and the funds will be used to offer loans to other users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, companies such as Binance may have a product that uses elements of the previous strategies. For example, their <i>DeFi Staking </i>program allows users to earn large rewards for investing in decentralized projects pre-approved by the exchange. </p>
<p>In all cases, customers pledge their crypto assets in return for an additional passive income stream.</p>
<h2>Which Accounts Have the Best Crypto Interest Rates?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Established crypto exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase can also provide substantial rewards in exchange for locking up crypto assets. Meanwhile, BTC20 and XRP20 are two projects that offer robust staking rewards through their pools.</p>
<h2>What Cryptocurrencies Can You Earn Interest On?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While many companies aim to create unique investment programs, the two types of investment opportunities involve either stablecoins or cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Stablecoins are a type of digital asset whose value is consistently pegged to a fiat currency, most often the U.S. dollar. They typically involve lower market volatility. Companies tend to offer higher rewards for these types of deposits. </p>
<p>DeFi apps and exchanges will also deliver yields for popular cryptocurrencies whose value varies based on the rules of supply and demand. The most popular crypto coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, will almost always be included in the list of available options. Well-established coins such as Cardano, Litecoin, and Dogecoin may also be included. </p>
<p>Companies will pay higher rewards for cryptocurrencies that are in demand. This is because the funds provided by customers will, most often, be used to supply loans for other crypto users.</p>
<h2>What is Crypto Compound Interest?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>When depositing funds in a bank and with a crypto company, you will sign up either for simple interest or crypto compound interest.</p>
<p>Simple interest is a percentage based on the principal amount (the original sum) of the deposit. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the compound interest rate is based on the principal amount and the interest that accumulates over a determined period. The interest is paid out frequently &#8211; for example, weekly &#8211; and then begins to earn interest itself. So, returns compound over time.</p>
<p>Not all crypto companies that offer yields when depositing include crypto compound interest. In fact, many of the best crypto interest rate account programs do not. However, some of the notable ones that do include BlockFi, Nexo, and Holdnaut.</p>
<p>For example, BlockFi will offer this kind of rate for over 20 crypto coins at an APY of as much as 3.5%. Note that you’ll get higher rewards on this service for larger crypto deposits. </p>
<h2>How to Earn Interest on Crypto &#8211; Step by Step Guide</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Taking advantage of the interest rate program offered by Crypto.com is a simple process. Here are the steps that you will need to follow: </p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Sign up for Crypto.com</strong></p>
<p>Register for an account or log in to Crypto.com. For investors who don’t already have an account, download the Crypto.com app. Tap Sign Up and then enter details including name, email, phone number, and address.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: <strong>Visit Earn</strong></p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/227101/image.jpg" alt="Crypto earn APY" /></figure>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: <strong>Select Crypto and Term</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the cryptocurrency to be deposited in the interest-earning account and choose the lock-up period. A longer lock-up period will come with a higher interest rate.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/90676/227102/image.jpg" alt="Crypto earn staking term" /></figure>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: <strong>Start Earning</strong></p>
<p>Crypto.com calculates rewards daily and deposits interest in a Crypto.com wallet once per week. These interest payments are available to use immediately.</p>
<h2>Is Crypto Interest Taxed?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto interest is currently taxed in most areas of the world. Typically, crypto interest is treated as a capital gain similar to if an investor made money because the price of a crypto token increased.</p>
<p>Investors must report their income from crypto interest when reporting taxes. Failure to do so could result in penalties or fines.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are numerous reputable companies offering crypto interest accounts to help investors earn more money from their crypto holdings. </p>
<p>Where can you find the best crypto interest accounts? Coinbase, Crypto.com, and BlockFi are all good options, offering transparency and security as well as good rates through products such as staking and yield farming.</p>
<p>One of the top ways to earn interest is through Bitcoin ETF Token. By staking $BTCETF tokens into the Ethereum smart contract, investors can earn more than 500% dynamic APY. The account also offers substantial upside potential depending on SEC regulatory approval of BTC ETFs, as well as a presale price increase of nearly 40% from the first to last round. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite all the crypto controversy of 2023, there’s no doubt that it has been a fantastic year for meme coins. Trading volumes have soared to a two-year high and some new cryptos even made it to the top 100. Pepe Coin ($PEPE) took meme coins back to their simple roots, copying the genesis of Dogecoin by releasing a throwback meme of 2016’s ‘Pepe the Frog’ and letting the community take it from there. Meanwhile, Wall Street Memes ($WSM) released a coin, after popular demand from the creator’s NFT collection Wall St Bulls, and raised over $13M in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/">Doge Uprising ($DUP)</a> is blending a defiant spirit with an immersive world and their $DUP token, leading the charge into the meme coin crypto world. Hoping to redefine the crypto meme space, Doge Uprising promises to be a coin that’s here to stay, repeating the successes of Pepe Coin and Wall Street Memes in Q4 of 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-127885" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699348861-dup.jpg" alt="Doge Uprising" width="1000" height="337" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699348861-dup.jpg 1999w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699348861-dup-300x101.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699348861-dup-1024x345.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699348861-dup-768x259.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699348861-dup-1536x518.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2><b>Why Did Pepe Coin Have So Much Success?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After its launch on 16th April 2023, Pepe Coin leapt by nearly 7,000% over the following 17 days. By May 5th, the coin had a market value of $1.8B. This huge rate of success sparked widespread investor interest in meme coins as a whole, and trading volumes jumped from $408,000 to $2.6B in only one week.</p>
<p>But why Pepe Coin specifically? The Pepe Coin frenzy came right as Bitcoin was starting to stall and investors were looking elsewhere. When the mainstream market is looking unstable, traders will often shift their focus onto the smaller coins launching in the space. Interestingly, Pepe Coin is self-proclaimed ‘completely useless’. The project was launched for the people without any formal team or roadmap in place for its future. Just like Dogecoin, this crypto has been made for community entertainment purposes only. However, one move that certainly helped its sudden popularity was Pepe Coin’s quick listing on major centralized exchanges, including Binance, enabling derivative trading for the coin.</p>
<h2><b>The Secret Behind Wall Street Memes’ Popularity</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another coin to blow up this year was Wall Street Memes. Back in 2021, the $WSM team released a collection of NFTs via their popular Twitter account, named ‘Wall Street Bulls’. The 10,000-piece collection sold out within 32 minutes, making the creators over $2.5M. The team has since made a second collection, entitled ‘Wall Street Bulls Ordinals’ hoping to see the same level of success.</p>
<p>After these NFT launches blew up, the Wall Street Bulls community called out for the creation of a meme coin &#8211; and the result was Wall Street Memes. Within minutes of the presale launch, over $100K was raised, which quickly turned into over $13M in the weeks that followed.</p>
<p>The secret key to the success of both of these meme coins was <i>community trust</i>.</p>
<h2><b>Doge Uprising Bursts Onto The Scene With A New Immersive Project</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Doge Uprising team saw the meme coin mania of 2023 and decided that it was the perfect opportunity to launch their immersive new crypto project. The $DUP token acts as the heart of the Doge Uprising ecosystem, powering the project forward. The key to Doge Uprising is community, which is why they’re the first coin to launch an interactive manga series, smart staking, Web3 universe, and meme coin token. Join the Doge Uprising via impressive Doge Mechas by purchasing one of their exclusive NFTs, or delve into their intricate storyline through their interactive manga series.</p>

Join the Doge Uprising now before prices skyrocket and find yourself piloting a giant mechanical Mecha before the year is out.</p>

<p>SURF Reward is a new crypto project that aims to pay users for the time they spend looking at ads online. It envisions a more fair world where everyone can earn $SURF tokens for their attention instead of sending ad revenue exclusively to webmasters.</p>
<p>SURF Reward’s presale has gotten off to a hot start, raising more than $240,000 in its first days. To help investors weigh whether $SURF could be the next explosive token, our <b>SURF Reward price prediction </b>will take a closer look at where this crypto project might go.</p>
<h2>SURF Reward Price Prediction Summary</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>End of 2023: </b>SURF Reward plans to launch $SURF at a price of $0.05. We expect the token could jump more than 5x after launch to a price of $0.27 by the end of 2023.</li>
<li><b>End of 2025: </b>SURF Reward’s advertising network and revenue is expected to grow significantly in the next 2 years. This benefits the token’s price since 60% of all ad revenue goes into the $SURF liquidity pool. So, we predict $SURF will reach a price of $0.55 by the end of 2025.</li>
<li><b>End of 2030: </b>Online advertising is expected to be a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/23/2633485/28124/en/Digital-Advertising-and-Marketing-Global-Market-to-Reach-1-5-Trillion-by-2030-Influencer-Marketing-is-Powerful-Weapon-for-Digital-Marketing-Teams.html">$1.5 trillion market by 2030</a>. SURF Reward is poised to benefit from this growth and continue growing its share of advertising revenue. As a result, we predict $SURF will end the decade at a price of $1.25.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SURF Reward Price History</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://surfreward.io/">SURF Reward</a> launched its presale in October 2023 with a goal of raising $5 million from sales of its $SURF token.</p>
<p>The $SURF token is a BEP-20 coin built on the Binance Smart Chain that entitles token holders to staking rewards and a share of advertising revenue from the SURF Reward network.</p>
<p>SURF Reward has gotten off to an impressive start, raising more than $240,000 from its presale. The presale has a soft cap of $1.5 million.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1330" height="1034" class="aligncenter wp-image-124381" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale.png" alt="SURF Reward token presale" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale.png 1330w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale-300x233.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale-1024x796.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale-768x597.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1330px) 100vw, 1330px" /></p>
<p>The $SURF presale is split into several stages with the price increasing from $0.25 to a planned list price of $0.50. Each stage lasts up to 7 days or until it sells out. Once the presale ends, SURF Reward will launch the $SURF token on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>During the current stage of the presale, investors can buy $SURF at a price of $0.027. For a limited time, the project is offering bonus interest for $SURF staking. Presale investors who buy and stake their tokens can earn an incredible 5,000% APY.</p>
<p><b>Key Points:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>$SURF is a BEP-20 token that offers staking rewards and entitles token holders to a share of advertising revenue from the SURF Reward network.</li>
<li>The $SURF presale has a hard cap of $1.1 million and has already raised more than $240,000.</li>
<li>$SURF will list on centralized and decentralized exchanges at a price of $0.05.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SURF Reward Price Prediction 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SURF Reward is planning to launch its $SURF token in late 2023 at a price of $0.05. So, our $SURF price prediction for the remainder of 2023 is all about what will happen to this token in the aftermath of the launch.</p>
<p>Based on high demand for $SURF tokens during the presale, we anticipate that the token will perform extremely well once it hits exchanges. SURF Reward has limited the presale to 20% of the total $SURF token supply, meaning that the available supply for purchase during the launch will be small. Demand can easily outpace supply on the open market, sending the price of $SURF soaring.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="2134" height="662" class="aligncenter wp-image-124387" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771361-surf-reward-token-details.png" alt=" SURF Reward token details" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771361-surf-reward-token-details.png 2134w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771361-surf-reward-token-details-300x93.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771361-surf-reward-token-details-1024x318.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771361-surf-reward-token-details-768x238.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771361-surf-reward-token-details-1536x476.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771361-surf-reward-token-details-2048x635.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px" /></p>
<p>This demand will be driven by expectations for the project’s future success. There are a number of factors that suggest SURF Reward could upend the online advertising industry and enjoy enormous success:</p>
<ul>
<li>The company behind SURF Reward, Abelius Capital AG, has been established for 5 years and is led by a CEO with decades of business experience.</li>
<li>SURF Reward has already assembled an advertising network with more than 3,000 advertisers, including many Fortune 500 companies.</li>
<li>Anyone can use SURF Reward to view ads and earn $SURF, ensuring that the project will have global reach.</li>
<li>SURF Reward doesn’t require users to change their browsing activity at all, so it integrates seamlessly into users’ current lifestyles.</li>
</ul>
<p>SURF Reward’s success directly benefits investors in 2 ways. First, investors who own the $SURF token receive 30% of the revenue from every ad sale. So, the bigger SURF Reward’s ad network becomes, the more money $SURF token holders will receive.</p>
<p>Second, 60% of advertising revenue from the SURF Reward network goes into the $SURF liquidity pool. The bigger the liquidity pool, the more value there is backing the $SURF token. This should push up the token’s price, benefiting investors who already own $SURF.</p>
<p>Considering this long-term benefit to investors, we believe that the $SURF launch will be an explosive opportunity. At the low end, we anticipate $SURF will double in value by the end of the year—just a few weeks after the launch. At the high end, it’s possible that $SURF could deliver 10x returns, on par with some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">most popular meme coins</a>.</p>
<p>There’s likely to be a lot of volatility in the first weeks of trading in $SURF. With this in mind, we predict a price of $0.27 by the end of the year. That’s a 440% gain from the planned launch price and a 10x gain from the current presale price.</p>
<h2>SURF Reward Price Prediction 2025</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We predict $SURF will surge in 2024 and 2025 as it proves the value of its approach to online advertising.</p>
<p>SURF Reward plans to pay users rather than websites for online ads. This is a massive change from the existing revenue structure for online advertising, in which <a href="https://www.playwire.com/blog/how-much-ad-revenue-can-a-website-make">webmasters typically earn the lion’s share of revenue</a> for hosting ads.</p>
<p>But SURF Reward recognizes that users are spending time and attention and should be rewarded for that. And who doesn’t want to make money simply for browsing the web in the same way that they’re already doing? We expect that the SURF Reward browser extension, which is required to view SURF Reward ads and earn $SURF tokens, will be widely downloaded around the world.</p>
<p>There’s a flywheel effect in play that will further benefit SURF Reward. As the number of SURF Reward users increase, more advertisers will flock to the network and pay increasingly higher prices to place ads. That will increase the rewards paid to users, thus encouraging even more people to add SURF Reward to their browser.</p>
<p>We expect this virtuous cycle to start developing in 2024-2025, although it will likely take several more years to fully develop. As revenue flows in, $SURF token holders will earn more through revenue sharing and see the price of $SURF rise thanks to a swelling liquidity pool.</p>
<p>Investors can also stake their $SURF tokens to earn rewards in the form of additional $SURF tokens. These staking rewards encourage investors to hold onto their $SURF coins, keeping them off the market and ensuring that demand continues to outpace supply.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, we predict that $SURF will increase in price to $0.55 by the end of 2025. This represents roughly a doubling of the token’s price from our 2023 prediction and a more than 10x gain from launch.</p>
<h2>SURF Reward Price Prediction 2030</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The growth cycle that SURF Reward has set up for itself will be fully realized by 2030. The user base will likely continue to grow, but investors may look forward to significant returns from their $SURF holdings and a massive liquidity pool that SURF Reward can use to fund new initiatives.</p>
<p>At the same time, the online advertising industry is expected to grow exponentially by 2030. Grand View Research, a market research firm, suggests that the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-advertising-market-report">market for online ads could grow at a 15.7% compound annual growth rate</a> between 2023 and 2030.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1552" height="794" class="aligncenter wp-image-124389" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771448-barchart-of-digital-ad-spending-2019-2024.png" alt="Barchart of Digital Ad Spending 2019-2024" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771448-barchart-of-digital-ad-spending-2019-2024.png 1552w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771448-barchart-of-digital-ad-spending-2019-2024-300x153.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771448-barchart-of-digital-ad-spending-2019-2024-1024x524.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771448-barchart-of-digital-ad-spending-2019-2024-768x393.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771448-barchart-of-digital-ad-spending-2019-2024-1536x786.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px" /></p>
<p>This provides a significant tailwind for SURF Reward. The project doesn’t necessarily need to steal advertisers away from existing ad networks to grow. It can simply add to its slice of a growing pie.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note is that the tokens SURF Reward has allocated for staking rewards will have run out by 2030. This means that the project will likely need to purchase $SURF on the open market to continue to offer staking rewards to investors.</p>
<p>A large buyback program, supported by the project’s liquidity pool, will further push up the price of $SURF.</p>
<p>Considering all of these factors, we predict that $SURF will reach a price of $1.25 by the end of 2030.</p>

<h2>Potential Highs and Lows of SURF Reward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As with any crypto price predictions, our predictions for $SURF come with some uncertainty. The table below shows possible highs and lows for $SURF token’s price around our predictions.</p>
<h3>What Is SURF Reward?</h3>
<p>SURF Reward is a new crypto project that aims to transform how revenue is distributed from online advertising. In today’s online advertising system, ad networks and webmasters split all the revenue. Even though web users are the ones looking at ads, they don’t see a cent in compensation.<img decoding="async" width="2350" height="1310" class="aligncenter wp-image-124386" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771257-surf-reward-homepage.png" alt="SURF Reward token presale page" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771257-surf-reward-homepage.png 2350w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771257-surf-reward-homepage-300x167.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771257-surf-reward-homepage-1024x571.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771257-surf-reward-homepage-768x428.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771257-surf-reward-homepage-1536x856.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771257-surf-reward-homepage-2048x1142.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2350px) 100vw, 2350px" />SURF Reward aims to cut out the middlemen and pay users for the ads they see. The project offers a browser extension that will remove most of the ads on a webpage and replace them with ads from SURF Reward’s network.</p>
<p>Users who view these ads will then earn $SURF tokens for their time and attention. The project plans to distribute 10% of revenue from its ads to users. SURF Reward already has a network of more than 3,000 advertisers whose ads it will distribute and pay users for seeing.</p>
<p>SURF Reward also pays out a portion of its revenue—30% of each ad sale—to investors in its $SURF token. The $SURF token is one of many <a href="https://www.liquifi.finance/post/token-utility-revenue-capture">new cryptocurrencies that create value through revenue sharing</a> with token holders.</p>
<p>SURF Reward Staking SURF Reward also offers staking rewards for $SURF token holders. The staking rate varies over time, but investors are locked into a specific rate when they stake their tokens. So, even if the staking rate goes down, investors will continue to earn at the original high rate they staked at.</p>
<h3>Tokenomics</h3>
<p>This is important right now because SURF Reward is offering a 5,000% APY staking rate for a limited time during the presale. Investors will continue to earn 5,000% APY as long as they continue staking their $SURF tokens.</p>
<p>Notably, there are no lock-up periods and no fees for $SURF token staking. The $SURF cryptocurrency has a total supply of 1 billion tokens allocated in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>$SURF Rewards: </b>39% (390 million tokens)</li>
<li><b>Liquidity and marketing: </b>25% (250 million tokens)</li>
<li><b>Presale: </b>20% (200 million tokens)</li>
<li><b>Staking: </b>8% (80 million tokens)</li>
<li><b>Development Reserve: </b>6% (60 million tokens)</li>
<li><b>Project team: </b>2% (20 million tokens)</li>
</ul>
<p>The $SURF presale has a soft cap of $1.5 million and a hard cap of $5 million.<img decoding="async" width="1864" height="956" class="aligncenter wp-image-124384" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771086-surf-reward-tokenomics.png" alt="SURF Rewards Tokenomics" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771086-surf-reward-tokenomics.png 1864w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771086-surf-reward-tokenomics-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771086-surf-reward-tokenomics-1024x525.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771086-surf-reward-tokenomics-768x394.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771086-surf-reward-tokenomics-1536x788.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1864px) 100vw, 1864px" /></p>
<h2>What Influences the SURF Reward Price?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The price of the $SURF token is influenced by a number of factors. Let’s take a closer look at the most important ones.</p>
<h3>Ad Revenue</h3>
<p>The amount of ad revenue that SURF Reward generates directly impacts both the amount of revenue that is shared with $SURF token holders and the size of the project’s liquidity pool. So, the more revenue that SURF Rewards generates, the bigger and more positive the impact on the price of the $SURF token.</p>
<p>SURF Reward’s ad revenue will be affected primarily by how many advertisers are in the SURF Reward network and how many users SURF Reward has. The more users that join SURF Reward, the more likely advertisers are to join the network and spend more money on ads.</p>
<h3>Staking Rates</h3>
<p>The interest rate that SURF Reward offers for staking $SURF tokens varies over time. A higher staking rate is expected to increase the price of $SURF since it becomes more lucrative to hold and stake the token.A higher staking rate will also encourage existing $SURF investors to hold onto their tokens. This keeps them off the open market and ensures that demand outpaces supply.</p>
<h3>Crypto Regulation</h3>
<p>It remains unclear in the US whether revenue sharing tokens such as $SURF are considered securities by the SEC. The SEC has suggested that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-makes-crypto-asset-security-us-2023-06-07/">revenue sharing could constitute an investment contract</a>, which would enable the SEC to regulate these tokens.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have long been under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty in the US. That said, investors should keep in mind that enforcement action by the SEC or introduction of new crypto regulations by Congress could impact the price of $SURF.</p>
<h3>Macroeconomic Trends</h3>
<p>Macroeconomic trends strongly impact ad spending. Typically, ad spending increases during bull markets and <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/10084/advertising-in-times-of-crisis/">decreases during recessions</a>.</p>
<p>This is important for SURF Reward, since the project’s ad network is likely to grow or shrink based on macroeconomic conditions just like other ad networks. A bear market could reduce the revenue shared with $SURF token holders and negatively impact the price of the token.</p>
<h2>How to Buy SURF Reward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We’ll briefly explain how to buy $SURF tokens during the SURF Reward presale.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Get a Crypto Wallet</h3>
<p>Investors will need a crypto wallet that can hold BEP-20 tokens like $SURF. We recommend MetaMask because it’s free and highly secure. Create a strong password and store the seed phrase in a safe place.<img decoding="async" width="2128" height="1242" class="aligncenter wp-image-123610" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet.png" alt="MetaMask Crypto Wallet Homepage" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet.png 2128w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-300x175.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-1024x598.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-768x448.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-1536x896.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-2048x1195.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2128px) 100vw, 2128px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2: Transfer USDT</h3>
<p>Investors will need Tether (USDT) to exchange for $SURF tokens during the presale. They can buy USDT through a centralized crypto exchange with fiat or directly through MetaMask if they already own another crypto token.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Visit the SURF Reward Presale and click ‘Connect Wallet.’</h3>
<p>Select the wallet to connect and follow the prompts to complete the connection.<img decoding="async" width="1330" height="1034" class="aligncenter wp-image-124381" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale.png" alt="SURF Reward Presale " srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale.png 1330w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale-300x233.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale-1024x796.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698771008-surf-reward-presale-768x597.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1330px) 100vw, 1330px" /></p>
<h3>Step 4: Purchase $SURF</h3>
<p>Enter the amount of $SURF tokens to buy in USDT. The presale platform will display the equivalent number of $SURF tokens at the current presale price. Click ‘Buy $SURF’ to complete the transaction.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Stake $SURF</h3>
<p>All purchased $SURF tokens will be available to claim when the presale ends. In the meantime, investors can stake their $SURF tokens and earn up to 5,000% APY.Click ‘Staking’ at the top of the SURF Reward presale site. Enter the number of $SURF tokens to stake, then click ‘Stake.’ Staked tokens can be unlocked at any time.<img decoding="async" width="1628" height="1142" class="aligncenter wp-image-123606" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking.png" alt="SURF Reward token staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking.png 1628w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-300x210.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-1024x718.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-768x539.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-1536x1077.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1628px) 100vw, 1628px" /></p>
<h2>Best Exchange to Buy Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Binance is the largest crypto exchange in terms of spot and derivatives volume traded every day. With over 160 million users, the volume numbers can only grow.</p>
<p>Of course, you may not be able to buy $SURF on Binance at the moment, but you can often grab new tokens in their presale phase via the Binance Launchpad. Over 70 projects have raised more than $100 million so far, giving Binance&#8217;s users early access before the tokens are listed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-136714 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1701089717-binance.jpg" alt="Binance mobile app" width="900" height="557" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1701089717-binance.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1701089717-binance-300x186.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1701089717-binance-768x475.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Moreover, trading cryptocurrencies comes with some of the lowest fees compared to other exchanges. Using the maker/taker fee model, you&#8217;ll pay 0.1% on any transaction. You can further lower your fees if you pay with BNB coins or if your trading volume exceeds $1 million in a 30-day period.</p>
<p>On top of that, you can lock your idle coins and tokens and earn rewards with Binance Earn. Depending on the cryptocurrency and the locking period, you can get anywhere between 2% and 100% in annual percentage rate.</p>
<p>All this makes Binance the best crypto exchange that could be worth utilizing to grow your crypto portfolio.</p>

<em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>

<p>SURF Reward is a hot new crypto project that’s helping everyday internet users earn tokens for the ads they view online. It turns the online advertising market on its head and enables $SURF investors to get paid every time they browse the web.</p>
<p>The project also offers massive staking rewards to early investors, making the $SURF token very attractive to many investors.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain everything investors need to know about SURF Reward and explain <b>how to buy $SURF token today</b>.</p>
<h2>What Is SURF Reward?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://surfreward.io/">SURF Reward</a> is a new project created by Abelius Capital AG, a German company with more than 5 years in the market. The project aims to revolutionize online advertising by paying users for the ads they view.</p>
<p>SURF Reward offers a browser extension that removes most of the ads that users would typically see on a website. It then replaces some of those ads with ads from its own advertising partners.</p>

<p>SURF Reward already has a network of more than 3,000 advertising partners, ensuring that the platform will get off to a strong start. According to Allied Market Research, the value of the <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/internet-advertising-market">online advertising market is expected to top $1 trillion by 2027</a>. So, the disruptive market potential for SURF Reward is enormous.</p>
<p>Revenue from these advertisements is split between SURF Reward and the users who view the ads. Users can claim their payment in the form of $SURF tokens, which they can then stake to earn even more $SURF tokens.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental change in the world of advertising. Traditionally, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/how-does-google-make-money-advertising-business-breakdown-.html">ad revenue is split between ad networks like Google AdSense and the websites that host the ads</a>. Internet users don’t see a dime. With SURF Reward, Google AdSense and websites are cut out as middlemen and internet users are paid for their time and attention.</p>
<p>SURF Reward doesn’t require users to change browsers or modify their existing browsing activity. So, users can earn from time they’re already spending on the web.</p>
<p>SURF Reward has raised more than $200,000 through a presale of its $SURF token. The presale is set to end on November 4, 2023.</p>
<h3>Staking Mechanics</h3>
<p>One of the key advantages that SURF Reward offers investors is a lucrative staking program. For a limited time, investors who stake their $SURF tokens can earn up to 5,000% APY.</p>
<p>This special APY is only available until October 31, so investors have to act fast to get it. Tokens locked at the bonus rate will continue to earn 5,000% APY until they are unstaked.</p>
<p>Notably, staking with SURF Reward doesn’t have any lock-up period. Investors are free to stake and unstake their tokens as often as they would like. There are also no fees for staking.</p>
<h3>Tokenomics and Presale Information</h3>
<p>SURF Reward has a total token supply of 1 billion $SURF tokens, of which 200 million are available to purchase during the presale. The $SURF token is a BEP-20 token built on Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>Notably, the <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/binance-smart-chain-vs-ethereum-what-s-the-difference">BSC blockchain has lower fees compared to Ethereum</a>. This is an advantage for investors since it means they’ll pay less when they transact with their $SURF tokens.</p>
<p>39% of the $SURF token supply is set aside to provide rewards to users who view Surf Rewards ads when browsing online. Another 8% of the supply is set aside for staking rewards.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1070" height="662" class="aligncenter wp-image-123607 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701947-surf-reward-tokenomics.png" alt="SURF Reward Tokenomics" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701947-surf-reward-tokenomics.png 1070w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701947-surf-reward-tokenomics-300x186.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701947-surf-reward-tokenomics-1024x634.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701947-surf-reward-tokenomics-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px" /></p>
<p>25% of the supply is committed to liquidity and marketing, and 6% to a development reserve. The remaining 2% is allocated to the project team and advisors.</p>
<p>The SURF Reward presale is going on now and has already sold more than $200,000 worth of $SURF tokens. The presale has a hard cap of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>During the current stage of the presale, investors can buy $SURF at a price of $0.027. That’s 46% below the planned list price of $0.05, meaning that early investors can lock in significant unrealized gains ahead of the project launch.</p>
<p>The presale is scheduled to end on November 4, 2023, or sooner if it sells out of $SURF tokens. After the presale ends, $SURF will list on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>The SURF Reward team plans to launch the $SURF token immediately following the end of the presale. According to the project’s roadmap, the SURF Reward browser extension and advertising platform will also launch in the 4th quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The project’s roadmap doesn’t extend beyond this launch. However, it is likely that SURF Reward will continue to build its network of advertising partners and make a major marketing push to encourage more users to join SURF Reward. <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2023/02/16/digital-advertising-more-expensive-small-online-retailers/">Online advertising has recently become more costly for small businesses</a>, so SURF Reward could present an attractive alternative for many business owners.</p>

<h2>How to Buy SURF Reward ($SURF) Tokens – Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Here’s how investors can buy $SURF tokens during the SURF Reward presale.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Get a Crypto Wallet</h3>
<p>In order to buy $SURF tokens, investors will need a crypto wallet that’s compatible with BEP-20 tokens. We recommend MetaMask because it’s free and works on mobile or in a web browser.</p>
<p>Visit the MetaMask website to download the wallet app. Set a secure password for the wallet and write down the seed phrase somewhere safe. This seed phrase is required to access the wallet if the password is ever lost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="2128" height="1242" class="aligncenter wp-image-123610 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet.png" alt="MetaMask Crypto Wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet.png 2128w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-300x175.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-1024x598.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-768x448.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-1536x896.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698702100-metamask-crypto-wallet-2048x1195.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2128px) 100vw, 2128px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2: Transfer Funds to the Wallet</h3>
<p>Investors must have Tether (USDT) in their crypto wallet in order to buy $SURF tokens during the presale. Investors can transfer USDT from another crypto wallet or an exchange.</p>
<p>If investors don’t already own crypto, they can use a centralized crypto exchange to buy USDT with fiat. Note that most exchanges <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-kyc-and-why-does-it-matter-for-crypto/">require ID verification to enforce anti-money laundering regulations</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Visit the SURF Reward Presale</h3>
<p><a href="https://surfreward.io/">Head to the SURF Reward presale site</a> and click ‘Connect Wallet.’ Select MetaMask or another wallet to connect, then follow the prompts to authorize the connection.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="978" height="912" class="aligncenter wp-image-123608 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701949-connect-wallet-to-surf-reward-presale.png" alt="SURF Reward Connect Wallet" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701949-connect-wallet-to-surf-reward-presale.png 978w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701949-connect-wallet-to-surf-reward-presale-300x280.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701949-connect-wallet-to-surf-reward-presale-768x716.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></p>
<h3>Step 4: Purchase $SURF Tokens</h3>
<p>Enter the amount of $SURF tokens to purchase in USDT. The presale platform will automatically calculate the equivalent number of $SURF tokens based on the current presale price.</p>
<p>When ready, click ‘Buy $SURF’ to complete the transactions and purchase $SURF tokens.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Stake $SURF</h3>
<p>All tokens purchased during the presale will be transferred to investors’ wallets after the presale ends on November 4. In the meantime, investors can take advantage of up to 5,000% APY interest by staking their $SURF tokens.</p>
<p>With the wallet connected to the $SURF website, click Staking in the top menu. Then enter the number of $SURF tokens to stake. The dashboard will update to display the number of staked $SURF tokens an investor has. Investors can unstake their tokens at any time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1628" height="1142" class="aligncenter wp-image-123606 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking.png" alt="SURF Reward Staking" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking.png 1628w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-300x210.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-1024x718.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-768x539.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698701944-surf-reward-staking-1536x1077.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1628px) 100vw, 1628px" /></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg’s flagship company Meta has been slowly taking over the internet. Meta now owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp, meaning that Zuckerberg almost holds a complete monopoly over our most popular online spaces. In a new move, Meta has announced chatbots with a ‘personality’, further expanding Zuckerberg’s influence over the digital realm and competing with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>One project wary of Mark Zuckerberg’s ever-expanding empire is the new presale cryptocurrency <a href="https://dogeuprising.co/">Doge Uprising ($DUP)</a>. This coin takes us to 2045 and imagines a world where Zuckerberg has launched a technocratic rule. He’s expanded his online surveillance to the physical realm and has the world in his grasp.</p>
<p>Weaponising his oppressive vigilance, Zuckerberg has stolen our freedom and ignited an uprising. At the heart of the revolution are the Doge Mechas, colossal machines created by the rebels to end Zuckerberg’s tyrannical rule. At the core of these Mechas is one powerful tool &#8211; the $DUP token.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123879" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698747966-image2-e1698748017697.jpg" alt="Doge Uprising Mecha NFTs" width="900" height="303" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698747966-image2-e1698748017697.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698747966-image2-e1698748017697-300x101.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698747966-image2-e1698748017697-768x259.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h2><b>Should We Be Afraid Of Mark Zuckerberg?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although Doge Uprising’s Whitepaper tells a fictional story &#8211; it might not be miles from reality. Mark Zuckerberg has made some ominous moves recently that shouldn’t be ignored. Meta is reportedly creating dozens of chatbots with individual ‘personas’. These are aimed at younger users in an attempt to maintain engagement on its social media platforms.</p>
<p>The chatbots include some that will improve productivity, others that will help with coding, as well as a celebrity-specific tool that will help chat with fans. It’s evident that Zuckerberg is afraid of losing his grip on the digital realm and is doing everything he can to take the power back from Elon Musk.</p>
<p>At a gathering convened by the US Senate leader Chuck Schumer, tech industry experts urged for a balanced approach to AI regulation. Zuckerberg countered these concerns by stating that the only issues with AI are ‘safety and access’, and that the Senate should ‘engage with AI to support innovation’. It’s clear that Zuckerberg is on a mission to drive his AI chatbots further into our everyday lives, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has further expanded his Meta-empire with a recent release of Meta Quest 3 headsets, which blur the boundaries between virtual and reality, letting people see the outside world while immersed in a virtual experience. By obscuring this distinction, Zuckerberg is letting his influence over our digital lives merge into the physical, increasing both his influence and pool of data collection.</p>
<h2><b>Zuckerberg: The Perfect Villain?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The entrepreneur was recently named, alongside Jeff Bezos, as a billionaire investing in anti-ageing technology to artificially lengthen his life. Zuckerberg and his wife are the co-founders of The Breakthrough Prize, which awards $3M every year to any scientists who make ‘transformative advances’ toward ‘extending human life’.</p>
<p>With these technological advances in place, he could be setting himself up to become the perfect tech villain in 2045, as described by the new cryptocurrency presale Doge Uprising.</p>
<h2><b>Join The Uprising Today</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Doge Uprising could be ahead of the game, tearing down Zuckerberg &#8211; the dangerous tech mogul of the future. Meme coins are back and this one hits the ranks with a vengeance. With some coins like PEPE making it to the top 100, this is the perfect time to jump on a project with a strong roadmap and a passion for change.</p>
<p>Doge Uprising stands out from the crowd with a defiant spirit, immersive story (with a manga in the works) and the unforgettable $DUP token driving it all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123882" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698748156-image1.png" alt="Elon Musk Animation" width="900" height="518" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698748156-image1.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698748156-image1-300x173.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698748156-image1-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

<h3>1. Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) &#8211; Top BTC Mining Platform Using Ethereum Smart Contracts, $3.1M Raised Within One Month </h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en"><u>Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</u></a> is a brand new mining site with a creative solution to BTC mining difficulties. Users can purchase $BTCMTX, an ERC20 token, which is staked in return for Bitcoin cloud mining credits. These credits are burned in return for $BTCMTX rewards. </p>
<p>It’s a simple yet brilliant concept that removes much of the issues associated with centralized Bitcoin mining, and its harmful environmental consequences.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s Proof-Of-Work mining model is maintained by a small group of centralized mining companies. They possess expensive mining farms, running large hardware rigs. It is too expensive for ordinary people to run such rigs. It is also too technically challenging, requiring lots of study and business acumen.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin Minetrix allows people to earn rewards from a desktop, and plans to release a mobile application in the near future. They also have an integrated dashboard where users have a good overview of all their personal mining operations. They can decide how much to stake and how much to burn. No technical expertise is required and it&#8217;s an eco-friendly solution.</p>
<p>There are a total of 4 billion tokens available, with 2.8 billion (70%) available in the presale. The presale has 10 stages, with the prices increasing at each stage, meaning you will get a discount for early investment. The initial token price is $0.011 but will rise to $0.0148 <!-- notionvc: c784e4e6-2728-4e3c-ae21-92eac59f29f7 -->in stage 39, the final stage.</p>

<p>Another benefit of this mining site is that the initial investment is only $10, in comparison to the much larger figure seen with other sites. There is no cap on mining credits and they are not transferable.</p>
<p>Most other Bitcoin mining sites also rely on harmful, environmentally damaging mining rigs, but this uses Ethereum smart contracts which is a much fairer system that rewards everybody, not just miners.</p>

<h3>2. ECOS &#8211; Create Tailor-made Bitcoin Mining Contracts </h3>
<p><a href="https://ecos.am/en/cloud-mining?ref=DHAmMRcL&amp;utm_source=business2community&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=20220517_cloud-mining_none_world_all_regular&amp;utm_content=rating_8-best-bitcoin-mining-sites">ECOS </a>is a complete cryptocurrency investment platform offering an advanced wallet, a comprehensive exchange service, and cloud mining all-in-one.</p>
<p>What’s great about this platform is that you can tailor your mining contract at ECOS. You can choose your projected reward amount, the duration of your contract, and how much you are willing to invest.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89211/224019/ecos-bitcoin-mining.jpg" alt="ECOS Bitcoin mining page" /></p>
<p>Your investment ultimately determines the amount of hash power you get for mining. A longer contract length is more likely to yield bigger payouts as well.</p>
<p>Depending on the specifics of your contract, your profitability from crypto mining can range from 300% to over 600%. Your investment also comes with fixed-rate fees, so there are no additional costs for machine malfunctions. </p>
<p>Since this is a cloud mining operation, you need to buy any equipment of your own. However, if you want to really kick things up a notch, ECOS has an ASIC store with machines ranging from $5,300 to $8,200. There is also ASIC mining hosting on offer provided by a 60 MW data facility supported 24/7 by qualified staff. ECOS technicians maintain and operate any machines you decide to purchase.</p>
<p>ECOS even offers a 1-month free cloud mining contract, so you can try mining before taking out a serious long term contract. Prices remain rather low owing to ECOS’ mining center being located in the Free Economic Zone of Armenia. Payouts are earned daily and can be tracked using a dedicated mobile app for iOS and Android devices.</p>

<h3>3. Gminers &#8211; Low Fee Bitcoin Mining for Casual Investors</h3>
<p>Gminers is one of the newest crypto mining operations available to investors. In only a few short months this operation has already gained more than 3,000 active users. Not to be confused with the Gminer crypto mining software, Gminers is a cloud miner designed for even the most casual investor.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89211/224021/gminers-bitcoin-mining.jpg" alt="Gminers logo" /></figure>
<p>The operation’s uptime is close to 24/7. Gminers owns numerous data centers in extremely cost-effective and pro-crypto nations like Kazakhstan, Iceland, and Georgia. Payouts are daily and investors can choose from payment options like PayPal, bank transfers, or Bitcoin withdrawal to a crypto wallet. </p>
<p>Fees are quite low at Gminers. 1 GH/s of hash power starts at only $0.0120. Our calculations put the ROI at around 150% and you can reinvest with a new contract at any time. Casual investors can learn how their investment works through a handy dashboard that displays profits and investment data in real time.</p>

<h3>4. HashShiny &#8211; Mine 7 Different Tokens Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Founded back in 2017, HashShiny is one of the best crypto mining platforms for numerous reasons. Powered by hydroelectric and wind energy, HashShiny is an environmentally friendly cloud mining service. Their data center boasts more than 15,000 ASIC rigs that are guarded and serviced 24/7.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89211/224022/hashshiny-mining.jpg" alt="HashShiny Bitcoin mining" /></figure>
<p>This is more than just a Bitcoin mining operation. In fact, you can mine 7 different tokens simultaneously including Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash. Mining costs vary between each token and are charged as a hash rate fee and maintenance fee. For example, Bitcoin mining incurs a $0.0004 daily maintenance fee and a cost of $0.40 per 10 GH/s.</p>
<p>The use of renewable energy does help keep the fees low. However, note that the payout calculators at HashShiny don&#8217;t include the maintenance fee. So, users may find that they receive lower payouts than expected.</p>

<h3>6. TrustMining &#8211; Ethereum Specialists in Switzerland</h3>
<p>TrustMining is a leading cloud mining operation and has earned a reputation as one of the best crypto mining sites for rig hosting. While Bitcoin mining is supported at TrustMining, this platform specializes in the ETASH algorithm for Ethereum mining. TrustMining can host your rig in its Switzerland data center, where they’ll put your rig into production and maintain its efficiency.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89211/224025/trust-mining.jpg" alt="Trust Mining logo" /></figure>
<p>Overall, you’ll lose about 30% of your rewards to fees, which is in line with the industry average and leaves 70% as pure profit. Fees cover the electrical costs, accommodation costs in the data center, and a 10% commission fee. Through their partner 2miners.com, TrustMining uses only the very best crypto mining software and utilizes local European mining pools.</p>
<p>TrustMining also allows users to mine for Ethereum, but get paid in Bitcoin. In addition, TrustMining supports <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-staking-platforms.htm">crypto staking</a>, enabling users to increase their profits with a return between 4% and 25% APY.</p>

<h3>7. GenesisMining &#8211; Biggest Ethereum Mining Farm</h3>
<p>With more than 2 million active miners, GenesisMining is one of the biggest crypto mining platforms available to the average investor. The data center is based in Iceland and uniquely utilizes low-cost geothermal energy to power GPU machines with in-house crypto mining software.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89211/224020/genesis-mining.jpg" alt="Genesis Bitcoin Mining site" /></figure>
<p>Tokens are mined with at least 2 mining pools and in some cases 4 pools. When a pool is detected as closing in on 50% share, GenesisMining will switch to another. 6 tokens are available for mining including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and Litecoin. It is best to pay using cryptos at GenesisMining as USD transactions have a rather limiting hash per day rate.</p>
<p>During our reviews, GenesisMining was frequently out of stock, and it is currently rather difficult to rent a mining machine. A no maintenance fee plan is available for Ethereum mining and rentals starting at $499 and moving up to $4,999. Other plans have a fixed USD maintenance fee determined by the specific tailoring of each plan.</p>

<h3>8. BitDeer &#8211; Powerful AI Managed Cloud Mining</h3>
<p>BitDeer is another top managed mining operation that uses both GPU and ASIC machines. It has 5 data centers located around the world and boasts a mining hashrate of 7.0 GH/s. 3 of the data centers use 100% carbon-free power and all 5 centers combined use around 1,700 MW of power. A smart management system handles all the daily tediousness of mining to make things more efficient.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/89211/224017/bitdeer-bitcoin-mining.jpg" alt="BitDeer mining solution" /></figure>
<p>BitDeer is on the expensive side compared to other mining operations. The minimum investment is around $200 for Bitcoin. However, users will probably need to drop much more money as basic plans appear mostly unprofitable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, BitDeer plans are also sold out much of the time. Users can register their interest to stand a better chance of buying into a cloud mining plan.</p>

<h2>What is Crypto Mining?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto mining refers to the computational process undertaken to create new tokens for a particular cryptocurrency. The concept is fairly simple &#8211; computers go to work to solve problems and cryptocurrency is given back as a reward. However, the complete process is rather complex and requires dedicated crypto mining machines that are capable of solving advanced mathematical puzzles.</p>
<p>Essentially, miners act as a kind of middleman between users on a blockchain network. They validate transactions and distribute them to the ledger, thereby ensuring an irrefutable log of transactions. Miners are rewarded for their efforts with a number of new tokens.</p>
<p>There have been significant developments in the way people can mine cryptocurrencies, with dedicated crypto mining apps, and new methods that reduce costs and make it easier for the average investor. Cloud mining platforms let users rent a crypto mining machine and reap the rewards, while some of the best crypto mining software lets investors join incredibly lucrative mining pools.</p>
<h2>How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin mining has come a long way. Once upon a time, using a massively powerful crypto mining rig was the only way to mine for tokens. However, cloud mining lets everyday investors mine for tokens without the need for expensive equipment.</p>
<p>CPU and GPU mining is the most common process of Bitcoin mining as an average investor. Both methods require incredibly powerful machines that either use the computer&#8217;s CPU or graphics card to solve the complex puzzles required to validate a transaction. Miners that solve the puzzle first are rewarded with the block of Bitcoins.</p>
<p>The current block reward is 6.25 BTC. The best way of mining for Bitcoin is to use an ASIC machine. These devices are specifically designed purely for the purpose of cryptocurrency mining and substantially more powerful than a CPU/GPU device. When you hear about massive Bitcoin mining companies, these are the devices they’ll be using.</p>
<p>Most miners will join a Bitcoin mining pool – a collection of miners using their combined computing power and sharing the results – but it is possible to go it alone. Numerous solo miners have found success, such as the Solo CK miner that earned $220,000 from a single block in January, 2022.</p>
<h2>Is Cryptocurrency Mining Profitable?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In short, absolutely. A crypto mining machine can cost you around $2,000 if on a shoestring budget and Bitcoin miners are currently mining in the area of $20 million a day. However, low-end machines are far from efficient and with the value of Bitcoin rewards from mining set to halve in 2024, efficiency will be key.</p>
<p>This means purchasing or upgrading your crypto mining rig as more power simply means more efficiency. According to the Digicominists Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, a single Bitcoin transaction requires 1,449kWh of power to complete – almost two months of household power.</p>
<p>If you can spend the cash to obtain an efficient crypto mining machine, pay for electricity at an affordable rate, and can access quality and reliable mining pools, you may find profit in mining cryptocurrency the traditional way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, reliable pools may be your most important factor when considering Bitcoin mining, since the chances of finding a Bitcoin block is increasingly more difficult as more miners join the fray.</p>
<p>In July 2022, JPMorgan put the average cost of traditional Bitcoin mining at $12,000 per year but a single successfully mined block would net a reward of more than $130,000 in September, 2022.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Mining Bitcoin</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>For those wondering &#8216;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment.htm">is Bitcoin a good investment?</a>&#8216; Bitcoin mining poses many benefits as an investment opportunity. Using one of the best Bitcoin mining sites holds some advantages over traditional mining operations too. Mining is often misunderstood as overly complex and more trouble than it&#8217;s worth, but in actuality, there are plenty of reasons why investors should consider mining.</p>
<h3>Passive Income</h3>
<p>There isn’t much actual work to mining Bitcoin once you get started. Even less work if you choose to use one of the best crypto mining sites from our list. Bitcoin mining is a passive earner that can simply run in the background of your life while you continue to work a day job. You can even continue to trade cryptocurrency – either as an asset or a CFD – while mining.</p>
<h3>Critical Function</h3>
<p>As a crypto miner, you will be serving a very critical function of that cryptocurrency. Transactions need to be validated and crypto mining is the way to serve this purpose. You’ll be a part of something quite big and help to maintain a genuine, decentralized form of banking that is helping so many businesses and individuals.</p>
<h3>Big Payouts</h3>
<p>Trading cryptocurrencies can be difficult sometimes. Trying to predict a bull run isn’t always the easiest thing in the world and sometimes a small investment just isn’t big enough to net bigger results. Mining can provide big rewards though.</p>
<p>The 6.75 BTC reward for successful Bitcoin mining is a massive result, while the right cloud mining pool can potentially produce bigger results than your trading strategies.</p>
<h3>Abundance of Choice</h3>
<p>There isn’t an overly linear path to success when mining for cryptocurrency. So many crypto mining platforms exist that ensures you can shop around for new and improved crypto mining pools. You can also tweak and improve your rig as more advanced technology emerges or you may find a sale on better GPU chipsets.</p>
<h3>Environmentally Friendly</h3>
<p>Yes, some of the best Bitcoin mining platforms still use coal-fired plants and other polluting means of powering their operations, but that’s not the case for all of them. Some Bitcoin mining farm operations use renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>These are mostly cloud mining services, which allow users to mine without the horrible carbon footprint.</p>
<h2>Costs of Mining Cryptos</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Back in 2009, when only a handful of insightful people saw the potential in Bitcoin, it would only cost about $100 for a mining operation. Flash forward to 2023, and a traditional successful mining operation will run you tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The initial cost will be the setup of your crypto mining rig. On the lower-end of machines, you can use GPU cards such as a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti which will cost you around $500. On the top-end, a Radeon RX 6800 will set you back at least $1,000.</p>
<p>Piece together the various bits of necessary hardware, and the fact that multi-GPU machines are almost a necessity to stand a chance of success, the machine will likely run you a few grand. Next, you’ll need to consider electrical costs.</p>
<p>This will vary from state to state, with some states like North Dakota and Oklahoma boasting some of the lowest average electricity rates in the country and little to no income tax. This brings us to the third cost – taxes. States with low income tax rates will pay less tax on their mining windfalls than in other states.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Apps</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>There are hundreds of crypto mining apps that will let you use your iPhone or Android device to mine for tokens. This method will never replace the traditional machine methods as you can’t net anywhere near the same rewards and the wear on your device can be quite substantial.</p>
<p>Many Bitcoin mining apps on Google Play will need to be avoided. It’s very easy to publish an app that won’t actually do anything and you’ll need to do your research to ensure you download a reputable miner. The iOS App Store is far stricter and that has made it more difficult to find a miner, as Apple removes apps that are associated with cryptocurrency mining.</p>
<p>Many of these crypto mining apps are basically games that offer a small crypto reward for playing. Profits are rarely larger than a few dollars each month and you’ll need to consider the cost of charging your device – not to mention the wear and tear too.</p>
<p>There are some cloud mining pools available on iPhone and Android devices too, but mostly Bitcoin mining apps are a bit of fun, rather than a genuine income generator.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cloud mining in 2023 is more simple than ever. With only a quick sign-up, even the most novice of investors can mine cryptocurrency without buying any expensive equipment. </p>
<p>Based on our reviews of the best Bitcoin mining platforms, we think Bitcoin Minetrix is the top choice for most investors. </p>
<p>Users have complete control over their very own mining operation with a unique dash, and it offers a novel stake-to-mine model using Etherum, which is more eco-friendly than Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain, and requires no technical skill or upfront investment. </p>

<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Most Trending Crypto With High Staking APY And Token Burns For Long-Term Growth</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is a trending new crypto, especially due to the potential approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>As a deflationary token built on the Ethereum blockchain, $BTCETF is structured to reward holders in line with major developments surrounding Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>$BTCETF&#8217;s presale is structured across ten stages, with the token price currently at $0.0052 and projected to increase to $0.0068 by the final stage. This pricing strategy offers an attractive upside potential gain for early investors. </p>
<p>The presale&#8217;s success is evident, with over $670K raised in less than ten days of launch, highlighting strong investor interest and trust in the token’s future.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF whitepaper</a>, total supply of Bitcoin ETF Tokens is capped at 2.1 billion, with a planned 25% reduction through systematic burning. </p>
<p>This reduction will occur in 5% increments, triggered by key milestones related to the Bitcoin spot ETF&#8217;s approval and market performance, such as the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, $BTCETF reaching $100 million in trading volume, and Bitcoin ETFs achieving $1 billion in assets under management. </p>
<p>Additionally, a 5% transaction tax on $BTCETF trades is set to diminish as milestones are reached, eventually dropping to 0%.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>$BTCETF offers one of the highest staking APYs in the crypto market, over 300% at press time, providing early stakers with high returns. </p>
<p>However, this APY is expected to decrease as more tokens are staked, making early participation more advantageous. Over 75 million tokens have been staked, showing strong community trust and involvement.</p>
<p>Investors can buy $BTCETF using Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask and pay with ETH, USDT, or even through card transactions. However, purchases with MATIC and BNB are ineligible for staking APYs. </p>
<p>To stay updated on the latest developments and engage with other community members, investors can enter the <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Bitcoin ETF Token Telegram group</a> and follow project updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Get Allocated Crypto Mining Times by Staking this PoS Cryptocurrency, Over $3.1 Million Raised on Presale </strong></h3>
<p>One of the top trending cryptocurrency tokens right now is <a href="https://www.business2community.com/visit/bitcoinminetrix">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX). This project is reducing the entry barrier for mining cryptos, while offering more transparency. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/333345/bitcoin-minetrix-stake-to-mine.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix Stake To Mine" /></figure>
<p>The cloud mining space is run by corporations that rent out mining times to individuals. However, there are regular scams in this space, which makes it unsafe for users. Bitcoin Minetrix will solve this issue by tokenizing cloud mining credits. The platform will generate the credits as ERC-20 tokens, which are recorded and stored on the blockchain. </p>
<p>To earn these credits, token holders must stake $BTCMTX on an Ethereum-powered smart contract. By staking tokens, investors can also generate APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) above 190% at the present time. Once you start generating the cloud mining credits, they can be burned in exchange of Bitcoin mining power. </p>
<p>This power is used to get allocated cloud mining slots through which one can earn a share of Bitcoin and crypto mining revenues. Due to these use cases, Bitcoin Minetrix has been soaring on presale. Within one month, the presale has raised over $3.1 million. </p>
<p><iframe title="NEW 10X Potential Presale Bitcoin Minetrix MINES $BTC For YOU - Best Crypto to Buy Now?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOtU4UfV_3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The presale will consist of 20 rounds &#8211; where 2.8 billion tokens will be equally distributed. In total, Bitcoin Minetrix has a total supply of 4 billion tokens. During the first round, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.011 per token. The current price is $0.0114. </p>
<p>Thus, investors may wish to enter the presale before the price increases. Bitcoin Minetrix has set a hard cap target of $33.46 million by the end of the presale.

<h3>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Trending Crypto With $1M Raised, PoS APY, and Multi Meme Appeal</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat ($MK)</a> is a creative new Ethereum-powered presale that recently broke through the $1 million milestone mark. One reason this ecosystem is trending is due to the appeal it has of many memes. While most meme campaigns revolve around a single meme icon, Meme Kombat takes a number of popular memes and pits them against each other. </p>

<p>The memes fight against one another in combat, so users can expect to see Doge vs Wojack or Pepe vs Sponge, in an upcoming event. The fights are selected by AI at random and outcomes are processed on chain, with automatic reward allocation for increased transparency. This presale has also gone to great lengths in terms of the quality of its visuals, with AI-rendered graphics for enhanced appeal.  </p>
<p>Aside from the memes and the quality of visuals, the presale offers steady financial incentives. This includes a 10% price appreciation from the existing $MK price of $0.1667 to $0.183. APY is generated immediately upon purchase. And there are multiple betting options on the fights, though these returns depend on how skilled the player is.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en">Wall Street Memes</a> is a popular cryptocurrency platform that has existed since 2019. $WSM is an extension of the platform and functions as its native cryptocurrency. After Wall Street Memes released $WSM on presale in May 2023, this token has become one of the most trending projects in recent times. </p>
<p><iframe title="Next 10x Crypto Wall Street Memes Raises $3,750,000 - $WSM Best Meme Coin to Buy Now? &#x1f525;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tba2KNzlI0E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Over popular social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter, Wall Street Memes has generated a following of over 1 million people. This loyal fan base is helping Wall Street Memes become as popular as other trending meme coins, including Pepe ($PEPE) and Milady ($LADYS). </p>
<p>Wall Street Memes also released its own NFT project, Wall St Bulls, in 2019. During the first NFT collection drop, Wall St Bull managed to sell out 10,000 Ethereum-based NFTs in just 32 minutes. Through the $WSM presale, Wall Street Memes raised more than $25 million. Now, the $WSM token has listed in popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as OKX and Huobi.  </p>

<h3><strong>6. Chimpzee – Crypto NFT Project Dedicated to Wildlife Conservation and Climate Action</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Next on our list is an excellent financial, social, and passive income investment. If you have been thinking about contributing to climate action and wildlife protection &#8211; but don’t know where to start &#8211; you should look into Chimpzee.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/275731/image2.jpg" alt="Join The Chimpzee Army" /></figure>
<p><a href="/ext/chimpzee/"><u>Chimpzee</u></a> is a creative project dedicated to empowering wildlife conservation, which in turn, will boost climate action and vice versa. It stems from the realization that the environment can’t wait. Global warming and climate change are getting worse by the day. More people and businesses need to make eco-conscious efforts to save Earth from mass destruction. But traditional initiatives dedicated to the cause have proven inefficient. They are not scalable.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is where Chimpzee comes in. The project brings more excitement and engagement to these initiatives through crypto incentivization. This is how the ecosystem works.</li>
<li>Chimpzee sets aside 10% of its token supply and a portion of its profits to organizations dedicated to saving animals, stopping deforestation, and combating climate change.</li>
<li>The limited collections of Chimpzee NFT passports will give holders multiple benefits and rewards. </li>
<li>CHMPZ coins will be used for a wide range of payments in the ecosystem. </li>
<li>CHMPZ coins used to buy the Chimpzee NFT Passports will be burned (up to 10% of the total circulating supply) and taken out of circulation, supporting the value of these assets in the open market.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three-pillared ecosystem allows users to earn rewards through multiple methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play to earn (The Zero Tolerance Game) – Earn CHMPZ coins by achieving a series of predetermined benchmarks. </li>
<li>Trade to earn (NFT marketplace) – If you are an active trading user on the network, or hold an NFT passport &#8211; earn a percentage of the trading fee profits.</li>
<li>Shop to earn (Merchandise store) – Earn CHMPZ rewards by purchasing unique branded merchandise and supporting the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chimpzee’s current partners on the mission include The Giving Block, One Tree Planted, and the Wild Foundation. More will be announced in the future. <br /><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/275733/image1.jpg" alt="Chimpzee Presale Stages" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The ongoing presale of CHMPZ opens the most profitable gateway to the project. Interestingly, early presale participants can get up to 100% free bonus tokens. </p>

<p>The $YPRED token also offers several use cases in the ecosystem. For example, members can stake the native cryptocurrency to earn passive income. 10% of all new subscription revenue generated on yPredict is sent toward a staking pool. </p>
<p>The platform also distributed 15% of all swapping fees towards this staking pool. Thus, holders can receive a potentially high APY (Annual Percentage Yield). $YPRED can also be used to access the play-to-earn hub on yPredict. </p>

<h3><strong>8. Tamadoge &#8211; New Trending Meme Cryptocurrency to Buy</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge</a> is one of the most exciting new cryptocurrencies of this year and investors have taken notice, with the Doge-themed cryptocurrency selling out its presale in less than eight weeks to raise $19 million at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>TAMA tokens then rose by nearly 2,000% and although they have retraced amid the struggles of the crypto winter, the project is one of the most exciting for the next bull run.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="900" height="436" class="alignnone wp-image-124034 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698754095-screen-shot-2023-10-31-at-12-07-32.png" alt="TamaDoge Play To Earn Ecosystem" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698754095-screen-shot-2023-10-31-at-12-07-32.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698754095-screen-shot-2023-10-31-at-12-07-32-300x145.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698754095-screen-shot-2023-10-31-at-12-07-32-768x372.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698754095-screen-shot-2023-10-31-at-12-07-32-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698754095-screen-shot-2023-10-31-at-12-07-32-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1698754095-screen-shot-2023-10-31-at-12-07-32-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The main Tamadoge game sees players purchase NFT pets and grow them to adulthood &#8211; once the pets are fully grown, players can battle them against one another in the Tamadoge virtual arena. </p>
<p>Winning players climb the game’s leaderboard and earn TAMA, the native crypto token of the Tamadoge universe. TAMA can be used to buy additional NFT pets or to purchase in-game upgrades.</p>
<p>The gaming ecosystem also includes five Tamadoge Arcade games, where players can earn rewards for taking part in fun platform games, while augmented reality features are also in development.</p>
<p>What has investors so excited TAMA is that its tokenomics are deflationary, with 5% of the TAMA tokens used for every transaction in the pet store are removed from circulation and burned. </p>
<p>So, the more players who join Tamaodge and spend TAMA, the faster the supply decreases. Over time, that could lead to limited supply of TAMA relative to demand, potentially sending the price of the coin soaring. With such a high level of interest, Tamadoge has become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-trending-dextools-cryptos.htm">best trending DEXTools cryptos</a> on the market in 2023.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Battle Infinity &#8211; A Top Trending Coin for Metaverse Gaming</strong></h3>
<p>Battle Infinity is another new crypto token that many investors see a lot of potential in. This metaverse platform is seeking to build a multiverse within the metaverse.

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/219731/battle-infinity.jpg" alt="Battle Infinity Play To Earn Homepage" /></figure>
<p>For developers, that means an opportunity to earn crypto on a new and growing platform. For users, that means more things to do. For investors, it means more utility for Battle Infinity’s native crypto token, IBAT.</p>
<p>Battle Infinity is kicking things off with its own play-to-ean crypto game, IBAT Premier League. This is a fantasy sports game modeled on India’s Premier League for cricket. Players can assemble teams and compete against one another to score points based on how their players perform in real life. Winning players earn IBAT tokens, which they can exchange or spend throughout the Battle Infinity metaverse.</p>
<p>Battle Infinity  closed out one of the biggest crypto presales of 2022 and held a crypto ICO. The IBAT token is now available for anyone to buy and sell on the decentralized crypto exchange Pancakeswap. Currently, IBAT is trading at $0.0017 per token.

<p>The LBLOCK token also has appeal as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-undervalued-crypto.htm">most undervalued cryptos</a> because it can be used for staking and lending, creating additional ways for investors to potentially make money off this crypto token. NFT holders also earn crypto rewards &#8211; whenever a prize is released, NFT holders who don’t win receive a small piece of the prize pool as thanks for supporting the Lucky Block ecosystem.</p>
<p>Investors should also note that Lucky Block has a set of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nfts.htm">exclusive NFTs</a>, the Platinum Rollers Club NFT collection. These NFTs enter owners into a daily prize drawing for $10,000. There are only 10,000 Platinum Rollers Club NFTs available, so owners have a 1-in-10,000 chance of winning each day.</p>

<h3><strong>11. Ethereum &#8211; Second Largest Crypto Now with Proof of Stake</strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum is already the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. But this large-cap crypto is trending thanks to The Merge &#8211; Ethereum’s switch from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/219738/ethereum.jpg" alt="Official Ethereum Homepage" /></figure>
<p>With The Merge, huge sums of wealth in staked Ethereum will be released and the inflation rate of the token will drop dramatically, potentially increasing the coin’s value for current investors.</p>
<p>More broadly, Ethereum remains one of the most popular blockchains for developers building decentralized applications and Web3 platforms. Furthermore, it&#8217;s become one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-vr-crypto.htm">best VR cryptos</a> on the market as most virtual reality projects run on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum’s success at attracting developers means this coin has significant long-term potential, despite the advent of numerous ‘Ethereum killer’ blockchains that promise faster transaction speeds.</p>
<p>The only thing investors need to keep in mind when buying Ethereum is that the transaction fees for this blockchain can be steep. So, it’s a good idea to buy ETH from an exchange that offers low commissions or reduced gas fees.</p>

<h3><strong>12. Uniswap &#8211; Trending Crypto for the Largest Decentralized Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>Uniswap is one of the world’s largest decentralized crypto exchanges. It offers numerous incentives for UNI token holders, including voting rights over the future of the platform and a share of profits from the exchange’s fees. The UNI coin price has held up relatively well even during the crypto winter because of the enduring popularity of this token.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/219739/uniswap.jpg" alt="Swap, Earn, And Build With Uniswap Protocol" /></figure>
<p>While Uniswap faces competition from other decentralized exchanges like SushiSwap, it remains dominant when it comes to exchange transaction volume. Uniswap offers a huge variety of tokens, so it’s also the gateway for many crypto investors to buy new trending cryptos.</p>
<p>Another reason Uniswap is trending right now is that it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. So, significant changes to Ethereum as it switches to proof of stake could end up having benefits for the Uniswap platform as well. Many users on Reddit and Twitter have been hopeful that gas fees will come down, providing more incentive for crypto investors to turn to Uniswap for crypto transactions.</p>

<h3><strong>13. Fantom &#8211; Most Trending Crypto for Fast Transaction Processing</strong></h3>
<p>Fantom is a relatively new blockchain platform that was created with the purpose of providing faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum. It’s one of the fastest blockchains around, with a promised ability to process more than 300,000 transactions per second once the platform is fully developed.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/219737/fantom.jpg" alt="Fantom Website Homepage" /></figure>
<p>Fantom’s FTM token is one of the top trending cryptocurrencies today because it powers the Fantom blockchain ecosystem. FTM is used to pay for transaction fees for smart contracts and decentralized apps, for staking to the Fantom blockchain, for governance, and more. Importantly, investors who hold FTM can earn rewards by participating in the blockchain’s proof of stake transaction validation system.</p>
<p>Fantom currently has a market cap of over 1$ billion, so it has a long way to go to catch up to Ethereum. However, crypto investors on Twitter and Reddit are excited about this platform and the future potential of the FTM token.</p>

<h3><strong>14. Gala &#8211; Top Trending Cryptocurrency Today for Play-to-earn Gaming</strong></h3>
<p>The GALA token from Gala Games was one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of 2021. In that year, the value of GALA rose more than 50,000%. While the token has suffered along with the rest of the crypto market in recent months, investors don’t appear to be any less excited about this top trending crypto.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/219736/gala.jpg" alt="Gala Games Single Nodes For Sale" /></figure>
<p>The GALA token is the native token used for many of Gala Games’ play-to-earn crypto games, which include The Walking Dead: Empires, Legends Reborn, and many more. Players can earn GALA by winning games as well as by minting and selling their own NFTs within the Gala universe.</p>
<p>Gala Games currently operates most of its games on Ethereum, but it’s in the process of developing its own blockchain. When that happens, players will face lower transaction fees for using GALA. In the long run, Gala owning its own blockchain could allow the platform to generate more metaverse experiences and enhance the value of the GALA token.</p>

<h3><strong>15. ApeCoin &#8211; The Official Crypto of the Bored Apes Yacht Club</strong></h3>
<p>ApeCoin is a top trending crypto created by Yuga Labs, the creative team behind Bored Apes Yacht Club and several other ultra-popular NFT collections. The purpose of ApeCoin isn’t to replace Bored Apes, but rather to supplement the Apeverse with its own token for participants.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/219734/apecoin.jpg" alt="Apecoin Altcoin Webpage " /></figure>
<p>ApeCoin is trending because Yuga Labs is working on building its own metaverse, Otherside. There is widespread speculation that ApeCoin will be the official cryptocurrency of the Otherside virtual world and that land sales will be made in APE. If that happens, demand for ApeCoin could skyrocket and push up the price of this token with it.</p>
<p>Potential investors should keep in mind that this is purely speculative, as Yuga Labs has not announced what coins will be accepted in Otherside when it launches, making APE one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/12-most-volatile-cryptos-trade-invest-2022.htm">most volatile cryptos</a> on the market.</p>
<p>However, anticipation of ApeCoin’s future utility has propelled it to be a top trending crypto on Reddit.</p>

<h3><strong>16. LoopRing &#8211; Trending Coin that Lets Anyone Build Crypto Exchanges</strong></h3>
<p>LoopRing is a unique crypto project of the kind that often flies under the radar. However, this particular platform has caught the attention of crypto investors because it was recently endorsed by Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/87365/219735/loopring.jpg" alt="Loopring, an L2 ZK Rollup" /></figure>
<p>The purpose of LoopRing is to provide the infrastructure necessary for anyone to build a decentralized crypto exchange on the Ethereum blockchain. In the long run, democratizing access to exchange technology can bring down fees and make it easier for anyone to get access to new and trending cryptocurrencies. It could also make it much simpler for businesses of all types and sizes to accept cryptocurrency payments.</p>
<p>Many investors are excited about the LRC token, the native cryptocurrency of LoopRing, because it is deflationary. Around 10% of tokens used for transactions are burned and the total supply of LRC is capped. So, as demand for LRC grows, the price of the coin could potentially rise sharply.</p>
