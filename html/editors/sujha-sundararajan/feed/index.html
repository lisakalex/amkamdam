<p>Itaú Unibanco, Brazil&#8217;s largest private bank, has entered the crypto space with new trading service, per a Reuters report.</p>
<p>The lender would first launch <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ether</a> (ETH) trading for clients of its investment platform. The bank’s crypto division head Guto Antunes said in an interview that it is planning to add other cryptocurrency options soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It starts with bitcoin, but our overarching strategic plan is to expand to other crypto assets in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The support of other tokens trading would depend on the progression of crypto regulations within the country, Antunes noted.</p>
<p>The latest move by Brazil’s largest lender aligns with the increasing demand for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> services. The move also aligns with the global trend of traditional financial institutions incorporating crypto services.</p>
<p>Itau promises to stand out from its competitors like crypto exchange MB and investment bank BTG Pactual’s crypto unit, Mynt. Aside from local firms, the bank also faces competition from international platforms including Binance.</p>
<p>The announcement comes a month after two local entities, XP brokerage and financial services firm PicPay bowed out of the crypto market. PicPay attributed its departure to the crypto’s existing regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<h1>Demand for Crypto Services in Brazil</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/latin-america-cryptocurrency-adoption/">recent Chainalysis data</a> paints an optimistic picture for the Brazilian crypto market. Some crypto traders along with basic retail users were stuck to the asset class even during crypto winter.</p>
<p>Further, Brazilians display a higher demand for Bitcoin and altcoins, which are more typically used for long-term investment and speculation.</p>
<p>While the crypto regulatory environment evolves, Brazil is also experiencing substantial demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>This strong demand for crypto-related financial instruments suggests a rising interest in digital assets among Brazilian investors.</p>

<p>Standard Chartered Bank-backed digital assets custodian Zodia Custody, has integrated Metaco network’s global crypto storage services.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership is aimed at offering global sub-custody services for cryptocurrencies. This means that Metaco would store client’s funds and provide means to manage them including initiating transfers via web interface.</p>
<p>Zodia’s partnership aims to expand its services and reach a wider audience by providing safekeeping and settlement of digital assets. Zodia Custody CEO Julian Sawyer said Monday that the service gradually evolves to resemble how assets are stored in traditional finance.</p>
<p>“I think of this as the third generation of crypto custody, where multiple custodians are linked together,” he told CoinDesk. Sawyer further stressed that different types of networks are important in terms of linking custodians together in a compliant manner.</p>
<p>The integration comes a month after Zodia Custody <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-crypto-firm-zodia-launches-in-hong-kong.htm">expanded its services in Hong Kong</a> in response to institutional demand. In recent months, the company has already extended its services to Japan, Singapore, and Australia, proving its presence in the institutional crypto custody space.</p>
<h1>Digital Asset Custody Evolution</h1>
<p>Particularly after the FTX collapse last year, the crypto industry has been battling with a major lack of trust and transparency.</p>
<p>Zhu Kuang Lee, chief digital, data and innovation officer at HSBC said last month that there has been an “increasing demand for custody and fund administration of digital assets from asset managers and asset owners, as this market continues to evolve.”</p>
<p>HSBC announced in November, its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hsbc-announces-plans-to-launch-digital-asset-custody-service-in-partnership-with-metaco.htm">plans to launch a custody service</a> for storing blockchain-based assets excluding cryptocurrency in 2024. The financial services giant has also planned its partnership with Metaco to carry out the services.</p>
<p>Swiss-based firm Metaco leverages <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">Ripple</a>’s (XRP) scale and market strength to reach to clients at a faster pace. Ripple acquired Metaco early this year in a first major acquisition for $250 million.</p>

<p>Nexo, a lending platform that provides instant crypto loans, has partnered with Koinly to simplify user’s tax reporting.</p>
<p><a href="https://koinly.io/integrations/nexo/">Effective November 30</a>, 2023, the collaboration enables Nexo users to easily generate tailored crypto tax reports. A company statement said that the partnership will streamline the crypto tax reporting and preparation of financial statements.</p>
<p>Further, Koinly allows Nexo users to cater to their specific transaction histories and tax obligations through the Nexo app. Nexo clients can also access custom country-wise tax reports for over 100 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Koinly reflects our dedication to providing holistic financial solutions and empowering our clients to make informed financial decisions,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and Managing Partner of Nexo.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company noted that the service automates accurate tax reports, simplifying tax complications and reducing human error. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/nexo/">Nexo</a> users can avail the service for free up to 800 transactions annually. For users exceeding this transaction volume, a 30% discount is offered on Koinly.</p>
<p>The news comes months after Nexo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nexo-launches-a-crypto-powered-debit-and-credit-mastercard-for-the-european-economic-area-eea.htm">launched</a> a crypto-powered debit and credit MasterCard for users in the European Economic Area. Dubbed the <a href="https://nexo.com/nexo-card">Nexo “Dual Mode Crypto”</a> Card offers a variety of features including the ability to optimize tax responsibilities.</p>
<h1>Simplification of Crypto Taxation</h1>
<p>With the growth of Web3 activity, accounting for crypto gains and losses is becoming a common pain point for users and businesses alike. According to a July <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/07/05/crypto-poses-significant-tax-problems-and-they-could-get-worse">IMF report</a>, the most fundamental difficulty in taxing crypto assets is that they are “pseudonymous.”</p>
<p>For instance, Web3 firms need to track transactions across multiple blockchains and wallets to properly report crypto gains and losses on their business tax returns. This requires deep blockchain data integrations.</p>
<p>Adam Saville Brown, Head of Partnerships at Koinly, highlighted that the collaboration is a milestone for simplification of crypto taxes.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The collaboration aligns with Koinly’s mission to service the tax needs of crypto investors and with Nexo’s innovative approach in the crypto financial services sector.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nexo is also planning to launch educational materials on cryptocurrency tax reporting, the statement added.</p>

<p>American banking giant JPMorgan has shed light of optimism in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) sectors.</p>
<p>A JPMorgan report published Thursday revealed notable revival in the DeFi and NFT activity, spurred by an improved crypto markets sentiment. Titled ‘Resurgence in DeFi and NFTs: A Market Shift,’ the study attributes the resurgence to the recent US <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ETF expectations.</p>
<p>The report stressed DeFi and NFT market recovery, though positive in recent times, are only “tentative signs of revival.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“While there is no doubt that the recent resurgence in DeFi/NFT activity is a positive sign, it is too early to get excited about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A team of analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted that the increase comes nearly after two years of market decline. “Thus, creating some optimism that the worst might be behind us in terms of the medium-term trajectory for DeFi/NFT activity.”</p>
<h1>Increased Trading Activity in Decentralized Exchanges</h1>
<p>The analysts further wrote that some DeFi recovery is “natural,” given the rise in trading activity in decentralized exchanges (DEX).</p>
<p>DEXs are rapidly gaining popularity in the crypto world for their emphasis on user control, privacy and security. According to <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs">DefiLlama</a>, trading volume on DEXs rose to $133.1 billion in March 2023, the third straight monthly increase.</p>
<p>Further, liquid staking by Lido has also contributed to the improvement in DeFi since early 2023, the JPMorgan report noted. Lido (LDO) liquid staking solution for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> allows users to earn staking rewards without locking assets.</p>
<p>The analysts also pointed out Ether (ETH), which has underperformed other cryptos, impacting the total value locked (TVL) measurement. This “would mechanically show some revival given the price of several smaller cryptocurrencies has risen by more than ether in recent months,” they added.</p>
<p>However, the emergence of new blockchains, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms is seen as encouraging, the bank said. Ethereum blockchain still faces issues like “network scalability, low transaction speeds and higher fees,” despite the rise in DeFi.</p>

<p>Decentralized network <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/algo-algorand/">Algorand</a> (ALGO) has partnered with key players in India to deepen India’s Web3 foundation.</p>
<p>In a significant move explained by the blockchain platform’s CEO Staci Warden, Algorand will partner with the Indian tech advocacy group – NASSCOM.</p>
<p>Other partners include TiE Bangalore, a global entrepreneurship supporting program, and India’s first women-centric bank – the Mann Deshi Foundation.</p>
<p>Warden told CoinDesk in an interview that the collaboration will foster Web3 capabilities under NASSCOM’s FutureSkills Prime skilling hub. The hub is a digital skilling initiative, developed in partnership with the IT industry, academia and government.</p>
<p>Further, Algorand will also develop a blockchain-based credit scorecard and identity system for women entrepreneurs of the Mann Deshi Foundation. The collaboration with TiE Bangalore will enable Algorand to provide educational initiatives to support the Indian Web3 ecosystem, Warden added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In just a year, our strategic collaborations and innovative blockchain solutions with key players (in India) have pioneered financial inclusion, with the potential for impacting millions of lives in underserved communities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Algorand India’s country head Anil Kakani noted that the firm is aiming to have organizational partnerships to deepen the Web3. It is also working on partnerships to build Web3 use cases in India.</p>
<p>Kakani stressed that Algorand won’t go to regulators with recommendations, however, it is anticipating India’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) launch.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We want to see how we can build on that but as a protocol, our heavy focus is real-world utility.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>AlgoBharat</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Algorand Foundation entered India with its new project “AlgoBharat” in March, aiming to support India’s foray into the Web3 space.</p>
<p>At the time, Algorand partnered with the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) to support women-led enterprises in building blockchain solutions. It also joined hands with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and the Indian School of Business to launch faculty development programs.</p>
<p>Kakani said at the time that the company has been understanding the appetite for Web3 in India. “We will certainly engage with regulators this year,” he mentioned.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a> is reportedly facing challenges in Thailand ahead of its plans to launch a new crypto platform with billionaire Sarath Ratanavadi’s Gulf Energy.</p>
<p>The beleaguered exchange, which is currently facing criminal charges and civil lawsuits in the US, is under scrutiny in Thailand.</p>
<p>The regulatory challenges have risen in the jurisdiction due to Binance’s recent incidents including a $4.3 billion settlement with the US authorities and CEO Changpeng Zhao’s guilty plea and stepping down from the board.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/crypto-exchange-binance-s-reboot-faces-test-in-thailand">Bloomberg</a>, Sarath Ratanavadi said that Binance wasn’t accused of fraud or misappropriating customer assets in the US settlement. Gulf Energy holds a 51% stake in the planned crypto exchange, while Binance holds the minority stake.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Binance grew extremely fast and so probably crossed paths with some regulations. We have much more confidence in its credibility after this storm, which should make it a lot stronger.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The domestic Binance-Gulf Energy joint venture would likely delay its launch, following the scrutiny. The global exchange is now headed by CEO Richard Teng, former chief executive of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.</p>
<p>Ratanavadi noted that Thailand’s regulator Securities &amp; Exchange Commission is “very strict” and asked a lot of questions about Binance, before approval. He added that his firm chose Binance due to its market-leading position.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Binance is also undergoing an accusation from the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission for operating without a license. The regulator noted that the world’s largest crypto exchange lacks authorization to sell securities in the country.</p>
<p>The regulator <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-in-philippines-binance-is-operating-without-a-license-heres-the-latest.htm">issued a warning</a> to Filipinos on Wednesday to exercise utmost caution while dealing with such unregistered exchanges.</p>

<p>The co-founder of the crypto-focused VC firm Electric Capital, Avichal Garg, has warned investors over a potential disguised crypto scam.</p>
<p>The early-stage VC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1968099/000196809923000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">that raised</a> $300 million for its third fund in September, is now being targeted by crypto scammers.</p>
<p>According to Garg’s warning, the perpetrators are masquerading as representatives of Electric Capital, setting up meetings. They then lure individuals to send money before investing, he added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately, scammers are pretending to be <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectricCapital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ElectricCapital</a>, setting up meetings, and asking people to send them money before investing.</p>
<p>Electric Capital will *never* ask you to send money before receiving an investment. </p>
<p>We will never reach out cold via Telegram. We almost…</p>
<p>&mdash; Avichal &#8211; Electric ϟ Capital (@avichal) <a href="https://twitter.com/avichal/status/1729263598776836601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p>“Ultimately this is a social engineering attack, so there will always be an angle the scammers will try to take. It will likely get worse in the height of the next bull market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Among crypto scams, social engineering attack is used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, crypto wallets and accounts. Such attacks include phishing mail, baiting, pretexting, among others.</p>
<p>Further, Garg stressed that the company would never ask users to send money in advance, before receiving an investment.</p>
<p>He clarified that the Palo Alto-headquartered firm has only limited official communication channels. “We only send emails from the electriccapital.com” domain, he said.</p>
<p>To prevent such impersonation, Electric Capital is working on additional verifications on social media channels, Garg further reassured investors.</p>
<h2>Fund Falsely Represented as “Electric”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A recent <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/threat-intelligence-reports">cyber threat intelligence report</a> by financial advisory firm Kroll revealed that there has been an increase in social engineering scam tactics in 2023 compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Garg explained to users in another post that these scammers do actual diligence, disguising to be from Electric Capital. They then lure prospective victims to become limited partners (LP) in bogus “Electric” fund and ask them to send money.</p>
<p>“Once diligence is done and founder is an LP in Electric, they will get investment,” he added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since people are asking how the scam works:<br />&#8211; scammers pretend to be EC &amp; do actual diligence (!)<br />&#8211; scammers tell the founder to become an LP into an &quot;Electric&quot; fund and to send money<br />&#8211; claim that once diligence is done and founder is an LP in Electric, they will get investment</p>
<p>&mdash; Avichal &#8211; Electric ϟ Capital (@avichal) <a href="https://twitter.com/avichal/status/1729266632437256321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Garg’s warning comes shortly following a <a href="https://twitter.com/defendersdao/status/1729321256556847308">SIM swap attack</a> on the smart contract security marketplace Code4arena&#8217;s X account, on Monday. Hackers posted a scam airdrop on its X account, which reportedly announced ARENA tokens airdrop endorsed by VC firm Paradigm.</p>

<p>Former Governor of China’s central bank PBOC is all optimistic about the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) nearing completion.</p>
<p>Speaking at a conference in Honng Kong on Monday, Zhou Xiaochuan, the 75-year Chinese economist, said that a ‘digital yuan’ is “already on track” and the “final stage is not very far away.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ninety percent of retail payments in China are already digitalized. There is only 10 percent left to do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The significant stride from the ex-governor, comes days after the central bank released a <a href="http://zj.people.com.cn/n2/2023/1125/c186327-40654676.html">white paper</a> on cross-border e-CNY solution.</p>
<p>Zhou delivered the key-note address at the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, stressing the importance of digital currencies. He said that after China debuted on its CBDC in 2019, the project has seen high transactions and total value.</p>
<p>He highlighted challenges including mobility and convertibility of digital currencies, data protection and privacy issues, that the bank would deep-dive.</p>
<p>Zhao has been the longest-serving Governor of PBOC, with 16 years of tenure. His remarks on digital currencies and CBDC reflects China’s commitment towards digital payments innovation. Particularly at a time when other jurisdictions face increasing interest rates and rising inflation.</p>
<p>The conference was organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Over 20 incumbent central bank governors, deputy governors and former governors attended the meeting. The current Governor of PBOC, Pan Gongsheng, also delivered a keynote speech on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Governors from financial institutions across the globe, including Australia, Spain, England and Thailand attended the event. Some of the topics discussed at the conference include financial stability, inflation and labor markets.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Chinese arm of the Standard Chartered Bank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-to-participate-in-trials-of-chinas-digital-yuan-cbdc-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">joined China’s digital yuan trials</a>. The bank said that it is collaborating with City Bank Clearing Services to provide access to the CBDC’s interconnection platform.</p>

<p>Crypto platform OKX announced its official launch in Brazil, offering users with advanced crypto features including trading and staking rewards.</p>
<p>The roll-out would feature a Web3 wallet in Brazil, providing a secured and trusted gateway to DeFi and crypto trading.</p>
<p>The company said in a  Monday <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/okx-officially-launches-crypto-exchange-and-web3-wallet-in-brazil-301997640.html">official release</a>, that it would provide trading with Brazilian real fiat-on ramp capabilities.</p>
<p>“We know that Brazilians expect fast and liquid trading, along with a secure self-custody wallet solution, all in one app,” said OKX Brazil General Manager Guilherme Sacamone.</p>
<p>The news comes days after the crypto exchange applied for a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) license in Hong Kong. OKX became the first major industry player to apply in Hong Kong under the new crypto regime.</p>
<h2>Wallet Features</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
OKX President Hong Fang said that the OKX wallet comes with a slew of features including easy access to DeFi, NFTs, dApps and more.</p>
<p>Further, the wallet features both Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology and Account Abstraction (AA) features, which helps in wider adoption among non-technical users.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We look forward to driving innovation and growth of the Web3 and crypto economy with millions of users as the market matures in Brazil.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent study conducted by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/okex/">OKX exchange</a> revealed that Brazilians found security as the major concern. Among the responders, 92% urged for a clear and transparent security regulations for their investments. Over 85% voted for proof of reserves (PoR) as a legitimate way of verifying customer assets held by a crypto exchange.</p>
<p>“Given the results of our recent survey, we also recognize that security and transparency are top priorities for crypto users in the country,” says Sacamone.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Therefore, OKX provides its trading solutions with the best security features, such as our robust Proof of Reserves program.”</p></blockquote>

<p>North Korea’s state-backed hacking group ‘Kimsuky,’ is supposedly behind a cryptocurrency heist, where hackers disguised as South Korean government agencies.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2023-11-22/national/northKorea/Norths-hackers-pose-as-officials-journalists-to-steal-info-and-crypto/1919045">local report</a>, hackers impersonated as South Korean journalists, government agencies and research institutes. Between March and October 2023, a total of 1,468 people fell victim to the crypto hackers, the local police confirmed.</p>
<p>The victims included 57 incumbent or retired government officials in diplomacy, military and national security. The rest 1,411 victims were working in the private sector, the report added.</p>
<p>“The police will work closely with relevant institutions and agencies to continuously track down North Korea’s cyber-attacks and breaches to prevent losses,” a police officer noted.</p>
<h2>Phishing Mails Sent</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The South Korean National Police Agency said that the perpetrators sent phishing mails to execute the dubious act. These mails pretended to be sent from South Korean government agencies including the National Police Agency, National Health Insurance Service, National Pension Service and National Tax Service.</p>
<p>Further, it contained ‘clickbait’ – a link encouraging visitors to click to a particular web page – with words like notice, questionnaire. Once victims open the scam mail or attached files, the hackers infest computers with a malware, police explained.</p>
<p>The malware then stole victims’ personal information and cryptocurrency. “Illegal cyber activity was aimed at stealing cryptocurrency,” they added.</p>
<p>According to the police data, attackers stole ID’s and profile information of 19 victims to access their crypto trading accounts. Additionally, they seized 147 proxy servers to carry out crypto mining programs.</p>
<p>The police have closed 42 phishing websites operated by the North Korean hacker group to prevent further loss.</p>
<p>The North Korean Kimsuky hacker group operates under the country’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea’s foreign intelligence agency. South Korea government sanctioned Kimsuky in June.</p>

<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is reportedly ramping up its surveillance towards the crypto market introducing fresh warnings.</p>
<p>The regulator on Friday issued warning on cryptocurrency investments criticizing the digital tokens as “created out of nothing.” ASIC chair Joseph Longo also slammed the beleaguered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a> exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao over its unclear structure.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s basically created out of nothing, out of the ether – it’s basically computer code.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/companies/asics-new-cryptocurrency-warnings-australia-ahead-of-new-federal-government-laws-coming/news-story/41845cb7da51de2136a8d869c9a8572d?amp&amp;nk=092d4788ba5e7a85f321b9284c053a5a-1700796636">report</a> by an Australian daily, ASIC issued strict crypto warnings and would tighten its cryptocurrency laws by 2025. A new legislation, paying attention to the risks of cryptos will be introduces soon, it said.</p>
<p>“The whole crypto story to my mind remains one that we should be very, very, very cautious about,” Longo said.</p>
<p>He also stressed that many digital tokens are not traded in a way which isn’t transparent and the processes are opaque.</p>
<p>Further, Longo also raised concerns on those investors who can’t afford to lose their money on cryptos. “But I do worry about people who think that it’s an activity that you could equate with superannuation or having a mortgage or buying some property.”</p>
<p>Longo added that cryptos remained on AISC’s radar with four legal cases currently underway.</p>
<p>“My key message remains: be careful before you put your money into crypto,” he warned. “The other reason I worry about crypto is that you can trade crypto anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>The warning and the new legislation on cryptos come at a time when 906,000 Aussies said that they are likely to enter the crypto market for the first time in next 12months, according to Australian Digital Assets Survey, 2023.</p>
<p>Longo further said that once the legislation passes the parliament, ASIC will get extra funding to tackle crypto.</p>
<h2>Binance is “Opaque”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Furthermore, Longo mentioned the opaque and unclear structure of Binance as the exchange faces trouble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the recent stepping down of its CEO CZ.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I mean, look at Binance – where are they based? We still don’t know. So, what am I dealing with?”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court, crypto regulations in Australia has two factors – design and ways to enforce it.</p>
<p>“Crypto has been a really critical part of the enforcement that we’ve been doing this year,” she noted. “If we see misconduct though that raises significant issues in the same way as these other cases then absolutely we will continue to prioritize and take enforcement action.”</p>

<p>Crypto and asset tokenization platform TokenFi announced a new Token Launcher that simplifies token creation on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Goerli chain.</p>
<p>The innovative token creation service will allow users to generate tokens “without touching a line of code.” This means that users can customize token parameters without any coding skills. This is essential in the industry where token creation demands technical expertise and lack of which often limit participation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TOKENFI TOKEN LAUNCHER AND TOKENFI QUICKLAUNCH BOT ARE LIVE ON TESTNET</p>
<p>You can now officially create tokens in just a few clicks and without touching a line of code with TokenFi Token Launcher and TokenFi QuickLaunch Bot on the Ethereum Goerli chain! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokenFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TokenFi</a> Token Launcher… <a href="https://t.co/BsiRijIcIJ">pic.twitter.com/BsiRijIcIJ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Token Launcher can be used via any desktop or mobile-based web browser,” the announcement read.</p>
<p>With the launch of the new Token Launcher service, the subsidiary of Floki Inu aims to create digital asset tokenization more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Further, the news comes at a time when TokenFi is facing challenges from Bitget Exchange. Bitget delisted TokenFi’s digital asset TOKEN, accusing the company of potential market manipulation and opaque vesting schedule.</p>
<p>Bitget said early this month that TokenFi “maliciously controlled the initial liquidity” of the token, following significant price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The offshoot of Floki Inu, TokenFi, also shared an official video tutorial on how to create crypto tokens on the Ethereum Goerli testnet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Introducing TokenFi QuickLaunch Bot</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Additionally, TokenFi also launched TokenFi QuickLaunch Bot, which is integrated into popular communication platforms including Telegram and Discord. It offers an innovative and streamlined approach to token creation.</p>
<p>Integrating with social media platforms, QuickLaunch Bot taps into its existing user bases, bringing in a new audience to the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The TOKEN price has seen a noticeable fluctuation following the announcement. The crypto prices showed a slight surge, proving its optimistic response. TOKEN is trading at $0.0273 at press time.</p>

<p>Sam Altman, the ousted OpenAI founder, will return back to run the company as the CEO under a new board.</p>
<p>In a bizarre reversal drama, the co-founder of the leading generative artificial intelligence startup will rejoin the company, days after he was pushed out of it.</p>
<p>Per a post on X (Twitter) on Wednesday, the company confirmed that it had “reached an agreement in principle for Sam to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board.”</p>
<p>The initial board will be led by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Other directors include Larry Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary, and existing member Adam D’Angelo.</p>
<p>“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” the post read.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Altman left OpenAI on November 17, following an unusual company structure that weakened his position as the CEO. However, the AI entrepreneur joined software behemoth Microsoft soon after.</p>
<p>In a separate post by Altman, he noted that he is looking forward to rejoining OpenAI and building a strong partnership with Microsoft.</p>
<p>“I love OpenAI, and everything I’ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together,” he wrote.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Easy Crypto’s co-founder and CEO Janine Grainger wrote that the NZDD stablecoin offers a <a href="https://hub.easycrypto.com/news/new-zealand-largest-crypto-retailer-launches-kiwi-stablecoin-and-crypto-wallet">stable entry into the digital marketplace</a>. It embraces the trustworthiness of the New Zealand Dollar with all the benefits of blockchain, she added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Everything is going digital – including currency – but what makes many people hesitate is the stability of these assets. We wanted to change this by offering a trusted NZ dollar-backed stablecoin that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital age.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, Grainger noted that only 10% of the New Zealand population owns crypto assets. Some of the key barriers restricting the rest of the population from getting involved include volatility and complexity.</p>
<p>“we’re focused on solving these challenges as digitization grows,” she said. “Kiwis need a seamless onramp to crypto.”</p>
<h2>New Self-Custody Wallet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Alongside, the announcement also embarked a new multicurrency self-custody wallet, which acts as “one wallet for all your crypto.” The wallet comes with unlimited sub-wallets, multiple blockchains and a broad breadth of coins backed by state-of-the-art security.</p>
<p>“Managing your crypto shouldn’t be daunting; and you certainly shouldn’t need a collection of different wallets,” explains Grainger.</p>
<p>The wallet also allows users to import and safely manage multiple accounts within the same wallet. Additionally, users will have the option to buy and sell assets from over 50 of the most popular cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>There are also cutting-edge security and recovery features such as multi-party computation (MPC). This feature helps in recovering wallet keys should you lose it, says Grainger.</p>

<p>Fashion behemoth Nike has pre-launched new RTFKT Dunk Genesis sneakers that do not require an expensive NFT to buy.</p>
<p>The public presale of the new real-world kicks <a href="https://dunks.rtfkt.com/">went live on Monday</a>, letting anyone buy the sneakers without owning an RTFKT non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The drop is now live. The <a href="https://twitter.com/RTFKT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RTFKT</a> x Nike Dunk Ghost and Void editions are now available for pre-order at <a href="https://t.co/nVV3ffzdjv">https://t.co/nVV3ffzdjv</a>.</p>
<p>Oops, you stepped into the future! <a href="https://t.co/g28DMjV3wK">pic.twitter.com/g28DMjV3wK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nike (@Nike) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1726632131705876835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The website noted that Dunk Genesis is designed with creators, gaming and internet culture. Further, the sneakers are equipped with removable mods and interchangeable vial attachments.</p>
<p>The phase 1 pre-sale live drop has ended on November 20 with two drop times. The RTFKT x Nike Dunk Genesis comes in two editions – Void and Ghost – which are sold at $222 a pair.</p>
<p>The Void edition shipping will take place before July 31, 2024, while the Ghost edition will ship before August, 31.</p>
<p>Additionally, the new launch is associated with t-shirts for the collab with both brand logos and a quote written in the front &#8211; “Oops, You Stepped Into the Future.”</p>
<p>The website confirmed that these are not digital collectibles and are real physical sneakers that are made-to-order.</p>
<h2>Embedded NFC Tags: What Are They?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The latest launch of Nike’s new RTFKT Dunk Genesis sneakers is tied to NFTs with an embedded near-field communication (NFC) chip within the sneakers.</p>
<p>These tags “will allow for the redemption of a digital collectible, however, this is an optional experience,” it noted.</p>
<p>It is unclear on which chain will Nike and RTFKT use to mint the associated NFT collectibles. RTFKT has previously been minted on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH).</p>
<p>The launch comes after both companies launched the RTFKT x Nike Air Force 1 sneakers earlier this year. The purchase of the previous version required an NFT to redeem for the real-world shoes. Another notable launch of sneakers required an Ethereum NFT to buy shoes.</p>

<p>Blockchain Association, the crypto advocacy group, has filed an amicus brief with the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).</p>
<p>The Association has criticized the agency’s decision to sanction crypto mixer Tornado Cash, pointing out the regulatory repercussions.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FILE-STAMPED-23-50669-Amicus-Brief.pdf">brief filed on Monday</a>, the Association argued that OFAC’s actions toward the privacy-protecting software Tornado Cash are “unlawful.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“We argue that OFAC’s actions are unlawful, exceed statutory authority, and are arbitrary and capricious, running contrary to the Constitution.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/blockchainassociation-files-second-amicus-brief-in-office-of-foreign-assets-control-lawsuit-against-tornado-cash/">official statement</a> read that this is the first time OFAC has sanctioned computer software instead of individuals or entities. This amicus brief is the second filing following a district court brief filed in April.</p>
<h2>Blockchain Association Defends Second Time</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the April brief, the Blockchain Association defended Tornado Cash describing it as simply a tool. The platform is a self-executing computer software protocol embedded in the Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">ETH</a>) blockchain.</p>
<p>Further, the software has no owner or operator, and is entirely decentralized unlike OFAC’s claims, it added. However, if OFAC succeeds in the sanctions, it would weaken the digital asset industry.</p>
<p>Blockchain Association Senior Counsel Marisa Coppel notes that the actions by OFAC are “dangerous,” exceeding their authority. The sanctions also jeopardize American’s right to privacy, she added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“OFAC must see Tornado Cash for what it is: a tool that can be used by anyone. Rather than sanctioning a tool with a lawful purpose, OFAC should remain focused on the bad actors that misuse such tools.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The OFAC sanctioned the victual currency mixer Tornado Cash on August 8, 2022, for allowing hackers to launder $7 billion. The agency accused the platform of failing to install sufficient controls to prevent it from laundering cash for bad actors.</p>
<p>Per the accusations, the laundered assets include $445 million hacked by the North Korean notorious hacker – Lazarus Group.</p>

<p>The State of Jersey Police brought a crypto investment fraud to light that resulted in losses amounting to £700,000 ($873K). Jersey police issued a warning to the islanders to be vigilant about cryptocurrency scams.</p>
<p>The British isle issued a <a href="https://jersey.police.uk/news-appeals/2023/november/cryptocurrency-investment-fraud/">cautionary note</a> to residents to be aware of crypto investment fraud.</p>
<p>“We want to supply as much information as we can about online crypto frauds, how the fraudsters work, and what to look out for if you’re thinking of investing in crypto.”</p>
<p>The warning comes following an online crypto fraud resulting in losses of £700,000 to one islander.</p>
<p>“This is in addition to previous crypto fraud reports, brings the total financial loss reported this year alone to £1.8 million,” the warning read.</p>
<p>It stated the nature of crypto scams and how perpetrators take advantage of the anonymity and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. It stressed how scammers use persuasive language to convince customers by using legitimate-looking websites.</p>
<p>States of Jersey police raised a few red flags to identify a crypto fraud, including pressured sales tactics, unrealistic growth, high return guarantee, among others.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s virtually impossible to get any money back after you have fallen victim to crypto fraud.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Scammers Use High-Pressure Tactics</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A joint report by the States of Jersey Police and Joint Financial Crimes Unit in February noted that over £600,000 were lost in the past three months to crypto investment frauds.</p>
<p>The heist was a &#8220;complex webs of deceit&#8221; through adverts and fake social media accounts, the report said. Scammers used high-pressure tactics to convince victims to invest in fake crypto schemes.</p>
<p>&#8220;They target all sectors of society and encourage people to invest life savings in high-risk products without understanding the risks involved,&#8221; said investigating officer Faith Shalamon, at the time.</p>

<p>Taipei-based trading platform, Kronos Research has suffered a cybersecurity breach, leading to a staggering $26 million loss in crypto assets.</p>
<p>The hack was first reported by crypto on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, mapping out the fund outflow and confirming its magnitude.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1726015231023796233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Following the ZachXBT post, the platform acknowledged on Sunday that there was unauthorized access to some of its API keys. The security breach has apparently led to a loss of over $26 million worth of Ether (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">ETH</a>).</p>
<p>The incident has forced Kronos to halt all trading operations and launch a full-scale investigation. The company also noted that this is the first trading suspension since 2018 and aims to recover the loses quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘’We paused all trading while we conduct an investigation. Potential losses are not a significant portion of our equity and we aim to resume trading as soon as possible.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The platform assured users that Kronos remains in good standing despite losses. “All losses will be covered internally, no partners will be affected,” it <a href="https://twitter.com/ResearchKronos/status/1726203104801042583">added</a>.</p>
<p>The breach follows the recent notable attack faced by the crypto exchange platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-security-firm-peckshield-reports-suspicious-activity-in-poloniex-exchange-wallet-60-million-drained.htm">Poloniex</a>, resulting in losses over $100 million.</p>
<h2>The Ripple Effect</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto exchange WOO X felt the repercussions of this breach, pausing its operations temporarily. This is because Kronos uses the WOO platform and functions as the market maker for spot and perpetual futures market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, in an hour, WOO resumed spot and perpetual trading activities and asset withdrawals. The exchange also flagged a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on its website on the same day.</p>
<p>“We are taking steps with adjusting CloudFlare to mitigate future outages. Trading currently remains operational, all users funds are safe and withdrawals remain open,” it said.</p>
<p>The online crypto community criticized the attacks, raising questions on the relationship between both firms. One user compared the unclear connection of Kronos and WOO to that of FTX and Alameda Research.</p>

<p>Ukrainian lawmakers and officials have received advanced training on identifying and investigating crypto-related financial crimes. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities have organized the 4-day course.</p>
<p>Fourteen law enforcement and supervisory officials from Ukraine underwent the training from 14 to 17 November 2023 in Vienna. Per a <a href="https://www.osce.org/oceea/558054">press release</a>, the course involved advanced techniques and the practical use of investigative tools to identify crypto-related crimes.</p>
<p>Ralf Ernst, Acting Co-ordinator of OSCE said that this is the second training on investigation of cryptocurrencies for Ukrainian officials.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With the growing use of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies in Ukraine, there is a pressing need to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement and supervisory bodies. This is essential for effective investigations, enhancing Ukraine&#8217;s resilience against money laundering and other financial crimes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the training also focused on advanced tracing of criminal transactions on different blockchains through case studies. Participants had an opportunity to familiarize themselves with specialized analytics software, the release added.</p>
<p>The troubled nation racked up $225 million worth of donations in cryptocurrencies alone, since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion.</p>
<p>The OSCE has been conducting a project on “Innovative policy solutions to mitigate money-laundering risks of virtual assets.”</p>
<p>Countries including the US, UK, Germany, Poland and Romania funds the project. It supports governments of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in training national authorities on crypto-related criminal risks and mitigating methods.</p>
<p>In September, the IRS Criminal Investigation offered a <a href="https://therecord.media/irs-dutch-us-teach-ukraine-sanctions">similar course</a> on money laundering, fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions and blockchain forensic investigations. Officials from various countries including the US and Netherlands attended the training.</p>

<p>Asset manager WisdomTree is attempting to resubmit a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) despite previous rejections.</p>
<p>The company filed an amendment with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This just means WisdomTree is still planning to launch an ETF and is in talks with the SEC’s corp fin division.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">UPDATE: Theres the S-1/Prospectus amendment for <a href="https://twitter.com/WisdomTreeFunds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WisdomTreeFunds</a>’s spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> ETF <a href="https://t.co/RKzWbuKnl1">pic.twitter.com/RKzWbuKnl1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; James Seyffart (@JSeyff) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1725225523574382821?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Dubbed S-1, the revised filing comes amid increased interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. The U.S. crypto firm NYDIG estimates demand for a spot Bitcoin ETF at around $30 billion.</p>
<p>Seyffart noted that there is nothing critical in the filling as all issuers are expected to file with the regulator. “Just a step in the process. Nothing critical,” he added.</p>
<p>Mainstream investment giants BlackRock and Fidelity, along with crypto-focused companies like Grayscale have each filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. However, the SEC has not yet approved a spot Bitcoin ETF application.</p>
<p>According to experts and crypto market speculators, the first approval could come early in 2024. Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar, notes that for ETF investors, this would be the “best product on the market.”</p>
<h2>WisdomTree Bets on Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
WisdomTree has faced rejections from the SEC over its Bitcoin ETF filings previously. The SEC rejected WisdomTree’s previous applications in 2021 and 2022 noting that the filings were short of investor protections.</p>
<p>However, WisdomTree’s Jeremy Schwartz believes that the changes made in the filings would satisfy regulators. In July, Schwartz noted that the firm has been successfully able to launch products in Europe.</p>
<p>“The European regulators have been more friendly, and they’ve been able to get comfortable with the mechanisms, the custodians [and] how the markets work,” he said at the time.</p>
