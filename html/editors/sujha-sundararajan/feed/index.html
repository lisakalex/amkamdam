<p>Smart wallet infrastructure provider Safe is partnering to launch a curated suite of crypto recovery options, dubbed “Safe Recovery Hub.”</p>
<p>The service is offered in collaboration with global digital asset banking group Sygnum Bank and the UK-regulated recovery service provider – CoinCover.</p>
<p>Per a company statement, the crypto recovery hub offers a wide range of options including self-custodial, social recovery, among others.</p>
<p>The service enables users to optimize a key recovery solution to fit their personal risk preferences, explains Lukas Schor, co-founder at Safe. This addresses the challenges in the existing complex key management, where users have few recovery options available.</p>
<p>Safe Recovery Hub users can recover access to their digital asset accounts through “recoverers,” which are family members and friends. In addition, third-party service providers like Sygnum Bank and CoinCover are designated as recoverers in order to facilitate recovery.</p>
<p>Only users give access and control to the recoverers in case of a recovery event, even in a custodial setup. At other times, users retain full control and have the right to cancel any recovery attempt, the company statement read.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This user-driven module, where account holders dictate the terms of asset management themselves, is unprecedented both in the crypto industry and traditional finance, marking a new milestone in the path towards financial sovereignty.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a GitHub post, more than 900,000 ETH (worth $1.92 billion) were inaccessible to users, with forgotten keys. Thomas Eichenberger, Chief Product Officer at Sygnum Bank emphasizes the growing need for reliable institutional recovery solutions in such cases.</p>
<p>“This partnership to build a dynamic and secure recovery solution reflects our commitment to meet the evolving needs of institutional investors,” Eichenberger added.</p>
<p>The Safe Recovery Hub will be available to users of Safe wallet. However, services from partner companies will debut in the first half of 2024.</p>

<p>Vancouver-based blockchain infrastructure provider LayerZero Labs is coming up with its native token launch in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the company noted that it has heard the crypto community’s speculation regarding the lack of communication on the token launch.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ll state now in no uncertain terms that there will be a LayerZero token. Its distribution is something we’re committed to getting right and expect it to happen within the first half of 2024.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">LayerZero has always been built with the ability to have a native token within the protocol, as can be seen in the immutable code launched on day 1. We’ve heard the community discussion over the last few months and the lack of clear communication around this. We’ll state now in…</p>
<p>&mdash; LayerZero Labs (@LayerZero_Labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1732862812710449466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Early this year, LayerZero Labs <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/layerzero-raises-120m-in-funding-to-expand-cross-chain-messaging-efforts-is-the-bull-market-back.htm">raised $120 million</a> in a Series B funding round to expand its cross-chain messaging efforts. The funding round saw several prominent crypto-focused venture capitalists including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Sequoia Capital, Circle Ventures, and OKX Ventures.</p>
<p>The LayerZero platform allows developers to create projects on multiple blockchains, without any intermediary to handle the cross-chain interactions. The platform connects more than 30 mainnet blockchains including Solana, Aptos and non-Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs).</p>
<p>In a separate blog, LayerZero noted that it has allocated $3 million of ZRO tokens to a distribution pool for the community. In the upcoming token airdrop, user addresses with over 10 transactions on the Ethereum mainnet this year are eligible to receive funds.</p>
<p>ZRO <a href="https://medium.com/@BestAirdropsToday495861/layerzero-airdrop-instruction-claim-350-in-zro-token-for-everyone-d327a1786167">token price speculation</a> suggests that it is currently available in the private sales round within the range of $2.35 to $4.50 per token. If this prediction holds true, even a small amount of the airdrop token would be valued more.</p>
<p>The team in September gave a hint on its GitHub code that the token is likely to be launched in the future.</p>

<p>LayerZero underpins Stargate, which allows assets to be bridged across different chains. It is also the largest decentralized application (dApp) in terms of total value locked at over $400 million dollars.</p>

<p>Singapore-based Cake Group, the parent company of crypto platform Bake, is winding up its company and has filed for liquidation.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/cake-group-founders-spat-worsens-cofounder-seeks-liquidation-firm">Tech in Asia report</a>, the founder of the crypto investment platform U-Zyn Chua has applied to wind up the Cake Group at a Singapore High Court.</p>
<p>The reasons for the company’s wind up aren’t clear. However, in September, Bake crypto platform, which changed its name from Cake DeFi, announced layoffs, affecting 30% of its workforce.</p>
<p>Bake said at the time that the cuts came as a “result of reorganization brought on by the current bear market and individual performance issues.”</p>
<p>Per the liquidation application, Chua listed himself as the plaintiff and the Cake Group as the defendant.</p>
<p>Winding up of a company in Singapore is a legal process where the court orders to sell company assets to pay debts. The remaining money from the assets collected after settling all debts, is then distributed among the company’s shareholders.</p>
<p>The liquidation claim is being filed under the Singaporean <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/40-2018/Published/20181107">Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act</a> of 2018, the court filing said.</p>
<p>The court has scheduled a hearing for creditors or opposers of the company winding up, for December 22.</p>
<h1>Cake Group’s Revenue Slump</h1>
<p>Cake Group saw massive growth in 2021 like many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/defi-guides/">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) platforms. The company released an unaudited financial statement at the time that showed revenue reaching $631 million, year-on-year increase of 1,800%.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Group’s operating income hit $203 million for the year. However, following the massive crash in crypto prices in May 2022, and the prolonged crypto winter, the growth gradually slumped.</p>
<p>Cake Group co-founder Julian Hosp said that the firm’s revenue fell to US$266 million in 2022, and profits dropped to US$23.5 million from US$134 million in 2021.</p>

<p>US Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has slammed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) criticizing the current crypto regulatory framework.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/gop-debate-alabama/">fourth Republican presidential debate</a> at the University of Tuscaloosa on Wednesday, Ramasamy expressed his advocacy for cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>He responded to a question from Eliana Johnson of Washington Free Beacon regarding the recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-czs-guilty-plea-accepted-by-us-judge.htm">guilty plea of Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao</a>, the former Binance CEO. CZ succumbed to legal pressures in a case involving anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.</p>
<p>“Fraudsters, criminals, and terrorists have been defrauding people for a long time,” Ramaswamy said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our regulations need to catch up with the current moment. The fact that SBF was able to do what he did FTX shows that whatever they have is the current framework isn&#8217;t working.”</p></blockquote>
<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler also got mentioned during the debate for his failure to classify <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> before Congress.</p>
<p>“I think it is nothing short of embarrassing that Gary Gensler, the current leader of the SEC, in front of Congress could not even say whether Ethereum counted as a regulated security or not,” Ramaswamy criticized. “I think that this is just another example of the administrative state gone too far.”</p>
<h1>DeSantis is anti-CBDC</h1>
<p>During the event, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis voiced his strong opposition to Central Bank Digital Currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDC</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">WATCH: Ron DeSantis warns about the danger of a Central Back Digital Currency (CBDC) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOPdebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GOPdebate</a> <a href="https://t.co/8W6WLLk6E1">pic.twitter.com/8W6WLLk6E1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Never Back Down (@NvrBackDown24) <a href="https://twitter.com/NvrBackDown24/status/1732586403530264655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>DeSantis framed Biden’s support for a CBDC as a direct threat to financial and personal freedom including privacy and unregulated purchasing power.</p>
<p>“They want to get rid of cash crypto, they want to force you to do that. They’ll take away your privacy, they will absolutely regulate your purchases,” DeSantis stressed.</p>
<blockquote><p>“On day one as President, we take the idea of central bank digital currency, and we throw it in the trash can. It’ll be dead on arrival.”</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis has criticized the current Biden administration’s hostile approach to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and other crypto assets. His campaigns in other cities have always included his strong opposition to CBDCs.</p>
<p>During a campaign event in New Hampshire in August, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/florida-governor-ron-desantis-vows-put-an-end-bidens-war-bitcoin-as-president.htm">DeSantis compared</a> the US CBDC plans to that of China. “As President, on day one, CBDC goes into the trash can,” he reiterated at the time.</p>
<h1>Crypto is a Part of Ramaswamy’s Campaign</h1>
<p>Ramaswamy recently <a href="https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1725260923865076060?s=20">released a plan</a> for cryptocurrency to curb the SEC’s control and the government’s involvement in the crypto space. He is committed to ousting most of the SEC officials to facilitate an environment for cryptos to thrive as commodities.</p>
<p>“The policy I released today will guarantee a vibrant future for crypto to ensure economic freedom for Americans seeking an alternative to centralized finance,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Monday, the crypto market turned favorable to such pro-crypto politicians. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-nears-41000-amid-broader-crypto-rally.htm">Bitcoin surpassed $41,000</a> for the first time in over a year and a half — marking a 150% rise so far this year.</p>

<p>French banking giant Societe Generale is listing its stablecoin, dubbed EUR CoinVertible, on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp crypto exchange.</p>
<p>EUR CoinVertible will be fully backed by Euros and issued on the Ethereum public blockchain, SocGen said in a <a href="https://www.sgforge.com/stablecoin-listing-bitstamp/">release</a>.</p>
<p>The stablecoin debut by a traditional financial giant marks a significant shift, offering access to digital tokens tracking the price of hard currencies.</p>
<p>The listing will be under Societe Generale Group’s subsidiary SG-FORGE, licensed as a digital asset service provider (DASP).</p>
<p>“With this listing, SG-FORGE offers the opportunity to the crypto ecosystem to diversify its positions and gain access to a robust, stable asset built on Societe Generale’s regulatory and structuring expertise,” says Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE.</p>
<p>The French lender’s token would challenge the existing stablecoin dominance, predominantly denominated in US dollars.</p>
<p>Stenger told Financial Times in an interview that 90% of stablecoins are pegged to USD and stressed that the bank finds a place in the field of Euro-denominated stablecoin.</p>
<p>He also hopes that SocGen’s stablecoin will settle trades in digital bonds, funds and other assets. While other financial giants like JPMorgan have their own stablecoin – JPM Coin – pegged to USD, Societe Generale’s EUR CoinVertible will be available widely for trading.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The best way to channel [investors’] interest is to grow in the usual route and venue which you use in the crypto industry, which is to have your product listed on a crypto exchange.”</p></blockquote>
<h1>Compliance with MiCA</h1>
<p>Stenger confirmed that SocGen’s stablecoin – EURCV – aligns with the EU’s flagship Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.</p>
<p>EU introduced MiCA in September 2020, to creating a comprehensive framework for cryptoasset service providers and token issuers. Stenger noted that only “very few stablecoins are compliant with MiCA”.</p>
<p>The stablecoin launch on Bitstamp comes days after SocGen issued its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/societe-generale-issues-first-digital-green-bond-as-security-token-on-ethereum-blockchain.htm">first digital green bond</a> on the Ethereum blockchain network. The bond values 10 million euros and carries a three-year maturity.</p>

<p>Phoenix Group Plc, an Abu Dhabi-based Bitcoin mining and colocation service provider, has reported a significant 50% surge in shares.</p>
<p>The company announced Sunday, its initial public offering (IPO) on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), slated for December 5th. The event marked the first public listing of a crypto mining and blockchain technology company in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The IPO raised 1.36 billion dirhams ($371 million), indicating a growing appetite for financial innovations in the region. Phoenix opted for ADX exchange, given its “dynamic and rapidly growing financial market that aligns with Phoenix’s vision,” the company said.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-firm-phoenix-jumps-50-after-371-million-abu-dhabi-ipo-1.2007282">Bloomberg report</a>, Phoenix had its initial listing on the exchange on Tuesday with shares priced at 2.25 dirhams. The trading on the first day exceeded expectations, soaring 50% from the IPO price of 1.50 dirhams.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139665" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139665" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139665" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701848950-phoenix-trading-view.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="526" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701848950-phoenix-trading-view.jpeg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701848950-phoenix-trading-view-300x175.jpeg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701848950-phoenix-trading-view-768x449.jpeg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701848950-phoenix-trading-view-150x88.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139665" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Trading View</figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, the IPO offer was 33 times oversubscribed, said the report, adding that for the retail portion of the offering, the oversubscription rate was 180 times.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re embarking on a journey that promises to enhance our technological footprint, driven by our commitment to digital finance and tech innovation,” said Munaf Ali, co-founder of Phoenix Group.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is a pivotal moment for us to propel Phoenix Group into a new era of growth and global impact.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Abu Dhabi’s latest IPO record proves that investor appetite is unwavering. The underlying appetite for Middle East listings comes at a time when regional geopolitical tensions are high and as investors fear high interest rates and volatility. Also, it stands in contrast to the subdued appetite for IPOs in regions like London and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Japanese lawmakers discussed Tuesday on plans to exempt companies from paying tax on unrealized <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> gains. The proposal is set to be included in the fiscal 2024 tax reform plan.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Japan-weighs-ending-tax-on-some-corporate-crypto-holdings#:~:text=Under%20the%20proposed%20tax%20code,end%20of%20each%20fiscal%20year.">Nikkei report</a>, the proposal is being discussed by the country&#8217;s ruling coalition. The proposal applies to Japanese firms that hold on to digital assets for purposes other than short-term trading.</p>
<p>The exemption from corporate tax will be based on mark-to-market valuations at the end of fiscal year, the report added.</p>
<p>Mark-to-market refer to measuring the fair values of accounts that are subject to periodic fluctuations such as cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Some of these companies include VC firms, non-fungible tokens businesses and other blockchain firms that hold cryptos for payment purposes. Additionally, crypto issuers, who are also holders of cryptos are not subject to taxes.</p>
<p>Policymakers from the Liberal Democratic Party and ruling coalition partner Komeito discussed the tax exemptions on Tuesday.</p>
<h1>Crypto Tax Clarity in Japan</h1>
<p>In June, the country’s National Tax Agency <a href="https://www.nta.go.jp/law/tsutatsu/kihon/hojin/kaisei/2306xx/pdf/A.pdf">published a notice</a>, clearing that crypto issuers in the country will not have to pay capital gains taxes on unrealized gains.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/japan/">Japan</a> has been reviewing its crypto tax treatment since at least last year, to encourage companies to remain in the country. Particularly after many startups left the country due to heavy tax burdens.</p>
<p>Recently, Japan’s top financial regulator Financial Services Agency (FSA) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japan-edging-toward-crypto-tax-reform.htm">submitted legislation-change requests</a> to the government to change the way Japan taxes domestic crypto firms.</p>
<p>“The rule has long been criticized for placing a burden on companies and hindering innovation in the cryptoasset and blockchain sectors,” a local media noted.</p>
<p>On October 16, some of the biggest businesses in Japan <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-japanese-businesses-ask-govt-reform-crypto-tax-system-1.htm">sought government action</a> to make crypto tax reforms. The Japan Association of New Economy (JANE) has asked the government to “reduce tax rates” in 2024 to “encourage growth and increase tax revenue.”</p>

<p>Valour, a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies, has revealed plans to introduce 20 new crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs).</p>
<p>Announced Monday, the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/defi-technologies-subsidiary-valour-inc-provides-updates-on-aum-and-market-share-for-the-month-ending-november-2023-302004303.html">planned offerings</a> include collaborations with foundations like the recent ICP ETP, thematic baskets, short and long-leverage products.</p>
<p>The ETPs will be based on active crypto investment strategies and are subject to exchange approval, the release noted.</p>
<p>Last month, the firm <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/defi-technologies-inc-announces-upcoming-launch-of-valour-incs-ripple-xrp-etp-and-other-corporate-updates-301995705.html">announced plans</a> to launch a Ripple (XRP) ETP on a European exchange in December. Valour’s existing product range includes a slew of crypto ETPs with low management fees. Some of the tokens that Valour supports include Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX) and Binance (BNB).</p>
<p>The addition of 20 new crypto ETP comes along with Valour’s successful progress in both market shares and assets under management last month.</p>
<p>Valour’s market share on Swedish exchange has soared from 28% in October to an impressive 42.71% as of November. The growth represents a 52.54% increase in market share moth over month.</p>
<p>“This success reflects our commitment to developing offerings that align with investor interests in the Nordics, and we are proud to contribute to a more accessible and dynamic financial ecosystem,” said Johanna Belitz, Head of Nordics, Valour.</p>
<p>In August, Valour launched an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Physical Staking ETP (1VET), listed on the Deutsche Boerse with a total expense ratio of 1.49%. It is the firm’s second Ethereum ETP after it launched the Valour Ethereum Zero in December 2021.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the company launched <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> Carbon Neutral ETP (1VBT) in June.</p>
<h1>Global Crypto ETP Growth</h1>
<p>A recent report by the digital asset platform Fineqia noted that crypto-based ETPs recorded a 91% increase from Jan 2023. It outpaced the already fast-growing crypto market rally by 30% during the same period.</p>
<p>As of June, 166 crypto ETPs and ETFs were <a href="https://etfgi.com/news/press-releases/2023/07/etfgi-reports-crypto-etfs-and-etps-gathered-net-inflows-425-million-us">listed globally</a> by 35 providers, on 20 exchanges, in 16 countries. Companies such as Blackrock, Fidelity, Invesco, and WisdomTree have also increased the hype around crypto ETPs to attract investors.</p>

<p>Itaú Unibanco, Brazil&#8217;s largest private bank, has entered the crypto space with new trading service, per a Reuters report.</p>
<p>The lender would first launch <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ether</a> (ETH) trading for clients of its investment platform. The bank’s crypto division head Guto Antunes said in an interview that it is planning to add other cryptocurrency options soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It starts with bitcoin, but our overarching strategic plan is to expand to other crypto assets in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The support of other tokens trading would depend on the progression of crypto regulations within the country, Antunes noted.</p>
<p>The latest move by Brazil’s largest lender aligns with the increasing demand for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> services. The move also aligns with the global trend of traditional financial institutions incorporating crypto services.</p>
<p>Itau promises to stand out from its competitors like crypto exchange MB and investment bank BTG Pactual’s crypto unit, Mynt. Aside from local firms, the bank also faces competition from international platforms including Binance.</p>
<p>The announcement comes a month after two local entities, XP brokerage and financial services firm PicPay bowed out of the crypto market. PicPay attributed its departure to the crypto’s existing regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<h1>Demand for Crypto Services in Brazil</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/latin-america-cryptocurrency-adoption/">recent Chainalysis data</a> paints an optimistic picture for the Brazilian crypto market. Some crypto traders along with basic retail users were stuck to the asset class even during crypto winter.</p>
<p>Further, Brazilians display a higher demand for Bitcoin and altcoins, which are more typically used for long-term investment and speculation.</p>
<p>While the crypto regulatory environment evolves, Brazil is also experiencing substantial demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>This strong demand for crypto-related financial instruments suggests a rising interest in digital assets among Brazilian investors.</p>

<p>Standard Chartered Bank-backed digital assets custodian Zodia Custody, has integrated Metaco network’s global crypto storage services.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership is aimed at offering global sub-custody services for cryptocurrencies. This means that Metaco would store client’s funds and provide means to manage them including initiating transfers via web interface.</p>
<p>Zodia’s partnership aims to expand its services and reach a wider audience by providing safekeeping and settlement of digital assets. Zodia Custody CEO Julian Sawyer said Monday that the service gradually evolves to resemble how assets are stored in traditional finance.</p>
<p>“I think of this as the third generation of crypto custody, where multiple custodians are linked together,” he told CoinDesk. Sawyer further stressed that different types of networks are important in terms of linking custodians together in a compliant manner.</p>
<p>The integration comes a month after Zodia Custody <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-crypto-firm-zodia-launches-in-hong-kong.htm">expanded its services in Hong Kong</a> in response to institutional demand. In recent months, the company has already extended its services to Japan, Singapore, and Australia, proving its presence in the institutional crypto custody space.</p>
<h1>Digital Asset Custody Evolution</h1>
<p>Particularly after the FTX collapse last year, the crypto industry has been battling with a major lack of trust and transparency.</p>
<p>Zhu Kuang Lee, chief digital, data and innovation officer at HSBC said last month that there has been an “increasing demand for custody and fund administration of digital assets from asset managers and asset owners, as this market continues to evolve.”</p>
<p>HSBC announced in November, its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hsbc-announces-plans-to-launch-digital-asset-custody-service-in-partnership-with-metaco.htm">plans to launch a custody service</a> for storing blockchain-based assets excluding cryptocurrency in 2024. The financial services giant has also planned its partnership with Metaco to carry out the services.</p>
<p>Swiss-based firm Metaco leverages <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">Ripple</a>’s (XRP) scale and market strength to reach to clients at a faster pace. Ripple acquired Metaco early this year in a first major acquisition for $250 million.</p>

<p>Nexo, a lending platform that provides instant crypto loans, has partnered with Koinly to simplify user’s tax reporting.</p>
<p><a href="https://koinly.io/integrations/nexo/">Effective November 30</a>, 2023, the collaboration enables Nexo users to easily generate tailored crypto tax reports. A company statement said that the partnership will streamline the crypto tax reporting and preparation of financial statements.</p>
<p>Further, Koinly allows Nexo users to cater to their specific transaction histories and tax obligations through the Nexo app. Nexo clients can also access custom country-wise tax reports for over 100 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Koinly reflects our dedication to providing holistic financial solutions and empowering our clients to make informed financial decisions,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and Managing Partner of Nexo.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company noted that the service automates accurate tax reports, simplifying tax complications and reducing human error. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/nexo/">Nexo</a> users can avail the service for free up to 800 transactions annually. For users exceeding this transaction volume, a 30% discount is offered on Koinly.</p>
<p>The news comes months after Nexo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nexo-launches-a-crypto-powered-debit-and-credit-mastercard-for-the-european-economic-area-eea.htm">launched</a> a crypto-powered debit and credit MasterCard for users in the European Economic Area. Dubbed the <a href="https://nexo.com/nexo-card">Nexo “Dual Mode Crypto”</a> Card offers a variety of features including the ability to optimize tax responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Simplification of Crypto Taxation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With the growth of Web3 activity, accounting for crypto gains and losses is becoming a common pain point for users and businesses alike. According to a July <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/07/05/crypto-poses-significant-tax-problems-and-they-could-get-worse">IMF report</a>, the most fundamental difficulty in taxing crypto assets is that they are “pseudonymous.”</p>
<p>For instance, Web3 firms need to track transactions across multiple blockchains and wallets to properly report crypto gains and losses on their business tax returns. This requires deep blockchain data integrations.</p>
<p>Adam Saville Brown, Head of Partnerships at Koinly, highlighted that the collaboration is a milestone for simplification of crypto taxes.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The collaboration aligns with Koinly’s mission to service the tax needs of crypto investors and with Nexo’s innovative approach in the crypto financial services sector.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nexo is also planning to launch educational materials on cryptocurrency tax reporting, the statement added.</p>

<p>American banking giant JPMorgan has shed light of optimism in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) sectors.</p>
<p>A JPMorgan report published Thursday revealed notable revival in the DeFi and NFT activity, spurred by an improved crypto markets sentiment. Titled ‘Resurgence in DeFi and NFTs: A Market Shift,’ the study attributes the resurgence to the recent US <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ETF expectations.</p>
<p>The report stressed DeFi and NFT market recovery, though positive in recent times, are only “tentative signs of revival.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“While there is no doubt that the recent resurgence in DeFi/NFT activity is a positive sign, it is too early to get excited about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A team of analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted that the increase comes nearly after two years of market decline. “Thus, creating some optimism that the worst might be behind us in terms of the medium-term trajectory for DeFi/NFT activity.”</p>
<h2>Increased Trading Activity in Decentralized Exchanges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The analysts further wrote that some DeFi recovery is “natural,” given the rise in trading activity in decentralized exchanges (DEX).</p>
<p>DEXs are rapidly gaining popularity in the crypto world for their emphasis on user control, privacy and security. According to <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs">DefiLlama</a>, trading volume on DEXs rose to $133.1 billion in March 2023, the third straight monthly increase.</p>
<p>Further, liquid staking by Lido has also contributed to the improvement in DeFi since early 2023, the JPMorgan report noted. Lido (LDO) liquid staking solution for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> allows users to earn staking rewards without locking assets.</p>
<p>The analysts also pointed out Ether (ETH), which has underperformed other cryptos, impacting the total value locked (TVL) measurement. This “would mechanically show some revival given the price of several smaller cryptocurrencies has risen by more than ether in recent months,” they added.</p>
<p>However, the emergence of new blockchains, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms is seen as encouraging, the bank said. Ethereum blockchain still faces issues like “network scalability, low transaction speeds and higher fees,” despite the rise in DeFi.</p>

<p>Decentralized network <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/algo-algorand/">Algorand</a> (ALGO) has partnered with key players in India to deepen India’s Web3 foundation.</p>
<p>In a significant move explained by the blockchain platform’s CEO Staci Warden, Algorand will partner with the Indian tech advocacy group – NASSCOM.</p>
<p>Other partners include TiE Bangalore, a global entrepreneurship supporting program, and India’s first women-centric bank – the Mann Deshi Foundation.</p>
<p>Warden told CoinDesk in an interview that the collaboration will foster Web3 capabilities under NASSCOM’s FutureSkills Prime skilling hub. The hub is a digital skilling initiative, developed in partnership with the IT industry, academia and government.</p>
<p>Further, Algorand will also develop a blockchain-based credit scorecard and identity system for women entrepreneurs of the Mann Deshi Foundation. The collaboration with TiE Bangalore will enable Algorand to provide educational initiatives to support the Indian Web3 ecosystem, Warden added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In just a year, our strategic collaborations and innovative blockchain solutions with key players (in India) have pioneered financial inclusion, with the potential for impacting millions of lives in underserved communities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Algorand India’s country head Anil Kakani noted that the firm is aiming to have organizational partnerships to deepen the Web3. It is also working on partnerships to build Web3 use cases in India.</p>
<p>Kakani stressed that Algorand won’t go to regulators with recommendations, however, it is anticipating India’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) launch.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We want to see how we can build on that but as a protocol, our heavy focus is real-world utility.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>AlgoBharat</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Algorand Foundation entered India with its new project “AlgoBharat” in March, aiming to support India’s foray into the Web3 space.</p>
<p>At the time, Algorand partnered with the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) to support women-led enterprises in building blockchain solutions. It also joined hands with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and the Indian School of Business to launch faculty development programs.</p>
<p>Kakani said at the time that the company has been understanding the appetite for Web3 in India. “We will certainly engage with regulators this year,” he mentioned.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a> is reportedly facing challenges in Thailand ahead of its plans to launch a new crypto platform with billionaire Sarath Ratanavadi’s Gulf Energy.</p>
<p>The beleaguered exchange, which is currently facing criminal charges and civil lawsuits in the US, is under scrutiny in Thailand.</p>
<p>The regulatory challenges have risen in the jurisdiction due to Binance’s recent incidents including a $4.3 billion settlement with the US authorities and CEO Changpeng Zhao’s guilty plea and stepping down from the board.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/crypto-exchange-binance-s-reboot-faces-test-in-thailand">Bloomberg</a>, Sarath Ratanavadi said that Binance wasn’t accused of fraud or misappropriating customer assets in the US settlement. Gulf Energy holds a 51% stake in the planned crypto exchange, while Binance holds the minority stake.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Binance grew extremely fast and so probably crossed paths with some regulations. We have much more confidence in its credibility after this storm, which should make it a lot stronger.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The domestic Binance-Gulf Energy joint venture would likely delay its launch, following the scrutiny. The global exchange is now headed by CEO Richard Teng, former chief executive of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.</p>
<p>Ratanavadi noted that Thailand’s regulator Securities &amp; Exchange Commission is “very strict” and asked a lot of questions about Binance, before approval. He added that his firm chose Binance due to its market-leading position.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Binance is also undergoing an accusation from the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission for operating without a license. The regulator noted that the world’s largest crypto exchange lacks authorization to sell securities in the country.</p>
<p>The regulator <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-in-philippines-binance-is-operating-without-a-license-heres-the-latest.htm">issued a warning</a> to Filipinos on Wednesday to exercise utmost caution while dealing with such unregistered exchanges.</p>

<p>The co-founder of the crypto-focused VC firm Electric Capital, Avichal Garg, has warned investors over a potential disguised crypto scam.</p>
<p>The early-stage VC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1968099/000196809923000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">that raised</a> $300 million for its third fund in September, is now being targeted by crypto scammers.</p>
<p>According to Garg’s warning, the perpetrators are masquerading as representatives of Electric Capital, setting up meetings. They then lure individuals to send money before investing, he added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately, scammers are pretending to be <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectricCapital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ElectricCapital</a>, setting up meetings, and asking people to send them money before investing.</p>
<p>Electric Capital will *never* ask you to send money before receiving an investment. </p>
<p>We will never reach out cold via Telegram. We almost…</p>
<p>&mdash; Avichal &#8211; Electric ϟ Capital (@avichal) <a href="https://twitter.com/avichal/status/1729263598776836601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p>“Ultimately this is a social engineering attack, so there will always be an angle the scammers will try to take. It will likely get worse in the height of the next bull market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Among crypto scams, social engineering attack is used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, crypto wallets and accounts. Such attacks include phishing mail, baiting, pretexting, among others.</p>
<p>Further, Garg stressed that the company would never ask users to send money in advance, before receiving an investment.</p>
<p>He clarified that the Palo Alto-headquartered firm has only limited official communication channels. “We only send emails from the electriccapital.com” domain, he said.</p>
<p>To prevent such impersonation, Electric Capital is working on additional verifications on social media channels, Garg further reassured investors.</p>
<h2>Fund Falsely Represented as “Electric”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A recent <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/threat-intelligence-reports">cyber threat intelligence report</a> by financial advisory firm Kroll revealed that there has been an increase in social engineering scam tactics in 2023 compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Garg explained to users in another post that these scammers do actual diligence, disguising to be from Electric Capital. They then lure prospective victims to become limited partners (LP) in bogus “Electric” fund and ask them to send money.</p>
<p>“Once diligence is done and founder is an LP in Electric, they will get investment,” he added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since people are asking how the scam works:<br />&#8211; scammers pretend to be EC &amp; do actual diligence (!)<br />&#8211; scammers tell the founder to become an LP into an &quot;Electric&quot; fund and to send money<br />&#8211; claim that once diligence is done and founder is an LP in Electric, they will get investment</p>
<p>&mdash; Avichal &#8211; Electric ϟ Capital (@avichal) <a href="https://twitter.com/avichal/status/1729266632437256321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Garg’s warning comes shortly following a <a href="https://twitter.com/defendersdao/status/1729321256556847308">SIM swap attack</a> on the smart contract security marketplace Code4arena&#8217;s X account, on Monday. Hackers posted a scam airdrop on its X account, which reportedly announced ARENA tokens airdrop endorsed by VC firm Paradigm.</p>

<p>Former Governor of China’s central bank PBOC is all optimistic about the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) nearing completion.</p>
<p>Speaking at a conference in Honng Kong on Monday, Zhou Xiaochuan, the 75-year Chinese economist, said that a ‘digital yuan’ is “already on track” and the “final stage is not very far away.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ninety percent of retail payments in China are already digitalized. There is only 10 percent left to do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The significant stride from the ex-governor, comes days after the central bank released a <a href="http://zj.people.com.cn/n2/2023/1125/c186327-40654676.html">white paper</a> on cross-border e-CNY solution.</p>
<p>Zhou delivered the key-note address at the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, stressing the importance of digital currencies. He said that after China debuted on its CBDC in 2019, the project has seen high transactions and total value.</p>
<p>He highlighted challenges including mobility and convertibility of digital currencies, data protection and privacy issues, that the bank would deep-dive.</p>
<p>Zhao has been the longest-serving Governor of PBOC, with 16 years of tenure. His remarks on digital currencies and CBDC reflects China’s commitment towards digital payments innovation. Particularly at a time when other jurisdictions face increasing interest rates and rising inflation.</p>
<p>The conference was organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Over 20 incumbent central bank governors, deputy governors and former governors attended the meeting. The current Governor of PBOC, Pan Gongsheng, also delivered a keynote speech on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Governors from financial institutions across the globe, including Australia, Spain, England and Thailand attended the event. Some of the topics discussed at the conference include financial stability, inflation and labor markets.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Chinese arm of the Standard Chartered Bank <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-to-participate-in-trials-of-chinas-digital-yuan-cbdc-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">joined China’s digital yuan trials</a>. The bank said that it is collaborating with City Bank Clearing Services to provide access to the CBDC’s interconnection platform.</p>

<p>Crypto platform OKX announced its official launch in Brazil, offering users with advanced crypto features including trading and staking rewards.</p>
<p>The roll-out would feature a Web3 wallet in Brazil, providing a secured and trusted gateway to DeFi and crypto trading.</p>
<p>The company said in a  Monday <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/okx-officially-launches-crypto-exchange-and-web3-wallet-in-brazil-301997640.html">official release</a>, that it would provide trading with Brazilian real fiat-on ramp capabilities.</p>
<p>“We know that Brazilians expect fast and liquid trading, along with a secure self-custody wallet solution, all in one app,” said OKX Brazil General Manager Guilherme Sacamone.</p>
<p>The news comes days after the crypto exchange applied for a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) license in Hong Kong. OKX became the first major industry player to apply in Hong Kong under the new crypto regime.</p>
<h2>Wallet Features</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
OKX President Hong Fang said that the OKX wallet comes with a slew of features including easy access to DeFi, NFTs, dApps and more.</p>
<p>Further, the wallet features both Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology and Account Abstraction (AA) features, which helps in wider adoption among non-technical users.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We look forward to driving innovation and growth of the Web3 and crypto economy with millions of users as the market matures in Brazil.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent study conducted by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/okex/">OKX exchange</a> revealed that Brazilians found security as the major concern. Among the responders, 92% urged for a clear and transparent security regulations for their investments. Over 85% voted for proof of reserves (PoR) as a legitimate way of verifying customer assets held by a crypto exchange.</p>
<p>“Given the results of our recent survey, we also recognize that security and transparency are top priorities for crypto users in the country,” says Sacamone.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Therefore, OKX provides its trading solutions with the best security features, such as our robust Proof of Reserves program.”</p></blockquote>

<p>North Korea’s state-backed hacking group ‘Kimsuky,’ is supposedly behind a cryptocurrency heist, where hackers disguised as South Korean government agencies.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2023-11-22/national/northKorea/Norths-hackers-pose-as-officials-journalists-to-steal-info-and-crypto/1919045">local report</a>, hackers impersonated as South Korean journalists, government agencies and research institutes. Between March and October 2023, a total of 1,468 people fell victim to the crypto hackers, the local police confirmed.</p>
<p>The victims included 57 incumbent or retired government officials in diplomacy, military and national security. The rest 1,411 victims were working in the private sector, the report added.</p>
<p>“The police will work closely with relevant institutions and agencies to continuously track down North Korea’s cyber-attacks and breaches to prevent losses,” a police officer noted.</p>
<h2>Phishing Mails Sent</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The South Korean National Police Agency said that the perpetrators sent phishing mails to execute the dubious act. These mails pretended to be sent from South Korean government agencies including the National Police Agency, National Health Insurance Service, National Pension Service and National Tax Service.</p>
<p>Further, it contained ‘clickbait’ – a link encouraging visitors to click to a particular web page – with words like notice, questionnaire. Once victims open the scam mail or attached files, the hackers infest computers with a malware, police explained.</p>
<p>The malware then stole victims’ personal information and cryptocurrency. “Illegal cyber activity was aimed at stealing cryptocurrency,” they added.</p>
<p>According to the police data, attackers stole ID’s and profile information of 19 victims to access their crypto trading accounts. Additionally, they seized 147 proxy servers to carry out crypto mining programs.</p>
<p>The police have closed 42 phishing websites operated by the North Korean hacker group to prevent further loss.</p>
<p>The North Korean Kimsuky hacker group operates under the country’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea’s foreign intelligence agency. South Korea government sanctioned Kimsuky in June.</p>

<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is reportedly ramping up its surveillance towards the crypto market introducing fresh warnings.</p>
<p>The regulator on Friday issued warning on cryptocurrency investments criticizing the digital tokens as “created out of nothing.” ASIC chair Joseph Longo also slammed the beleaguered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a> exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao over its unclear structure.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s basically created out of nothing, out of the ether – it’s basically computer code.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/companies/asics-new-cryptocurrency-warnings-australia-ahead-of-new-federal-government-laws-coming/news-story/41845cb7da51de2136a8d869c9a8572d?amp&amp;nk=092d4788ba5e7a85f321b9284c053a5a-1700796636">report</a> by an Australian daily, ASIC issued strict crypto warnings and would tighten its cryptocurrency laws by 2025. A new legislation, paying attention to the risks of cryptos will be introduces soon, it said.</p>
<p>“The whole crypto story to my mind remains one that we should be very, very, very cautious about,” Longo said.</p>
<p>He also stressed that many digital tokens are not traded in a way which isn’t transparent and the processes are opaque.</p>
<p>Further, Longo also raised concerns on those investors who can’t afford to lose their money on cryptos. “But I do worry about people who think that it’s an activity that you could equate with superannuation or having a mortgage or buying some property.”</p>
<p>Longo added that cryptos remained on AISC’s radar with four legal cases currently underway.</p>
<p>“My key message remains: be careful before you put your money into crypto,” he warned. “The other reason I worry about crypto is that you can trade crypto anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>The warning and the new legislation on cryptos come at a time when 906,000 Aussies said that they are likely to enter the crypto market for the first time in next 12months, according to Australian Digital Assets Survey, 2023.</p>
<p>Longo further said that once the legislation passes the parliament, ASIC will get extra funding to tackle crypto.</p>
<h2>Binance is “Opaque”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Furthermore, Longo mentioned the opaque and unclear structure of Binance as the exchange faces trouble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the recent stepping down of its CEO CZ.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I mean, look at Binance – where are they based? We still don’t know. So, what am I dealing with?”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court, crypto regulations in Australia has two factors – design and ways to enforce it.</p>
<p>“Crypto has been a really critical part of the enforcement that we’ve been doing this year,” she noted. “If we see misconduct though that raises significant issues in the same way as these other cases then absolutely we will continue to prioritize and take enforcement action.”</p>

<p>Crypto and asset tokenization platform TokenFi announced a new Token Launcher that simplifies token creation on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Goerli chain.</p>
<p>The innovative token creation service will allow users to generate tokens “without touching a line of code.” This means that users can customize token parameters without any coding skills. This is essential in the industry where token creation demands technical expertise and lack of which often limit participation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TOKENFI TOKEN LAUNCHER AND TOKENFI QUICKLAUNCH BOT ARE LIVE ON TESTNET</p>
<p>You can now officially create tokens in just a few clicks and without touching a line of code with TokenFi Token Launcher and TokenFi QuickLaunch Bot on the Ethereum Goerli chain! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokenFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TokenFi</a> Token Launcher… <a href="https://t.co/BsiRijIcIJ">pic.twitter.com/BsiRijIcIJ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; TokenFi (@tokenfi) <a href="https://twitter.com/tokenfi/status/1727760842169495857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“Token Launcher can be used via any desktop or mobile-based web browser,” the announcement read.</p>
<p>With the launch of the new Token Launcher service, the subsidiary of Floki Inu aims to create digital asset tokenization more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Further, the news comes at a time when TokenFi is facing challenges from Bitget Exchange. Bitget delisted TokenFi’s digital asset TOKEN, accusing the company of potential market manipulation and opaque vesting schedule.</p>
<p>Bitget said early this month that TokenFi “maliciously controlled the initial liquidity” of the token, following significant price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The offshoot of Floki Inu, TokenFi, also shared an official video tutorial on how to create crypto tokens on the Ethereum Goerli testnet.</p>

<h2>Introducing TokenFi QuickLaunch Bot</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Additionally, TokenFi also launched TokenFi QuickLaunch Bot, which is integrated into popular communication platforms including Telegram and Discord. It offers an innovative and streamlined approach to token creation.</p>
<p>Integrating with social media platforms, QuickLaunch Bot taps into its existing user bases, bringing in a new audience to the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The TOKEN price has seen a noticeable fluctuation following the announcement. The crypto prices showed a slight surge, proving its optimistic response. TOKEN is trading at $0.0273 at press time.</p>
