<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSD">Terra Luna Classic price</a> has surged by 30% in the past 24 hours, with its race to $0.00023831 also marking a 104% gain in a week.</p>
<p>This means LUNC is the best-performing top-100 coin within these timeframes, with the altcoin gaining momentum in recent weeks as a result of increasing agreement within the Terra Luna Classic community.</p>
<p>And with this community recently providing more than 90% approval for a new upgrade, LUNC could continue rising in the next few days, particularly if the wider market continues its bullish uptrend.</p>
<h2>Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as LUNC Becomes Best Performer of the Week – $1 LUNC Incoming?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There&#8217;s little doubt that LUNC is very hot coin at the moment, with its indicators all moving into very bullish positions.</p>
<p>Indeed, its RSI (purple) is now touching 90, and while this ordinarily indicates that it has entered &#8216;overbought territory&#8217;, LUNC&#8217;s status as an oversold coin for so long should enable it to sustain gains over the coming weeks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138899" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138899" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png" alt="Terra Luna Classic price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701690421-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138899" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Encouragingly, the coin&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has only recently climbed over its 200-day (blue), implying that it still has quite a bit of time before it&#8217;s likely to correct downwards again.</p>
<p>Possibly the most bullish aspect of LUNC&#8217;s chart is its 24-hour trading volume, which after being negligible throughout previous months has not jumped to $1.25 billion.</p>
<p>This all-but guarantees that whales have resumed buying and accumulating the token, with many community members becoming increasingly confident that LUNC will reach new highs over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>&mdash; LUNC WHALE<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f433.png" alt="🐳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f48e.png" alt="💎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@MrOlusile) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrOlusile/status/1731287335034073590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There are various reasons for LUNC&#8217;s improving fortunes, with the general market-wide rally being the most obvious.</p>
<p>Yet LUNC has also benefitted from the passage of a number of significant governance proposals, including a proposal – which has now been implemented – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-gains-56-is-the-rally-to-1-starting.htm">to halt the minting of USTC</a>, LUNC&#8217;s sister stablecoin.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also important that the increasing acceptance of governance proposals points to growing harmony and agreement with the Terra Luna Classic community, something which points towards greater progress over time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e0.png" alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> LunaClassicLabs.com (@LunaClassicLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/LunaClassicLabs/status/1728763793503863012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Indeed, one recent proposal – <a href="https://station.terraclassic.community/proposal/columbus-5/11885">to introduce an update that fixes a mismatch issue</a> – received 92% approval, making it one of the most widely accepted LUNC proposals in recent weeks.</p>
<p>As such, this highlights a growing shared sense of purpose among community members, and the possibility that LUNC may enjoy more growth in 2024.</p>
<p>The Terra Luna Classic price could therefore reach $0.001 within the first few months of the new year.</p>
<h2>New Alts With Strong Fundamentals and High Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">Because LUNC&#8217;s indicators suggest that its rally may be close to peaking in the short term, some traders may prefer to look elsewhere right now.</span></p>
<p>Luckily, there&#8217;s no shortage of new and promising alts in the market, with several presale tokens currently generating significant amounts of momentum.</p>
<p>Possibly the most promising of all is<span style="font-size: 16px"> </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, a stake-to-mine platform that has raised more than $4.7 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p>Set to go live in the next few weeks, Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s platform provides users with the chance to stake its native token BTCMTX in order to mine actual Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Staking BTCMTX means that users receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can then spend to have mining pools mine for them.</p>
<p>By doing this enough, users will receive mined BTC, with Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s system set to widen access to mining at a time when Bitcoin rewards are set to become scarcer.</p>
<p>On top of this, staking also provides users with a steady stream of new BTCMTX tokens, with the altcoin having a max supply of four billion.</p>

<p>Such year-to-date growth is relatively disappointing in relation to other major tokens, yet it&#8217;s arguable that SHIB&#8217;s prior underperformance now puts it in a position to grow vigorously over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>And with most analysts expecting a bull market in 2024, SHIB could enjoy several months of sustained rises soon enough.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Meme Coins See Double-Digit Gains – Time to Buy?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SHIB&#8217;s chart suggests that the meme token is definitely on the up right now, with its indicators all signalling increased buying pressure.</p>
<p>Its relative strength index (purple) has surged from 50 a week ago to nearly 70, with more rising possible before the coin enters overbought territory.</p>

<p>Even more bullishly, the meme token&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has begun rising more aggressively beyond the 200-day average (blue), having over taken the longer term average just under two weeks ago.</p>
<p>This suggests that SHIB may have entered a period of sustained gains, with more price increases likely to follow in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, its 24-hour trading volume has now risen to around $600 million, from $100 million only a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>This suggests a big leap in interest in the token, with recent data showing that whales have begun accumulating it once again.</p>

<p>As such, the Shiba Inu price is likely to witness further gains in the very near future, with the coin set to increasingly compensate for underperformance in previous months.</p>
<p>And underperform it really has, given that Shiba Inu has rolled out a number of significant updates and features this year.</p>
<p>This includes layer-two network Shibarium, which is currently racking up more and more transactions with every passing week, providing Shiba Inu users with faster and cheaper transactions.</p>

<p>It also includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-shibariums-shib-name-service-launch-nears-is-a-price-surge-expected.htm">the Shiba Inu name service</a>, which enables users to convert long alphanumeric wallet address into more digestible and sharable names.</p>
<p>And with SHIB: The Metaverse likely launching next year, SHIB&#8217;s fundamentals could really help it make the most of the expected 2024 bull market.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Shiba Inu price could reach $0.000020 within the first few months of the year.</p>
<h2><strong>Alternative High-Potential Meme Tokens</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While 2024 looks set to be a year in which SHIB will make amends for past poor performance, it won&#8217;t be the only meme coin rallying hard over the next few months.</p>
<p>There are in fact various newer meme tokens in the market that have not only been attracting plenty of attention, but which also boast good fundamentals.</p>
<p>This includes <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised in excess of $2.4 million in its popular presale.</span></p>

<p>What provides Meme Kombat with interesting fundamentals is that it&#8217;s not only a meme coin, but actually a platform that enables users to bet on AI-generated meme battles.</p>
<p>Yes, its platform will use AI to auto-generate battles between meme characters, which will be rendered and visualized in real-time for users to watch.</p>
<p>Users can bet against each other on the outcomes of such battles, while they can also bet against the platform itself.</p>
<p>Either way, they place bets using MK, which Meme Kombat will also use to pay out winnings.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">Not only that, but MK holders will be able to use the token for staking, earning themselves a steady passive income in the process.</span></p>

<p>These features have all helped to attract investors to Meme Kombat&#8217;s presale, and with the cryptocurrency launching at a time when interest in meme coins remains very strong, it could have a big 2024.</p>
<p>People can join its sale by heading over to the<span style="font-size: medium"> </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat official website</a>, where 1 MK token now costs $0.0225.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD">XRP price</a> has risen by 3% in the past 24 hours, moving to $0.639999 on a day when increasing bullishness has pushed the entire crypto market by 4%.</p>
<p>XRP has now gained by 6% in a week and by 4% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin – the fifth-biggest token in the market (by cap) – also having risen by 88% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that today&#8217;s market-wide jump is the start of an end-of-year rally, with the Bitcoin ETF approvals and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-soars-3-5-fed-cuts-stir-usd-zodia-joins-ripples-network.htm">likely rate cuts</a> potentially bringing a full-on bull market next year.</p>
<p>If so, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp.htm">XRP</a> is likely to benefit massively, helped along by Ripple&#8217;s recent victories against the SEC and the company&#8217;s renewed growth.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Prediction as $1.2 Billion Trading Volume Floods In – Bull Market Starting?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Perhaps unsurprisingly, XRP&#8217;s indicators are beginning to show a renewed upwards tendency, pointing to further gains.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) has now steepened its ascent and looks set to retake 60, with its current trajectory suggesting that the coin will post additional gains on its way to 70 or higher.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138833" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138833" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138833" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart.png" alt="XRP price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701684044-xrp-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138833" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>And while XRP&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) had flattened out a little over the past week, it now looks like it will resume rising even higher above the 200-day average, again signalling likely gains.</p>
<p>Other bullish signs include the fact that XRP&#8217;s support level (green) continues to rise steadily, while the altcoin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume has now risen beyond $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>This is up massively from levels witnessed in September and early October, but still actually some way below the $3 billion+ levels recorded at the beginning of November.</p>
<p>In other words, XRP&#8217;s current rally may be only just beginning, with plenty more room for intensification.</p>
<p>Yet the coin may dip a little in the next day or so on the way to medium-term gains, since some whales seem to be preparing to sell.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Regardless, the overall picture for both XRP and the wider market remains very positive, with many analysts expecting a bull market in 2024.</p>
<p>Such a bull market will follow from the SEC potentially approving Bitcoin ETFs, while the Federal Reserve could add fuel to the fire by cutting rates.</p>
<p>As for XRP, it has enjoyed seeing Ripple secure a series of very positive rulings in its long-running case with the SEC, with some legal experts predicting a settlement and complete end to the case by the summer.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Taken together, such factors all point to a rising XRP price, which could reach $1 in the first few weeks of 2024.</p>
<h2>New High-Potential Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
But XRP isn&#8217;t the only altcoin likely to rally hard in the next few weeks, with a number of newer alts also moving into positions where big returns look increasingly likely.</p>
<p>This is especially the case with several promising presale tokens, which have been generating considerable momentum and interest during their respective sales.</p>
<p>A strong example of such a coin is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $2.4 million in its increasingly successful sale.</span></p>

<p>As its name suggests, Bitcoin ETF Token has linked its tokenomics to the progress of Bitcoin ETFs, with the altcoin set to burn 25% of its max supply over time.</p>
<p>It will burn its supply in 5% instalments, each of which will be based around milestones reached by either Bitcoin itself or Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>For instance, it will hold its first 5% burn when a Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million, while it will execute its final burn when the BTC price equals $100,000.</p>
<p>This deflationary setup is also paired with staking, meaning that holders can earn a passive income while sitting on substantial price gains.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD">Shiba Inu price</a> has risen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $0.00000834 also representing a 2% gain in a week.</p>
<p>And while SHIB is down by 5% in a fortnight, it&#8217;s also up by 9% in the last 30 days, with data revealing yesterday that a new whale has withdrawn around $2.4 million in the meme token from Binance.</p>
<p>This suggests that an accumulation phase may have begun, and with most analysts expecting a bull run at the end of the year, SHIB could be in more for more rallies very soon.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Whale Withdraws $2.4 Million in SHIB From Binance – Secret Accumulating?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shiba Inu&#8217;s chart and indicators remain somewhat subdued, but the counter to this is that they may be ready for renewed growth.</p>
<p>For instance, SHIB&#8217;s 30-day moving average (yellow) has softened its ascent in the past week or so, a sign of diminishing momentum.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138365" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138365" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart.png" alt="Shiba Inu price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701432696-shiba-inu-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138365" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, the coin&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) has remained stuck at the 50 for just over a week now, suggesting that it&#8217;s having a hard time attracting new buyers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, its support level (green) has held up quite well since the middle of October, implying that the coin remains in a more bullish phase.</p>
<p>On top of this, data suggests that at least some whales have been accumulating SHIB in recent days, a sign that larger traders expect further gains soon enough.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Given that most analysts are expecting the entire market to rally early next year (because of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analysts-set-new-potential-window-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">potential Bitcoin ETF approvals</a>), SHIB is indeed likely to see gains in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>More importantly, Shiba Inu has witnessed a number of important updates and launches this year, all of which strengthen its fundamentals and put it in a position where SHIB can rise steadily.</p>
<p>This includes the launch of layer-two network Shibarium, which has provided the Ethereum-based Shiba Inu network with cheaper and faster transactions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Daily <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shibarium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#shibarium</a> transactions have increased from 16.6k yesterday to 748.2k today. Nothing suspicious about it at all. <a href="https://t.co/PcsVIjeVLf">pic.twitter.com/PcsVIjeVLf</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It also includes the launch of Shiba Inu&#8217;s own name service, which arrives as part of efforts to bring decentralized identity to the coin&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>Such features are all likely to increase adoption of Shiba Inu-based apps (e.g. ShibaSwap), and in turn increase demand for SHIB.</p>
<p>As such, the Shiba Inu price is likely to rise to $0.000010 in the next few weeks, before reaching $0.000020 within the first couple of months of 2024.</p>
<h2><strong>New Meme Tokens for New Rallies</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
But because SHIB continues to underperform (relative to major tokens), traders may be inclined to investigate newer alts and meme coins, with a number of presale tokens looking like they could rally significantly in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>A great example of this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised in excess of $2.3 million in its ongoing sale.</span></p>

<p>The platform will render these battles in real-time for users to watch, while the use of the Ethereum blockchain will make all results transparent.</p>
<p>Users place bets using the native MK token, which Meme Kombat will use to pay out winnings.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD">Cardano price</a> has seen a 2% bounce in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.382175 on a day when the wider crypto market has gained by 2.5%.</p>
<p>ADA is now down by 2% in the past week, yet the coin remains up by 32% in the last 30 days and by 55% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>However, despite such growth, data has revealed that only 35% of all ADA holders are actually in profit, a figure which provides some indication of how oversold the coin has been in recent months.</p>
<p>But with the market looking as though it will enjoy a good end-of-year rally, ADA may begin compensating for lost performance soon enough.</p>
<h2>Cardano Price Prediction as ADA&#8217;s Profitability Lags at 35% – Is $0.40 the Last Critical Resistance Before $1?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cardano&#8217;s chart is in a promising position, in that its indicators appear to be regaining strength again after a week or two of decline.</p>
<p>Its relative strength index (purple) has begun creeping back up to 60, signalling rising momentum while also leaving plenty of more space for further rises.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138317" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138317" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138317" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart.png" alt="Cardano price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701427618-cardano-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138317" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, ADA&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) continues to rise further above its 200-day (blue), a sign that the coin remains in the middle of a largely positive phase.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also welcome to see that the token&#8217;s support level (green) has risen consistently since the middle of October, implying that any incoming dip is likely to be minor and brief.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ADA&#8217;s trading volume remains noticeably lower than where it was in the first half of November.</p>
<p>It currently stands at just over $250 million, in comparison to $750 million a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>This suggests subdued interest in Cardano, with data released today also suggesting that now is not the best time for the altcoin.</p>

<p>As the tweet above shows, only a third of Cardano holders are in profit, with the coin struggling to decisively break the $0.38 resistance level.</p>
<p>Yet the expected bull market – stemming largely from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-nears-38k-bull-run-etf-hopes-up.htm">Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> – should help ADA pass this level in the next few weeks or months, and once it has, the coin&#8217;s fundamentals should kick in.</p>
<p>Indeed, Cardano as a blockchain has been growing steadily in 2023, with its total value locked in rising by over 400%, and with the total number of projects launched on its network passing 140.</p>
<p>As such, demand for ADA is likely to increase over time, pushing the coin to new levels.</p>
<p>The Cardano price should therefore rise to $0.50 in the early weeks of the year.</p>

<span style="font-size: 16px">Because ADA is something of a slow burner, many traders may prefer to look to newer tokens with more potential for posting quicker surges.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD">Litecoin price</a> has risen by 2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $70.94 as the cryptocurrency market gains by 2.5% today.</p>
<p>LTC is now up by 2% in a week and by 4% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also having risen by a very modest 1% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>While most major tokens overshadowing this year-to-date performance by a wide margin, LTC&#8217;s underperformance potentially means that it could rise faster than many other coins in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This is especially the case if 2024 brings a bull market, with LTC aiming to return to its all-time high of $410, set in May 2021.</p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Prediction as LTC Gains 2.16% in 24 Hours – Can This Uptrend Continue?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
What&#8217;s encouraging about LTC at the moment is that it has spent the past couple of weeks falling, meaning that a sustained a rally could be approaching.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) had been struggling to move beyond 50 since the middle of November, yet it has now clear this level and looks to rise to 60 (and beyond) on the way to further price gains.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138297" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-138297" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart.png" alt="Litecoin price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701424311-litecoin-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138297" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more tellingly, LTC&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has languished below its 200-day (blue) for numerous months, something which suggests that a prolonged rally is now overdue.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s hard to say when exactly this might come, given that the altcoin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume remains relatively subdued, at around $250 million.</p>
<p>This is much lower than the levels it saw earlier in November, when it reached a volume of $1 billion.</p>
<p>And it seems that any whales interested in LTC have been likelier to sell the coin than buy it, judging by available.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  78,980 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LTC</a> (5,426,325 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bittrex?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bittrex</a><a href="https://t.co/HE6HCjX81H">https://t.co/HE6HCjX81H</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Still, today&#8217;s gains suggests that a more bullish phase may be about to begin, with LTC joining the market as the latter enjoys a pre-Christmas push.</p>
<p>Once again, expectations regarding Bitcoin ETF approvals appear to be driving optimism, which have also combined with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-expected-to-take-dovish-stance-in-2024-with-over-100-basis-points-of-cuts.htm">signals that the Fed may actually cut rates next year</a>.</p>
<p>And LTC could potentially benefit more from accepted Bitcoin ETFs than many other alts, given that its relation to BTC may eventually lead to the opening of Litecoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Regardless, a bull market in 2024 is likely to push the Litecoin price higher, with the coin on course to reach $100 in the first couple of months of the new year.</p>
<h2>New Alts With High-Return Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Traders who aren&#8217;t entirely convinced by LTC may prefer to look towards newer alts, particularly those that are primed to rally big in the near future.</p>
<p>Such alts include presale tokens, which can often generate enough momentum during their sales to rally strongly once they list on exchanges.</p>
<p>One coin likely to do this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $2 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token has been generating plenty of buzz over the past few weeks, with its deflationary tokenomics the main reason for excitement.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it will burn 25% of its total max supply over time, with burns happening in 5% batches that will occur whenever Bitcoin reaches certain milestones.</p>
<p>Its first burn will take place when a Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million, while its last burn will happen when BTC itself reaches $100,000.</p>
<p>The token will also have a transaction burn tax that will decline to 0% by the time the whole 25% is burned, while holders will also be able to stake the coin for a passive income.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD">Dogecoin price</a> has dipped by 1% today, with its fall to $0.081625 coming as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has slipped by 0.5% in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Despite its drop, DOGE has posted a 7% gain in a week, helped along by the news that the &#8216;Doge-1&#8217; satellite mission has received regulatory approval from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</p>
<p>Funded entirely in dogecoin, the Doge-1 satellite will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and will broadcast ads back to Earth, with its development helping to boost interest in Dogecoin.</p>
<p>And given that DOGE is now up by 16%, Doge-1&#8217;s progress could help the meme token rise even further in the coming months.</p>

<figure id="attachment_137984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137984" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137984" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart.png" alt="Dogecoin price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701348635-dogecoin-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137984" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, DOGE&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) is still rising further above its 200-day (blue), again signalling that the coin remains in a bullish phase and is capable of rising further before losing momentum.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s particularly encouraging is that DOGE&#8217;s support level has risen consistently over the past month or so, something which indicates that the token isn&#8217;t likely to suffer any major dips on its way to future rallies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also positive that DOGE&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume remains relatively high at $800 million, which contrasts very favorably with the $150 million levels it saw in September and early October.</p>
<p>Such levels would suggest that whales remain interested in the token, with recent transfers showing that some large traders are still accumulating DOGE, sending it <em>off </em>exchanges.</p>

<p>This all creates a positive context for the news regarding the Doge-1 satellite, which has moved closer to launching after receiving approval from the NTIA.</p>
<p>The only thing left in terms of regulations is for it to gain approval from Federal Communications Commission, at which point it will be legally permitted to launch.</p>

<p>Either way, the Dogecoin price is likely to rise along with the wider market, which could have a strong end-of-year rally, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-speculation-sustains-bitcoin-price-how-long-will-it-last.htm">investors expecting Bitcoin ETF approvals</a>.</p>
<p>Based on this, DOGE could reach $0.1 in the next few weeks.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Meme Tokens With High-Return Potential</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The thing with DOGE, however, is that it remains too reliant on &#8216;external&#8217; factors to push up its price, and lacks the fundamentals and utility possessed by certain other coins.</p>
<p>Yet there are alts and even a few meme tokens in the market right now that do boast greater utility, with a number of presale coins available that look set to have big rallies when they list.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">This includes </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a>, <span style="font-size: 16px">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $2.2 million in its increasingly successful presale.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD">Solana price</a> has gained by 1.5% in the past hour, with the altcoin moving by 0% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>At $60.70, SOL has now risen by 5% in the past week and by 65% in the last 30 days, with its recent rise making it the fifth most-traded cryptocurrency in the market in terms of volume.</p>
<p>Much of SOL&#8217;s gains have come from traders returning to the token after it had a very bad 2022, yet it&#8217;s also clear that the rising use and adoption of the Solana blockchain is playing a key role.</p>
<p>This means that SOL should witness further gains in the coming weeks and months, particularly if the market enters a full-on bull phase next year.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction as SOL Becomes 5th Most-Traded Crypto in the World – Adoption Rising?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Solana&#8217;s chart and indicators continue to look very good, with the coin maintaining enough momentum for more rising in the near future.</p>
<p>Its 30-day average (yellow) has now risen well beyond its 200-day, suggesting that SOL&#8217;s recent rallies haven&#8217;t run out of steam yet and are likely to continue.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137957" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137957" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137957" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345963-solana-price-chart.png" alt="Solana price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345963-solana-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345963-solana-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345963-solana-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345963-solana-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345963-solana-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345963-solana-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137957" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, the coin&#8217;s RSI (purple) has risen over 60 and looks like it&#8217;s on its way back to 70, if not higher.</p>
<p>This would imply further price gains, and with SOL&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume now touching $2 billion, there&#8217;s certainly enough interest in the coin to sustain further increases.</p>
<p>Indeed, such volumes make SOL the fifth most-traded coin in the market, behind only Tether (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and USDC.</p>
<p>However, at the moment it seems that whales are leaning more towards selling the coin, as opposed to accumulating more of it.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  219,919 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SOL</a> (12,963,711 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a><a href="https://t.co/GtOtt1PYL4">https://t.co/GtOtt1PYL4</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Such bearishness would be in line with the rest of the market, and would imply that SOL may wobble a little more before it sees sustained rises again.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it has been one of the main beneficiaries of recent market-wide rallying, with its disproportionate gains largely stemming from disproportionate falls last year.</p>
<p>On top of this, the Solana blockchain has welcomed plenty of good news in recent months, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-payments-firm-visa-begin-using-solana-blockchain-for-stablecoin-settlements.htm">its inclusion in Visa&#8217;s stablecoin trials</a>.</p>
<p>It has also seen <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">its total value locked in rise</a>, while <a href="https://twitter.com/SOLbuckets/status/1726978133130457422">it has celebrated around nine months of continuous uptime</a> recently.</p>
<p>This points to good things for 2024, with the Solana price likely to follow.</p>
<p>Indeed, it could reach $100 within the first few months of the new year.</p>
<h2>Presale Tokens For Quick Market-Beating Gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While SOL remains probably the strongest major altcoin in the market right now, it isn&#8217;t the only alt likely to see big gains in the near future.</p>
<p>There are also a number of new alts currently holding their presales, which are providing them with plenty of momentum and attention before they list.</p>
<p>A good example of such a coin is <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised an impressive $2 million in its token offering.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token is one of the most interesting and exciting new tokens to have emerged this year, and the reason for this lies with its deflationary tokenomics.</p>
<p>It plans to burn 25% of its total max supply over time, with the platform burning in 5% instalments in parallel with the progress of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>For instance, it will burn its first 5% when the first approved Bitcoin ETF reaches a trading volume of $100 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">It&#8217;s hoped that such tokenomics will boost the price of the token, which holders can also use to stake for a passive income.</span></p>

<p>Investors can join its presale by heading over to <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>, where 1 BTCETF token now costs $0.0060.</p>
<p>Given that BTCETF has a max supply of only, and given that it will be aggressively burning this supply, its price is likely to rise much higher than this once it lists on exchanges.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD">XRP price</a> has dipped by 1% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.603258 as the wider crypto market suffers a 0.5% fall today.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp.htm">XRP</a> has now declined by 2% in a week and by 6% in a fortnight, yet the altcoin remains up by 4% in the last 30 days and by 77% since the start of the year.</p>
<p>And with its trading volume still close to the $1 billion mark, it&#8217;s attracting enough interest to manage further gains in the not-too distant future.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Prediction as $1 Billion Trading Volume Comes In – Can XRP Reach $1 This Week?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
XRP&#8217;s chart gives the impression that the coin may have to fall a little bit more before it will return to growth.</p>
<p>In particular its relative strength index (purple) is now falling below 50, suggesting that a descent to lower levels may be in order before recovery.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137943" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137943" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137943" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701343935-xrp-price-chart.png" alt="XRP price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701343935-xrp-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701343935-xrp-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701343935-xrp-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701343935-xrp-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701343935-xrp-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701343935-xrp-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137943" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, XRP&#8217;s 30-day moving average (yellow) has now almost completely flattened out, meaning that it may fall towards (or below) the 200-day average (blue) before we see further rallies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, XRP&#8217;s support level (green) remains higher than where it was in mid-October, something which suggests that any incoming falls will be fairly minor.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">Yet falls may come soon enough, given that the latest transfer data suggests whales are currently looking to sell XRP.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As such, we may indeed see the XRP price drop momentarily below $0.60 before things improve.</p>
<p>But improve they almost certainly should, given the overall medium-term trajectory of the market, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/valkyrie-anticipates-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etf-by-sec-this-month.htm">the expectation of Bitcoin ETF approvals</a> likely to continue buoying prices in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>More importantly, the bull case for XRP itself remains strong, with the coin benefitting from various legal victories for Ripple this year.</p>
<p>Firstly, Ripple secured a largely positive ruling in its case with the SEC, with the presiding judge deciding that sales of XRP on exchanges did not break securities laws.</p>
<p>Secondly, subsequent hearings have reinforced this decision, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-xrp-rockets-up-10-instantly-are-whales-buying.htm">a recent decision in the 2nd Circuit appeals court suggested that Ripple isn&#8217;t likely to face a hefty fine</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason, it will likely return to vigorous growth in 2024, with the XRP price following.</p>
<p>The latter could reach $1 in the first few months of the New Year.</p>
<h2>Diversification With New High-Potential Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">Given that XRP may have to wait for market-wide rallies before it can gain significantly, some traders may look to newer tokens which have the potential to post above-average returns in shorter timespans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">A prime candidate for doing this is </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, a stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $4.5 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p>In turn, users can spend these credits to purchase hashing power on the Bitcoin blockchain, thereby earning themselves a share of newly mined BTC.</p>
<p>This framework promises to democratize access to Bitcoin mining, while the use of staking also means that participants will earn a passive income.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD">Shiba Inu price</a> has risen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $0.00000831 coming as the wider crypto market posts a 2.5% gain today.</p>
<p>SHIB has now risen by 4% in a week and by 3.5% in the last 30 days, although the meme token has risen by only 2.5% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>This gain pales in comparison with the year-to-date returns posted by other major tokens (e.g. BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL), yet this year has seen <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-shiba-inu-coin.htm">Shiba Inu</a> introduce a number of important new updates, thereby strengthening its fundamentals in preparation for future gains.</p>
<p>And with lead developer Shytoshi Kusama outlining four future updates, 2024 could end up being a very big year for SHIB.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Four Major Updates Teased – Can SHIB Reach $10?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SHIB&#8217;s indicator currently find themselves in an uncertain position, consistent with either further gains or further falls.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) dropped to 50 over a week ago, and despite a slight increase in previous days looks like it&#8217;s stuck at the same middling level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137590" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137590" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137590" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701258436-shiba-inu-price-chart.png" alt="Shiba Inu price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701258436-shiba-inu-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701258436-shiba-inu-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701258436-shiba-inu-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701258436-shiba-inu-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701258436-shiba-inu-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701258436-shiba-inu-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137590" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>This could mean that it lacks the momentum to mount further gains anytime soon, as could its 30-day average (yellow), which is struggling to rise beyond its 200-day (blue).</p>
<p>It could also be significant that its support level (green) took a serious dive on November 21, implying that it may not be resilient against any further slips.</p>
<p>SHIB&#8217;s fortunes are likely to rest on the trajectory of the wider market, which could rise in the next few weeks, particularly if the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Yet this doesn&#8217;t mean that the Shiba Inu price won&#8217;t rise steadily in the more distant future, with the coin welcoming various key launches this year, including that for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/update-shiba-inus-shibarium-almost-ready-reopen-after-failed-initial-launch.htm">Shibarium</a> and for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-shibariums-shib-name-service-launch-nears-is-a-price-surge-expected.htm">its own name service</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And yesterday saw the release of an interview with Shytoshi Kusama, in which the developer discussed four areas in which SHIB is likely to see key updates in the coming months.</p>
<p>In particular, 2024 will see the Shiba Inu ecosystem pursue &#8220;absolute decentralization,&#8221; involving the introduction of more democratic governance across its four tokens and that of community-led elections.</p>
<p>On top of this, the developer also wants to provide SHIB with a more user-friendly UX and with more robust protection against scams, including self-sovereign identity and privacy measures.</p>
<p>So in theory, the introduction of such features, in addition to the eventual launch of SHIB: The Metaverse, could see the Shiba Inu price rise strongly in 2024.</p>
<h2>Other Alts With Strong Fundamentals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">While SHIB strives to boost its fundamentals, there are other alts in the market that look set to rally on the basis of strong utility.</span></p>

<p>Running on Ethereum, Bitcoin Minetrix will enable its users to mine Bitcoin (BTC) via the staking of its native token, BTCMTX.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>By staking BTCMTX, users receive mining credits which they can then redeem to purchase Bitcoin hash power.</p>
<p>In turn, this provides them with newly mined BTC, while staking will also earn them new BTCMTX.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSD">Terra Luna Classic price</a> has leaped by 28% today, surging to $0.00011781 as the wider market makes a more modest 3% gain in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This move means that LUNC is now up by 63% in the past week and by 79% in the last 30 days, with these increases helping to compensate the coin for a largely disappointing 2023 it has had up until now.</p>
<p>Recent developments and proposal acceptances within the Terra Luna Classic community is the primary reason for the recent gains, and with whales seemingly returning to the token after months of neglect, it could witness further rises in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as LUNC Jumps 28.50% – What&#8217;s Driving the Surge?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
LUNC is probably the strongest token in the top-100 (by market cap) at the moment, with its indicators all suggesting that it remains right in the middle of a breakout rally.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) touched 80 yesterday and remains at around 78, signalling considerable buying pressure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137557" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137557" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701254165-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png" alt="Terra Luna Classic price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701254165-terra-luna-classic-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701254165-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701254165-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701254165-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701254165-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701254165-terra-luna-classic-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137557" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more bullishly, its 30-day average (yellow) is about to climb over its 200-day average (blue), forming a &#8216;golden cross&#8217; that often indicates the onset of a breakout rally.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also encouraging that LUNC&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume is at its highest level in a year, standing currently at $333 million, in contrast to the sub-$20 million levels it witnessed a few months ago.</p>
<p>What such volume indicates is that larger traders are returning to LUNC, potentially accumulating the token again in anticipation of further increases.</p>
<p>Of course, whales can be unpredictable at the best of times, in that many buy up a token (particularly low-volume coins) in order to dump it for a profit at a later date.</p>
<p>Yet what&#8217;s promising about LUNC is that its community has made real progress in the past couple of weeks when it comes to supporting both it and its sister stablecoin, USTC.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In particular, its community accepted <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-rockets-up-50-in-24-hours-can-lunc-reach-1-soon.htm">a proposal to halt all minting and reminting of USTC</a> a week ago, paving the way for its price to rise gradually back up to $1.</p>
<p>While it certainly isn&#8217;t there yet, USTC has risen in price by more than 300% in a week, suggesting that it may have begun the long process of re-pegging.</p>
<p>As such, the Terra Luna Classic price is likely to reach $0.00020 by the start of 2024, helped on by other recently accepted governance proposals.</p>
<h2><strong>Alternative High-Potential Altcoins</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The only issue with LUNC right now is that, despite the possibility of another breakout, its current rally may have already peaked.</p>
<p>As such, some traders may prefer to look to newer alts that aren&#8217;t currently saturated, with some of the most promising alts in the market right now being presale tokens.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">For example, </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a> is <span style="font-size: 16px">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised more $2.2 million in its token offering, generating the kind of momentum and interest that could easily lead into a big opening on exchanges.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MEMERS!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>The reason why Meme Kombat has been successful is that it offers something pretty unique within the crypto sector, namely an online gambling platform that invites users to bet on AI-generated meme battles.</p>
<p>By using sophisticated AI algorithms and tech, Meme Kombat will generate and visualize (in real-time) battles between popular meme characters, with the results of such battles being fully transparent.</p>
<p>Users will be able to bet against the platform or each other, while they will earn MK tokens if they bet successfully.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">They will then be able to use such MK tokens for staking, earning them a passive income in the process, on top of any winnings (not to mention price appreciation for MK).</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And by using edgy and viral memes, Meme Kombat is already looking as though it&#8217;s attracting plenty of attention.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">Buyers can participate in the presale by </span>visiting<span style="font-size: medium"> the </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat official website</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, where 1 MK costs $0.214.</span></p>
<p>However, this will increase to $0.225 in just under two days, so interested investors should act sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD">XRP price</a> has gained by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.615287 on a day when the cryptocurrency market has risen by 3.5%.</p>
<p>Expectations of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-expected-to-take-dovish-stance-in-2024-with-over-100-basis-points-of-cuts.htm">Fed rate cuts as soon as the first quarter of 2024</a> are the main driver of today&#8217;s positivity, with XRP now up by 3.5% in the past week and by 10.5% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>The altcoin has also gained by 80% since the beginning of 2023, which has been a highly positive year for the token, providing it with ongoing momentum that&#8217;s likely to carry into further gains in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, some analysts are already pointing to key indicators which suggest XRP could break out very soon, with at least one suggesting the potential for a &#8220;parabolic&#8221; move very soon.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Prediction as Analyst Points to Critical Trendline Break – Is a Major Bullish Move Imminent?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One thing that could be said about XRP&#8217;s chart right now is that, after several weeks of correcting, it could be ready for a renewed rally.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) had fallen as low as 40 a week or so ago, but now it has just risen back to 50, potentially a sign of price rises to come.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137494" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137494" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701251070-xrp-price-chart.png" alt="XRP price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701251070-xrp-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701251070-xrp-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701251070-xrp-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701251070-xrp-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701251070-xrp-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701251070-xrp-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137494" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>And while XRP&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has seen its curve flatten a little in recent days, it continues to rise above its 200-day average (blue), a sign that the token remains in the middle of a broader period of growth.</p>
<p>The coin&#8217;s support level (green) also backs up this view, rising noticeably since October and preventing any fall back down to lower levels seen in previous months.</p>
<p>Analysts are also suggesting that XRP is due for further gains soon enough, with some hinting at the possibility of substantial rises.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In particular, the tweet above suggests that the XRP price rise exponentially if it can cross its eight-year trend line, which currently stands at around $0.90.</p>
<p>There remains every possibility that XRP could reach this level in the next few weeks, particularly if the wider market enters a distinct bull phase.</p>
<p>Such a phase could arrive sooner than some may anticipate, especially if the SEC approves a handful of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>On top of this, the Fed has revealed in recent days that it may begin cutting interest rates from early next year, which would provide another factor in renewed optimism.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Based on such potential developments, XRP is likely to reach $1 again within the first couple of months of 2024, which could see it test its record high by the close of the year if a full bull market ensues.</p>
<h2>New Altcoins With High Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Yet because XRP is a highly established token, many traders may also be interested in diversifying into newer alts, particularly those that stand on the brink of big initial rallies.</p>
<p>This means that traders should consider investigating presale tokens, since the most successful of these generate so much momentum during their offerings that they end up having profitable exchange listings.</p>
<p>A strong candidate to do just this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $1.9 million in its sale.</span></p>

<p>Bitcoin ETF Token has quickly emerged as one of the most exciting and interesting new coins in the market, for the simple reason that its tokenomics will be aggressively deflationary.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it will link its tokenomics to the progress of real-world Bitcoin ETFs and to BTC itself, with the coin planning to burn 25% of its total supply over time.</p>
<p>It will do this in 5% blocks, with each 5% burning coming when Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs reach certain milestones.</p>
<p>The first such milestone relates to Bitcoin ETFs attaining a trading volume of $100 million, while the last will arrive when BTC hits a price of $100,000.</p>

<p>By proactively restricting its supply like this, Bitcoin ETF Token will boost relative demand and, in turn, its price.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD">Dogecoin price</a> has fallen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $0.078079 after the number of non-zero DOGE wallet addresses passed the 5 million mark yesterday.</p>
<p>DOGE is now up by 1.5% in a week and by 13% in the last 30 days, with the meme token up by a relatively modest 11% since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>This pales in comparison with some of the gains recorded by bigger coins (e.g. BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL) since January, yet the news of Dogecoin wallets reaching 5 million underlines the coin&#8217;s potential as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>And with the Dogecoin community still hoping that next year may see X add DOGE payments to its network, the original meme coin could witness big gains in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Prediction as Adoption Grows to 5 Million Wallet Addresses – Can DOGE Reach $10?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While many analysts are expecting a strong end to the year, DOGE&#8217;s chart looks like it may have begun a medium-term comedown after November&#8217;s market-wide exuberance.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) has dropped below 60 and looks like it will reach 50 in the next few days, meaning that further losses may be in store for the meme token.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137138" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137138" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137138" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701173379-dogecoin-price-chart.png" alt="Dogecoin price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701173379-dogecoin-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701173379-dogecoin-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701173379-dogecoin-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701173379-dogecoin-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701173379-dogecoin-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701173379-dogecoin-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137138" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, DOGE&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) continues to rise higher than its 200-day (blue), which is usually a sign that an asset remains in the middle of a phase of growth.</p>
<p>Reinforcing this view is the token&#8217;s support level (green), which has risen in recent weeks and has prevented <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">DOGE</a> from falling below the $0.070 level.</p>
<p>As such, today&#8217;s decline may be short-lived, with DOGE&#8217;s trading volume at around $600 million today.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Indeed, whales are still accumulating the token, so it may be in store for further rises fairly soon.</p>
<p>This will depend on the overall trajectory of the market, however, with the mood largely based on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/valkyrie-anticipates-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etf-by-sec-this-month.htm">the progress of Bitcoin ETF applications</a>.</p>
<p>Such applications will receive a decision in January, meaning that DOGE – along with the market – may see its biggest rallies in recent memory around then.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Dogecoin price is more or less wholly reliant on X, which may eventually bring in cryptocurrency/DOGE payments at some undefined point in the future.</p>
<p>Such a payment feature could be popular, given that <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1729185397404582305">there are now roughly five million Dogecoin wallet addresses holding some DOGE</a>, testifying to the enduring popularity of the coin.</p>
<h2><strong>Newer Meme Tokens For Newer Rallies</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Because DOGE has relatively underperformed this year, traders may be inclined to investigate alternative meme tokens, particularly newer coins that have yet to have their initial breakthrough rallies.</p>
<p>The prime candidates for such rallies include presale tokens, which can often generate substantial momentum during their sales, momentum that is then converted into big listing rallies.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">One token likely to enjoy such rally is </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised just over $2.2 million in its token offering.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>This figure attests to the considerable interest Meme Kombat has generated over the past few weeks, with the platform due to launch in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>When it launches, it will enable users to place bets on AI-generated battles between popular meme characters, with these battles rendered in real time for users to watch.</p>
<p>Users can place bets against each other or against the platform, which will pay out winnings in its own native token, MK.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Users can also use MK for staking, making the token potentially very lucrative.</span></p>
<p>It has a total max supply of 120 million, with 50% of this going to the sale and another 30% going to battle and staking rewards.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD">Cardano price</a> has dipped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.374679 on a day when the market as a whole has suffered a 1% loss.</p>
<p>ADA is now down by 2% in a week, but remains up by 3.5% in the past fortnight and by 27.5% in the last 30 days, with the coin also having risen by 52% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Such gains help to put today&#8217;s little dip in a wider context, showing that ADA retains considerable medium- and long-term momentum, and that it should rally again soon enough.</p>
<h2>Cardano Price Prediction as ADA Drops Below $0.38 – Is a Rebound on the Horizon?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
ADA&#8217;s indicators are currently showing signs of slight weakness, yet the overarching trend still remains mostly bullish.</p>
<p>For example, even though ADA&#8217;s RSI (purple) has declined noticeably from the high levels it reached in early November, its actual price hit a seven-month high only two days ago.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137088" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137088" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137088" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701169578-cardano-price-chart.png" alt="Cardano price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701169578-cardano-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701169578-cardano-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701169578-cardano-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701169578-cardano-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701169578-cardano-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701169578-cardano-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137088" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>This suggests ongoing strong momentum, as does the coin&#8217;s 30-day moving average (yellow), which continues to put more distance between itself and the 200-day average (blue).</p>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">ADA</a> is still in the middle of a bull phase, and while it may have been bought heavily earlier in the month, previous overselling justifies a prolonged period of growth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also arguable that ADA&#8217;s current position is bullish in the sense that it has come about without heavy involvement from whales, implying that when larger traders do begin accumulating ADA, it may move dramatically.</p>
<p>And while ADA isn&#8217;t currently a favored coin among whales, it continues to strengthen its position fundamentally, with its network growing steadily.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">its total value locked in has risen by 420% since the start of the year</a>, while that of SOL – which remains a favorite for bigger investors – has grown by only 184%, despite a 450% price rise since January.</p>
<p>It also continues to see more launches on its blockchain, with its network now supporting 149 launched apps and platforms.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As such, the Cardano price can really only go up in the near and more distant future, especially when traders had oversold for so long.</p>
<p>It could reach $0.50 by 2024, with a fully-fledged bull market next year potentially pushing it back up to $1.</p>
<h2>New High-Potential Alts Promise Big Rallies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Given that ADA&#8217;s progress in recent months has been mostly gradual, many traders may prefer to consider newer alts which show more potential for quicker, above-average rallies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">One of the most exciting new altcoins emerging right now is </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, a stake-to-mine platform that has raised more than $4.4 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p>As a stake-to-mine platform, Bitcoin Minetrix enables you to mine actual Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native BTCMTX token.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>The way this works is that staking provides users with tokenized mining credits, which they can then spend on Bitcoin hash power.</p>
<p>This means that mining takes place on their behalf, with those who stake enough BTCMTX earning BTC in return.</p>
<p>They will also earn new BTCMTX when they stake, making Bitcoin Minetrix a potentially very profitable platform.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>It will also be easy to use, providing an extremely low barrier of entry for anyone who has ever wanted to mine BTC but has lacked the technical savvy to do so.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD">Solana price</a> has dipped by 1% in the past 24 hours, falling to $55.47 in a move that also represents a 1% loss in a week.</p>
<p>Yet SOL remains up by an impressive 71% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also recording a 450% increase since January 1.</p>
<p>This makes it the best-performing top-100 cryptocurrency over this period, and with the coin carrying largely holding onto this momentum over the past month, it&#8217;s likely that it will witness more gains in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction as 70% Gains in 30 Days Outpaces Competitors – Can SOL Keep Its Momentum?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite recent losses, SOL continues to maintain considerable strength, with its indicators all in positions that point to incoming gains.</p>
<p>Its relative strength index (purple) has stopped falling after a difficult time last week, and is now nearing 60 again, potentially as a prelude to more rising.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137046" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137046" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701165196-solana-price-chart.png" alt="Solana price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701165196-solana-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701165196-solana-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701165196-solana-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701165196-solana-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701165196-solana-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701165196-solana-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137046" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>No less encouragingly, SOL&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) continues to rise further above its 200-day (blue), implying that it remains in the middle of an expansionary, bullish phase.</p>
<p>And given that the average continues to rise, it doesn&#8217;t like this phase is going to an end anytime soon.</p>
<p>This view receives support from the coin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume, which remains fairly high at $1.3 billion, compared to $200 million back in September.</p>
<p>Indeed, SOL currently stands as the most heavily traded alt among funds, with the coin often leading even Ethereum (ETH) in terms of weekly inflows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crypto funds total $326 million of net inflows last week</p>
<p>Biggest inflow since July 2022<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SOL</a> leading the move </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Such demand ultimately stems from the fact that Solana&#8217;s fundamentals have improved considerably this year.</p>
<p>This is in terms of adoption, as indicated by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-payments-firm-visa-begin-using-solana-blockchain-for-stablecoin-settlements.htm">Visa&#8217;s inclusion of Solana in its stablecoin trials</a>, and also in terms of core updates to its network.</p>
<p>For instance, 2023 has seen Solana register nearly ten months in continuous uptime, after 2022 was marred by numerous unfortunate outages.</p>
<p>Based on such factors, the Solana price will continue rising in the foreseeable future, reaching $75 by 2024.</p>
<h2>Other High-Potential Alts With Strong Fundamentals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As bullish as SOL looks at the moment, it may not continue rising for much longer, meaning that traders looking for the biggest gains may be better off putting their money with other tokens.</p>
<p>This includes presale coins, which can often rally big when they list for the first time, particularly when they&#8217;ve attracted lots of funding.</p>
<p>One potential example of this is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $1.9 million in its increasingly popular presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Investors are increasingly putting their faith with Bitcoin ETF Token because of the coin&#8217;s very interesting tokenomics, which link up with Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>That is, Bitcoin ETF Token will burn 5% of its total max supply when BTC reaches certain milestones, with the first coming when the SEC approves a spot-based Bitcoin ETF for the first time.</p>
<p>Other burns will come when the first ETF is finally launched and when Bitcoin itself reaches a price of $100,000, with BTCETF set to burn a total of 25% of its supply over time.</p>
<p>By burning such a large chunk of its supply, BTCETF is likely to become a highly deflationary cryptocurrency.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinETF</a> incorporates a 5% burn tax on every transaction, leading to a gradual reduction in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Token?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Token</a> supply as time progresses.</p>
<p>The plan is to burn 25% of the tokens as specific milestones are achieved aiming to alleviate selling pressure. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/odZwrPDn0D">pic.twitter.com/odZwrPDn0D</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And generally, deflationary tokenomics imply a steadily rising price over time, which explains why investors are flocking to the coin&#8217;s presale.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">New investors can join by visiting </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a> and connecting one of their software wallets.</p>
<p>1 BTCETF token now costs $0.0060, yet the presale price will rise again in five days, while it could surge once it lists on exchanges, particularly when its first milestone is reached.</p>

<p>PEPE100 (PEPE100x) has jumped 50x overnight, with the new meme token reaching a record high of $0.00386 several hours ago.</p>
<p>This makes it the latest in a seemingly endless string of new meme coins to enjoy big opening rallies on Uniswap this year, yet it seems that PEPE100&#8217;s time is already up.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has actually dropped by around 84% since posting its record high, with the plunge looking like a good old fashioned dump.</p>
<p>However, while the coin does seem prematurely finished, there are other new altcoins in the market that offer genuine fundamentals, with Bitcoin ETF Token&#8217;s increasingly successful presale suggesting that it could rally big soon.</p>
<h2>PEPE100 Leaps 50x Overnight</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
PEPE100&#8217;s chart really does provide a textbook example of how a picture can be worth a thousand words, with the red candle on the right-hand side of the chart indicating that the coin is about to die as quickly as it was born.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136677" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136677" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701085878-pepe100-price-chart.png" alt="PEPE100 price chart." width="2560" height="919" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701085878-pepe100-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701085878-pepe100-price-chart-300x108.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701085878-pepe100-price-chart-1024x368.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701085878-pepe100-price-chart-768x276.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701085878-pepe100-price-chart-1536x551.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701085878-pepe100-price-chart-2048x735.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136677" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>The above pattern – a steep rise followed by flatlining and then a steep drop – is the classic pump-and-dump chart shape, with there likely being 0% chance of the coin making a recovery.</p>
<p>Indeed, with only <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xb0bb164a91ffd22bf1c79e67b89eb8e38204b7cd">304 holders</a> (as of writing) and a daily volume of approx. $15,330, it&#8217;s pretty clear that PEPE100&#8217;s sole function was to extract wealth from the unfortunate traders who thought they could somehow beat the coin&#8217;s issuer(s).</p>
<p>Well, most have likely failed in such an endeavor, yet they have at least provided a salutary lesson in which tokens <em>not </em>to buy if a trader wants a decent chance of making a profit.</p>
<p>Instead, investors should look to new alts with some kind of use case or fundamental underpinning, which provide users and traders with a reason for buying it and continuing to buy it.</p>
<p>Such coins may be few and far between in a sea of new junk tokens, yet there are a number of notable exceptions.</p>
<h2>This Hidden Crypto Just Surpassed $1.8 Million in Funding – 100x Possible?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One of the most promising right now is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $1.8 million in its ongoing presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The reason why Bitcoin ETF Token is such a promising project is that it has designed its tokenomics to be considerably deflationary.</p>
<p>Even more interestingly, it has incorporated a burn mechanism which is triggered whenever Bitcoin (BTC) reaches particular milestones, with the token set to burn 25% of its supply over time.</p>
<p>It will execute such burning in stages, with the first 5% up for destruction when the SEC approves a spot-based BTC ETF for the very first time.</p>
<p>The final 5% will be burned when BTC attains a price of $100,000, a level it could reach as soon as next year, if some bulls are to be believed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinETF</a> Stage 5 is wrapping up in just 1 day!</p>
<p>Stay alert! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f31f.png" alt="🌟" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/6eRzXfrSs7">pic.twitter.com/6eRzXfrSs7</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On top of this, Bitcoin ETF Token also includes a burn tax on all transactions, which will start at 5% and gradually reduce to 0% in parallel with its one-off burn events.</p>
<p>This makes it a highly deflationary token, which accounts for why so many investors are joining its presale.</p>
<p>New buyers can do the same by going to <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>, where 1BTCETF token sells at <span style="font-size: 16px">$0.0058.</span></p>
<p>This sale price will rise incrementally today, while it could climb much higher once the token lists on exchanges and its burn mechanism kicks in.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BLURUSD">BLUR price</a> has dropped by 13% in the past 24 hours, with the utility token falling to $0.521296 as investors take profits following its Binance listing on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite the drop, BLUR remains up by 53% in a week and by 134% in the last 30 days, as the altcoin – the native token of NFT platform Blur – attempts to return to its all-time high of $5.</p>
<p>It recorded this price back in February, very soon after Blur released the governance and community token, yet has struggled to regain the same momentum.</p>
<p>However, there are newer tokens which look set to recreate its strong opening, with new stake-to-mine platform Bitcoin Minetrix holding an increasingly successful presale.</p>
<h2>Is Blur Going to Zero? BLUR Price Dips 13%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BLUR&#8217;s indicators have suffered a little after its dip today, suggesting that a bigger correction may be needed before the altcoin can return to growth.</p>
<p>Its RSI (purple) has dropped from an overbought 80 a few days ago to 60 today, and its direction suggests that it could sink further soon enough.</p>

<p>On the other hand, its 30-day average (yellow) continues to climber higher above its 200-day (blue), something which indicates that the coin is still in the middle of an upcycle, even if it&#8217;s dipping today.</p>
<p>Its 24-hour trading volume would support this view, in that it stands at around $200 million, representing a 400% increase from where it was at the end of October.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems that whales and other large traders have taken a fancy to BLUR, with a number of recent transactions showing that many are still accumulating the token.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As such, BLUR could continue to rise again in the next few weeks, even if it&#8217;s taking a hit at the moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely to retain much of the momentum from <a href="https://fr.cryptonews.com/news/prix-blur-explose-suite-son-listing-sur-geant-binance.htm">its Binance listing</a>, which saw it rise by as much as 20% in a few hours on Friday.</p>
<p>And while BLUR does actually remain down by 89% compared to its ATH, its native platform continues to hold a promising position within the NFT market.</p>
<p>DappRadar continues to rank it as the biggest NFT marketplace in the entire sector in terms of trading volumes, leading its rivals in the past day, week and month.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For this reason, a new bull market could see the BLUR price rising much higher, especially if the NFT market picks up considerably along with it.</p>
<p>It could reach $0.60 in the next few weeks, and then $0.70 by the first few weeks of 2024.</p>
<h2>Surprising New Bitcoin Mining Project Goes Viral – How Does it Work?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">While BLUR has been recovering some of its lost value over the past few days, it may struggle to recapture the bullishness it had back in February, meaning that traders pursuing above-average gains may have to look elsewhere for now.</span></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a variety of promising new altcoins in the market right now, with several presale tokens having the potential to rally big once they list.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">At the top of this list is </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised well in excess of $4 million in its increasingly popular token offering.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What makes Bitcoin Minetrix appealing to investors is that it offers something fairly rare within the crypto sector: a stake-to-mine platform.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>This means that its users can participate in Bitcoin mining by staking its native token, BTCMTX.</p>
<p>Such staking provides them with tokenized mining credits, which they can then use to effectively pay miners to mine Bitcoin (BTC) on their behalf.</p>
<p>Accordingly, staking enough BTCMTX can therefore earn users newly mined BTC, on top of new BTCMTX.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, Bitcoin Minetrix offers a streamlined and simple user interface, meaning that pretty much any cryptocurrency holder at any level could use it to earn BTC.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSDT.P">Terra Luna Classic price</a> has surged by 50% in the past 24 hours, with its jump to $0.00011916 coming on a day when the cryptocurrency market as a whole has actually fallen by 1.5%.</p>
<p>LUNC is now up by 84% in the last 30 days, making it one of the best-performing top-100 coins over this period.</p>
<p>It seems that traders are buying the altcoin in response to even more impressive surges from associated stablecoin USTC, which <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-27-terraclassicusd-terra-axie-infinity.htm">has ballooned by nearly 300% today</a>, on the basis of re-peg proposals that now seem to be taking effect.</p>
<p>As such, LUNC could potentially see even if further gains in the coming days and weeks, compensating for the heavy losses it has incurred this year.</p>
<h2>Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as LUNC Rockets Up 50% in 24 Hours – Can LUNC Reach $1 Soon?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a coin that has accelerated by 50% in a day, it&#8217;s no surprise to see that LUNC&#8217;s indicators are all in highly bullish positions.</p>
<p>Its relative strength index (purple) has just touched 80 and looks like it could peak at close to 90 before the current rally loses steam.</p>

<p>LUNC&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has also begun climbing rapidly, with the indicator set to overtake the 200-day average (blue) very soon, something which can indicate further breakouts.</p>
<p>Perhaps most bullish of all is the coin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume, which has gone from under $20 million to over $600 million almost overnight.</p>
<p>This increase suggests that whales have finally returned to the token, buying it up in larger quantities and triggering a more general rally.</p>

<p>Of course, with whales it&#8217;s never certain what kind of endgame they might have, in that they may ride LUNC for only a short time, or could just as conceivably end up holding it for the long haul.</p>
<p>The Terra Luna Classic community would certainly like to think it will be the latter, and it&#8217;s possible that it could be, at least judging by recent developments with regards to re-pegging USTC and boosting LUNC&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>Indeed, USTC has risen to $0.066342 overnight, helped by recent proposals to limit its supply.</p>
<p>For example, last week saw the acceptance of a plan to halt all minting of USTC, meaning that its supply is likely to decline over time, especially in conjunction with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-terra-website-gets-hacked-will-lunc-keep-falling.htm">earlier proposals to burn the stablecoin</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Such proposals have now resulted in a situation where burn totals for both LUNC and USTC have reached their highest levels to date.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Terra Luna Classic price is likely to continue rising, potentially reaching $0.00020 by the end of the year.</p>

<p>As a stake-to-mine platform, Bitcoin Minetrix will enable its users to mine actual Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native BTCMTX token.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Staking BTCMTX will earn users mining credits, which they can then spend on Bitcoin hash power, in turn earning themselves mined BTC.</p>
<p>This could make Bitcoin Minetrix a very profitable platform, as could the fact that users who stake will also receive newly issued BTCMTX.</p>
<p>As a token, BTCMTX has a max supply of four billion, with 1.4 billion going to the sale.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD">Solana price</a> has recorded a 1% gain in the past 24 hours, in line with a similar return for the market as a whole today.</p>
<p>At $58.32, SOL has now risen by just over 6% in the past week, with the altcoin also posting an 18% gain in a fortnight and a very impressive 81% jump in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>This makes SOL the best-performing top-20 token across these periods, with available data suggesting that institutions and funds are becoming more interested in the token.</p>
<p>As such, it&#8217;s likely to continue rising over the next weeks, possibly seeing out the year with a strong bull rally.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction as SOL Gains 6.65% in Third Week of November – Will the Bullish Momentum Continue?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Based on an examination of SOL&#8217;s indicators and chart, the altcoin continues to find itself in good form, with its momentum continuing.</p>
<p>Its 30-day average (yellow) is still rising further above its 200-day (blue), a sign that its ongoing growth spurt still isn&#8217;t likely to come to an end very soon.</p>

<p>Additionally, SOL&#8217;s RSI has one again climbed above 60, another indicator of good buying pressure that has space left to intensify.</p>
<p>Other positive signals include its trading volume, which remains at around $1 billion, way above the $150 million levels it registered in August and September.</p>
<p>Such volumes highlight the fact that interest in SOL continues to be strong, with a whale alert today revealing that a large trader has transferred around $25 million in SOL away from Kraken.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is a bullish sign, insofar as it indicates that the token remains in an accumulation phase, with more price increases on the cards.</p>
<p>Indeed, as we&#8217;ve written before, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-tops-altcoin-fund-inflow-with-13-6-million-last-week-is-sol-the-new-investor-favorite.htm">SOL is currently the most popular altcoin in terms of fund inflows</a>, even outperforming Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>It therefore makes sense to suggest that further market-wide rallies will continue to be led by Solana, which has had an excellent 2023.</p>
<p>This is evident in <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">its rising total value locked in</a>, as well as in <a href="https://twitter.com/SOLbuckets/status/1726978133130457422">the 100% continuous uptime it has had since the start of the year</a>.</p>
<p>As such, the Solana price will continue rising in the coming weeks, potentially reaching $80 by 2024.</p>
<h2>New High-Potential Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The only issue with SOL is that it&#8217;s so hot at the moment that it&#8217;s in danger of becoming too hot, meaning that it may slow down from here on out.</p>
<p>Traders wary of this possibility may be inclined to invest in newer alts, especially younger alts which still have their first breakout rallies to look forwards to.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">This includes such a token as </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $1.5 million in its increasingly successful presale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin ETF Token has been winning over investors by virtue of its novel tokenomics, which are linked to Bitcoin and the progress of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>It will burn 25% of its total max supply over time, destroying a 5% tranche whenever Bitcoin reaches a certain milestone.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">The cryptocurrency will burn its first</span> 5% when the SEC approves a spot-based Bitcoin ETF for the first ever time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">This burn tax will further reduce its supply, with the final 5% block set for burning when BTC reaches a price of $100,000.</span></p>
<p>All of this makes Bitcoin ETF Token one of the most aggressively deflationary tokens in the market, which perhaps explains why investors are flocking to its sale.</p>

<p>New investors can join  the sale at <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">the official Bitcoin ETF Token website</a>, where they can buy BTCETF by connecting their crypto wallets and using either ETH, USDT. BNB or fiat currency..</p>
<p>Its presale price is currently $0.0058, yet this will rise in just under four days, while it could rally massively once it lists on exchanges after the sale ends.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LINKUSD">Chainlink price</a> has moved by 0.5% today, with its rise to $14.54 coming as the cryptocurrency market gains by 1% in 24 hours.</p>
<p>LINK has now risen by 6.5% in the past week and by more than 16% in the last three weeks, with the altcoin also rising by 31% in a month.</p>
<p>This makes it one of the best-performing major tokens of these periods, and with the Chainlink network continuing to expand and attract more usage, LINK is likely to witness further gains in the near and more distant future.</p>
<h2>Chainlink Price Prediction as LINK Surges 16.6% in Two Weeks – Can LINK Reach $100?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
LINK&#8217;s chart reveals the altcoin in good momentum, potentially on the brink of another round of gains.</p>
<p>This impression comes mainly from its relative strength index (purple), which after having fallen to 50 at the start of the week is now rising again.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136161" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136161" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700823229-chainlink-price-chart.png" alt="Chainlink price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700823229-chainlink-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700823229-chainlink-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700823229-chainlink-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700823229-chainlink-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700823229-chainlink-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700823229-chainlink-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136161" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Such rising suggests an increase in buying pressure, as does LINK&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow), which also continues to rise further above its 200-day average (blue).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">What&#8217;s particularly encouraging at the moment is that the coin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume continues to record elevated levels, standing at over $600 million after falling as low as $150 million in late August and early September.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A significant chunk of this volume is likely coming from whales accumulating LINK, as suggested by recent data on whale transfers.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why (larger) traders are buying LINK right now: 1) the market remains in an expansionary phase after months of stagnation; and 2) LINK is one of the strongest altcoins in the market in terms of its fundamentals.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Chainlink oracle network – which provides validated data to other blockchains and platforms – continues to expand, providing over 11 billion data points and facilitating $9 trillion in transactions to date.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing this bizarre repeated claim that Chainlink only has four price feeds</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Such growth has driven demand for native token LINK, which is likely to continue rising as the market ends the year strongly.</p>
<p>From its current position at around $14.50, it&#8217;s likely to reach $20 by the start of 2024, with a fully fledged bull market potentially pushing it as high as $40 in the next few months.</p>
<h2>New Altcoins With Strong Potential for Gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px">LINK does look very promising right now, yet traders who wish to maintain diversified portfolios may also be advised to look into newer tokens, which can often rally ahead of market averages.</span></p>
<p>This is particularly the case with presale coins, which in raising substantial funding can generate enough interest to lead into big rallies once they list on exchanges.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">One token likely to do this is</span><span style="font-size: 16px"> </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, a stake-to-mine platform that has raised $4.3 million in just over a month.</span></p>

<p>Bitcoin Minetrix has been winning over investors by virtue of its unique platform, which will enable users to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native BTCMTX token.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Such a system will remove many of the barriers that have prevented average cryptocurrency holders from participating in mining, with users not required to buy mining equipment or anything like that.</p>
<p>Staking Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s native token will also earn users newly issued BTCMTX in return, making the platform potentially highly lucrative.</p>
