<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/118939/316603/blockchain.jpg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Blockchain technology brings decentralization to financial transactions, breaking down the closeted procedures embraced by traditional finance. The result is the blossoming of transparent ledgers that store data about financial transactions, enabling anybody from anywhere to view them. Blockchain transparency breeds a fair system where the control remains with users, preventing the occurrence of corrupt practices. Ergo, transactional data published and stored on blockchain ledgers is immune to manipulation. Those looking at them are served information with the utmost integrity.</p><p>These benefits can be brought to all financial applications by integrating them with blockchain networks. For example, the use of blockchain technology for online casino platforms brings transparency to the transactions and data relayed between them and their users. The latter can rely on the on-chain data to learn the status of their bets, winnings, game statistics, and so on. Blockchain transparency prevents players from falling prey to dishonest behavior.</p><p>The Fairspin online casino brings these benefits to gambling enthusiasts with its blockchain-powered platform. It uses Trueplay&rsquo;s solution, ensuring data transmission from the platform to the blockchain, where it is verified, and Trueplay Explorer, where it is displayed in real time for everyone to see. Such a solution enables the flow of genuine information, depicting withdrawals and deposits, bets, earnings, and much more.</p><h2>Crypto and Blockchain Casinos</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The contrast between Fairspin and other &ldquo;crypto&rdquo; and &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; casinos is its reliance on blockchain technology. Most other online casinos hiding behind those terms simply use cryptocurrency to accept deposits and make payments. All other processes occur opaquely within closed silos, forcing users to trust such platforms blindly. Without transparency in their processes, casinos can resort to dishonesty, manipulate data, and prevent users from walking away with their winnings.</p><p>Here is where <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">blockchain-based casinos</a> like Fairspin are revolutionizing the online casino space. The transparency it breeds keeps users away from other online casinos that choose not to reveal their operations. Why risk losing funds to possible bad actors when an entirely see-through platform exists?</p><p>Fairspin also leverages blockchain technology to bring users loyalty programs in true blockchain-finance fashion with its TFS Token. The programs are an added layer of incentives, allowing users to earn beyond their gambling efforts. Like gambling on the platform, these loyalty programs are underpinned by absolute transparency.</p><h2>How Blockchain Usually Works</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>To understand how casinos are offered transparency by blockchains, it is requisite to know how blockchains function. Essentially, they are databases of financial transactions hosted on a set of nodes distributed worldwide. Every transaction recorded on a blockchain ledger is validated by its nodes and approved through a process of majority consensus. Thus, fraudulent transactions are recognized and weeded out. Legitimate transactions, once approved, make it to blocks. Each block holds a specific amount of data, is cryptographically hashed, and cryptographically linked to the blocks before and after it. Altering any single transaction on any block will change the status of all the blocks after it, notifying everyone on the network and preventing a full-scale takeover.</p><p>If a bad actor wants to control a blockchain network, they must possess resources amounting to at least 51% of what is held by all its nodes. However, gaining that amount of resources to hack an entire network is very expensive and near impossible with networks secured by multiple nodes.</p><h2>How Blockchain and iGaming Intersect on Fairspin</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Fairspin utilizes this technology as its base, bringing decentralization to the mix. Data from the casino is displayed to its users upon verification via the Trueplay technology, making its financial records immutable, accurate, and reliable.</p><p>While some casinos use fake lucrative winnings to attract users to their platforms, every win on Fairspin is verifiable. One player won 63,302.4 MBTC ($1,226,076.59) in September 2022. Another person won $250,000 in April 2022, and one more gained over $550,000 in February 2022. The massive wins were instantly recorded on Trueplay Explorer, and people can view them right now.</p><h2>Fairspin&rsquo;s TFS Token Powers Its Loyalty Programs</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Alongside blockchain&rsquo;s transparency and fairness, Fairspin also uses the technology for novel incentivization measures. The casino brings loyalty programs, rewarding those who use them despite their winning or losing positions. In contrast, other online casinos only incentivize users through rakeback when they place losing bets to keep them from leaving.</p><p>Fairspin&rsquo;s loyalty programs come in two flavors &ndash; Play to Earn and Hold to Earn. Play to Earn allows users to earn rakeback in TFS as they play games on the platform. The rewards are offered instantaneously to users&rsquo; accounts after they place their bets.</p><p>Players can further stake these TFS Tokens via the platform&rsquo;s Hold to Earn program and earn more returns on the same asset. Users lock their tokens in the holding pool over various periods and draw rewards. The Hold to Earn program is a no-risk initiative, letting users draw up to a whopping 500% APR without worries of losing the TFS they deposit. Even if the program offers no returns, users can always withdraw their deposits in entirety at the end of the holding period.</p><h2>Summing Up</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>With the benefits the <a href="https://fairspin.io/"><u>Fairspin</u></a> blockchain casino provides, it has become a go-to option for thousands of users worldwide. Those valuing the safety of their assets and fair processes are already exploring all the casino offers, including on-chain data on Trueplay Explorer. With transparent statistics for users to observe, they are finding a better gambling experience on Fairspin.</p><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fairspin-review.htm">Fairspin review</a></li></ul>

Concurrently, it develops the game concept, establishes a presence on various social media platforms, and launches the pre-sale website, all of which have been successfully accomplished. In Phase 2, significant progress is made with the launch on Uniswap, listings on CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko (CG), and securing listings on top-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs). The introduction of DogeHub, an innovative gaming platform, along with influencer marketing campaigns to expand the user base and engage a wider audience, is also part of this phase. Additionally, the launch of DogeWin takes place.</p><p>Phase 3 focuses on key initiatives such as the release of exclusive Doge Rush NFTs and subjecting the platform to third-party audits, with Certik being the primary auditor. Forming partnerships with major CEXs is also a key objective during this phase. In the fourth and final phase, the aim is to secure listings on major exchanges to ensure broad accessibility. Additionally, the goal is to establish partnerships with renowned gaming studios, fostering collaborations that enhance the gaming experience provided by Doge Rush.</p><h2>A Meme Coin for the Ages</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Doge Rush is definitely worth monitoring closely. The ongoing presale presents an opportunity to get involved with this token at an early stage, making it advisable to join without delay. With its significant utility, Doge Rush holds substantial potential.

The site claims a high win rate and doesn&#8217;t ask for any commission or any other fee to use its facility.&nbsp;</p><p>But is the platform truly legitimate? Or is it the same scam-ridden website design to phish your personal info? This Bitcoin Gemini review touches upon the different features of this platform to see if it meets the needs of crypto traders.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bitcoin Gemini Summary</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin Gemini claims to be a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-trading-bots.htm">cryptocurrency trading robot</a> with a low risk approach, making it easier for investors to trade in crypto without having to monitor the markets. Helping in this regard is the supposedly integrated machine-learning tool that scans the market and does the trade on an investor&rsquo;s behalf. Before we begin the review, here are some key elements to understand.</p><figure class="table" style="float:left;width:468pt;"><table><tbody><tr><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;"><strong>Trading Type</strong></td><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;">Crypto</td></tr><tr><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;"><strong>Success Rate&nbsp;</strong></td><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;">Not available</td></tr><tr><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;"><strong>Cryptocurrencies Available&nbsp;</strong></td><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;">Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, EOS, MIOTA, NEO, BNB, XRP, ETC, ADA, ZCASH</td></tr><tr><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;"><strong>Available on Mobile&nbsp;</strong></td><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;">Mobile app not available</td></tr><tr><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;"><strong>Customer support&nbsp;</strong></td><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;">Email or phone &#8211; Accessible only after depositing the required amount</td></tr><tr><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;"><strong>Withdrawal Speed</strong></td><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;">24 hours</td></tr><tr><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;"><strong>Minimum Deposit&nbsp;</strong></td><td style="border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;">$250</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Bitcoin Gemini</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Cryptocurrencies are unregulated.

The machine-learning-enabled mechanics of this site are apparently capable of making market-beating returns in the current volatile space.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/110399/267395/bitcoin-gemini-app.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/110399/267395/responsive-images/bitcoin-gemini-app___media_library_original_544_160.jpg 544w, https://cimg.co/news/110399/267395/responsive-images/bitcoin-gemini-app___media_library_original_300_88.jpg 300w" width="544" class="content-img"></figure><p>Helping in this endeavor is its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">AI trading bot</a> that scans the market to find the best investment opportunities. That said, many reviews say that advanced traders can also customize the app to set the buy and sell price for maximum benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>Highlighting this utility are the claims that major brokers have joined hands with Bitcoin Gemini. The site also suggests its unique approach to finding repeatable patterns in the price charts helping users get a high win rate. Although the historical information of the same is not available.&nbsp;</p><p>Another highlight that Bitcoin Gemini has claimed is that it does not ask for any transaction fees for withdrawals and deposits. There is no commission applicable as well &#8211; but you might need to pay the broker integrated with the platform and not the platform itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, from what we could gather from this website, the site seems user-friendly. And while the site doesn&rsquo;t have a mobile app, it does claim to provide Web Trader facilities that make it responsive, which means mobile phone users won&rsquo;t have to worry about any issues.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Bitcoin Gemini</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p><h2>Bitcoin Gemini Pros and Cons</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>There are the positives and the negatives that we found while creating our Bitcoin Gemini review:</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li>Supports 14 cryptocurrencies</li><li>Has a fee-free structure</li><li>Claims to have partnered with brokers</li><li>It says that a demo account is available</li><li>Claims a high success rate</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li>Historical information about the success rate is not available</li><li>No information is available about the makers of the website.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How does Bitcoin Gemini Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin Gemini works the same way as the leading crypto platforms that use a machine-learning-based approach to offer high returns on investments for their clients. Investors can create an account and start trading using one of the listed crypto assets, including leading coins to altcoins.&nbsp;</p><p>Once a user creates an account, the in-built tools of the platform start scanning the market, looking for the best trading opportunities to trigger a trade. To enter a position, Bitcoin Gemini claims that it looks for tokens that have reached the bottom and are predicted to bounce back. The platform starts seeking to close the position by assessing the market conditions to learn if crypto has peaked. It then closes the position on its own, giving profits to the users.&nbsp;</p><p>The platform claims that this profit-generating process goes on round the clock.&nbsp;</p><p>As the cryptocurrency market is volatile and traders face new situations every day, Bitcoin Gemini also offers educational resources that you can use to stay updated. These resources also keep users informed on how the platform works and how to level up their trading strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, users&rsquo; funds on the platform are stored with a third-party broker, to which Bitcoin Gemini orders to execute trades. However, the platform claims that it can&rsquo;t directly access your account &#8211; which is a positive when you consider the importance of keeping your assets secure.&nbsp;</p><p>Payouts on the platform are also supposedly fast, only taking up to a day to get cleared.</p><h2>Bitcoin Gemini Key Features</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Listed below are the key features that Bitcoin Gemini claims it offers traders:</p><h3>Supports Multiple Cryptocurrencies</h3><p>Bitcoin Gemini claims to support a wide array of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Gold, and multiple other cryptocurrencies. Trading using these cryptocurrencies is simple, and users apparently don&#8217;t need any technical knowhow before getting started.&nbsp;</p><h3>Advanced trading mechanics</h3><p>Assessing the crypto markets takes time, and the rapid pace at which the prices change is hard to keep up with. Bitcoin Gemini claims that it uses advanced machine learning mechanics to get the most success in trading. It says that the platform has been correct most of the time when it comes to generating profits for its users. While the historical data about the performance of this platform is not available at the moment, current information suggests that it may leverage the volatility of the crypto space to generate many gains for users.&nbsp;</p><h3>Demo Trading Facility Available</h3><p>Bitcoin Gemini claims that it provides a demo trading mode as well as live trading. The platform says that people can switch between the two easily whenever they feel like it. All the facilities are supposedly available via the online dashboard &#8211; something that we weren&rsquo;t able to see since access to it is only possible after depositing the required amount.&nbsp;</p><p>With demo trading, users can get used to a platform and assess it&#8217;s every nook and cranny before starting to trade for real. And with the rapid switch that Bitcoin Gemini claims it has, one can switch to demo trading whenever the win rate falls.&nbsp;</p><p>The platform suggests that it only takes 30 minutes to find the best parameters to get successful results.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Bitcoin Gemini</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p><h2>Bitcoin Gemini Account Fees</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Getting started on Bitcoin Gemini is apparently free of charge; the platform doesn&#8217;t even ask for a commission. In addition, according to Bitcoin Gemini testimonials there are no deposit of withdrawal costs associated with this platform.&nbsp;</p><h2>Minimum Deposit on Bitcoin Gemini</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>To start trading on Bitcoin Gemini, you need to deposit at least $250. All the facilities that Bitcoin Gemini will only open to you once you deposit this required deposit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bitcoin Gemini Compatible Devices</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin Gemini is only available as a web application. However, our reviewers tested it on the following platforms and found the results to be satisfactory.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Mobile</li><li>Laptops</li><li>Tablets</li></ul><h2>Is Bitcoin Gemini a Scam or Legit?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Let us now answer one question that most people have been asking &#8211; is Bitcoin Gemini a scam or legit?</p><p>Bitcoin Gemini claims a lot, its high 90% winrate does sound unsustainable and we were unable to find any independent verification or backtesting of that success rate. What we could only find were third-party accounts and reviews making similar grand claims. Investors are therefore advised to exercise caution when accessing this website.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the platform has received reviews on Trustpilot. However, the reasons regarding it have been mixed. Some say that they were able to gain advertised returns, while others are painting a mediocre picture of the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the platform is light on information, which can be seen as a red flag to many. Considering those factors, we can&rsquo;t specify whether this platform is legit or a scam. However, going by the interactiveness of this platform, the UI works, which may likely be the same for the charting tools.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bitcoin Gemini Customer Support</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin Gemini claims that users can get in touch with the expert via email at any time. However, the platform doesn&rsquo;t have a contact us page or customer support information. So, it is likely that those who created the account are the only ones who could get in touch with the customer support team.&nbsp;</p><p>As we signed up, we were contacted by an account manager. So, it is likely that after you complete the whole process, you will get access to the support team.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Begin Trading with Bitcoin Gemini</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Once you have read through all the features of the website and have independently researched its legitimacy, follow these steps to start trading on the website.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 1: Visit the Bitcoin Gemini Website</h3><p>The first step is to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-gemini/"><u>navigate to the official Bitcoin Gemini platform</u></a> and open an account. You will need to enter your name and phone number. The customer representative will call you afterward to help you through the account creation process.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/110399/267394/bitcoin-gemini-signup.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/110399/267394/responsive-images/bitcoin-gemini-signup___media_library_original_407_424.jpg 407w, https://cimg.co/news/110399/267394/responsive-images/bitcoin-gemini-signup___media_library_original_300_313.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="407" class="content-img"></figure><p>Bitcoin Gemini traders must be 18 years of age or over.</p><h3>Step 2: Deposit the Minimum Amount</h3><p>Once you have created your account, fund it using any of the listed fiat methods. Bitcoin Gemini claims that all the traditional ways to create an account, such as debit/credit card or visa card, are supposed on this platform. Bank transfer is also available, but the speed might be a bit slow.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 3 &#8211; Start Trading on Bitcoin Gemini</h3><p>After you have funded your account, assess the market conditions using the charting tools and let Bitcoin Gemini scan the crypto markets and trading pairs of your choice, such as BTC/USDT. You can customize the trading conditions if you are an experienced trader, and start with the demo account if you are a beginner.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Bitcoin Gemini</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Cryptocurrencies are unregulated.

The likes of Blackrock use Alibaba, and other trading machines have also gained relevance in the past. Instances like these have given air to rumors that Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder, might be using Bitcoin Gemini. However, we couldn&rsquo;t find anything to support that statement.&nbsp;</p><h3>Does Elon Musk use Bitcoin Gemini?</h3><p>Elon Musk is known to be a friend of the crypto space, with his bullishness about Dogecoin that has caused the memecoin&rsquo;s price to rise so many times. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he uses Bitcoin Gemini or any <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-robo-advisors.htm">robo advisor</a> type tool.&nbsp;</p><h3>Does Martin Lewis use Bitcoin Gemini?</h3><p>There is no evidence anywhere online that would suggest that Martin Lewis, a popular financial journalist with<i>MoneySavingExpert</i>, uses Bitcoin Gemini or similar crypto trading platforms.</p><h2>Who Created Bitcoin Gemini?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>No information is available on the website about the creators of Bitcoin Gemini. The About Us page is absent, and the contact us page is not here as well. Anonymity is common in the crypto space. But it might be seen as a red flag considering the rising demand for more transparency. Investors are recommended to do their own research before proceeding to use this platform.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bitcoin Gemini Payment Methods</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Listed below are the payment methods supported on the site:</p><ul><li>Debit Cards</li><li>Credit Cards</li><li>E-wallets</li></ul><h2>The Verdict</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Our team of reviewers went through different portions of this website when assessing Bitcoin Gemini. While the platform is extremely light on information &#8211; and no detail has been provided about the team behind it, we believe that things may get clearer after users deposit the requested amount. That said, it is easy to sign up on the platform &#8211; which is good news for those who want to start early.&nbsp;</p><p>And when researching, we did find multiple testimonials about this website &#8211; and our reactions regarding those are mixed. Therefore, invest in Bitcoin Gemini only after doing your own research.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Bitcoin Gemini</a></div></div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Cryptocurrencies are unregulated.

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p>
<h2>What is Immediate Experience? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As well as being a crypto trading bot tool to automatically enter and exit trades on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Immediate Experience site appears to offer a range of technical analysis (TA) tools, indicators and a calendar of fundamental analysis (FA) considerations.</p>
<p>While most of the detail on the Immediate Experience robot is reserved for depositors, the website states for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Find out the most important financial events to take place in the coming year when you use the economic calendar. Or switch between different chart views to know more than just the price of the asset.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Immediate Experience crypto bot review team were unable to verify the accuracy of the platform and no auditing or backtesting information is made available to the public. We recommend only investing what you can afford to lose &#8211; remember all trading carries risk.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Using a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-trading-bots.htm">crypto robot</a> like Immediate Experience has its advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<p><strong>Pros </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aimed at beginners to the auto crypto trading sector</li>
<li>Said to outperform human traders</li>
<li>Trending on Facebook, Reddit trading forums</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Few screenshots, video tutorials, instructions available before making a deposit</li>
<li>Founders are anonymous</li>
<li>Not regulated</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does Immediate Experience Work? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-auto-trading-platforms.htm">Automated trading platforms</a> like Immediate Experience are usually proprietary and don&#8217;t reveal precisely how their algorithmic trading setup works, the coding behind their API, historical price performance, etc.</p>
<p>The Immediate Experience cryptocurrency platform does claim however that an account manager is made available for those that sign up, who can &#8216;<i>point out the trading opportunities that meet your trading preferences and parameters.</i>&#8216;</p>
<h2>Immediate Experience Key Features</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As mentioned in our Immediate Experience platform review, little information is made available before creating an account. However these appears to be the main features of this auto trading tool:</p>
<h3>Beginner Focused</h3>
<p>The Immediate Experience website focuses on helping new traders to build up &#8216;confidence in Bitcoin trading&#8217; and allow them to get started in the markets in &#8216;no more than a few minutes&#8217;. On this site we&#8217;ve also written a newbie&#8217;s guide on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-get-into-crypto.htm">how to get into crypto</a> this year.</p>
<p>Experienced traders are also said to be well catered to and able to get something out of using the Immediate Experience software.</p>
<h3>Variety of Bitcoin Trading Pairs</h3>
<p>Alongside Ethereum and the major altcoins by market capitalization, Immediate Experience allegedly supports several BTC trading pairs, which we&#8217;d expect to include BTC/USDT (trading against Tether) as well as fiat currency pairs.</p>
<h3>Variety of Crypto Analysis Tools </h3>
<p>Alongside autonomously trading crypto (automatically, after some calibration by the end user) the Immediate Experience platform includes a range of trading tools, information and data to &#8216;<i>back up your trading analysis</i>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Also see our reviews of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-tools.htm">best crypto tools for research and analysis</a>, as some Immediate Experience alternatives.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.</i></p>
<h2>Immediate Experience Fees</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While Immediate Experience fees are subject to change, they currently appear to be:</p>
<figure class="table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="border: 1pt solid #000000;padding: 5pt;vertical-align: top">Trading Fees</td>
<td style="border: 1pt solid #000000;padding: 5pt;vertical-align: top">Depending on the exchange or broker used</td>

</figure>
<h2>Immediate Experience Minimum Deposit </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Immediate Experience website states that at the time of writing the min. deposit is $250, which is used as initial trading capital for the robot tool and can be withdrawn.</p>
<p>This is in line with other crypto trading bots including similarly named automated trading platforms we&#8217;ve reviewed on this site such as Immediate Edge and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/immediate-connect-review.htm">Immediate Connect</a>.</p>
<h2>Immediate Experience: Compatible Devices</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Not much information is provided yet on the website as to whether there is an official Immediate Experience app for Android and iOS. Currently it appears to be a desktop platform, primarily. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/103942/255344/auto-crypto-trading-platform.jpg" alt="Immediate Experience trading platform" /></figure>
<p>There is reportedly however a web mobile app, i.e. some support for users on handheld devices to use Immediate Experience on the go.</p>
<h2>Is Immediate Experience a Scam? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To determine whether Immediate Experience was legit, we reviewed the platform website, the available features, and various online reviews and testimonials. It&#8217;s difficult however to prove one way or another if a given automated trading program is legitimate.</p>
<p>We recommend only depositing the minimum principal capital and testing out the cashout process early on before committing to a large real money deposit.</p>
<h2>Immediate Experience Customer Support</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Unlike some Bitcoin bots the Immediate Experience program states it provides a dedicated account manager to assist traders get started with Immediate Experience. In addition it appears to contact those that express an interest by email and telephone, based on the fields on their registration form.</p>
<h2>How to Use Immediate Experience</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Those that do decide to proceed and open an account with Immediate Experience can take the following steps:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Visit the Immediate Experience Website</h3>
<p>There appear to be several <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/immediate-experience/en"><u>Immediate Experience website</u></a> landing pages set up to generate leads &#8211; use one of the links on this page to browse the site homepage.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/103942/255345/immediate-experience-crypto-site.jpg" alt="Immediate Experience website" /></figure>
<p>Fill in the Immediate Experience sign up form in the top right corner with some personal details.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Deposit Funds</h3>
<p>At the time of writing new Immediate Experience trading bot users are required to make an initial deposit of $250+ to begin using the software.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Start Trading Cryptocurrencies </h3>
<p>Full instructions on how to trade with Immediate Experience are said to be sent to new signups by email, although our review team did not make a deposit to test Immediate Experience out with live trading.</p>
<h2>How to Delete a Immediate Experience Account? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Immediate Experience platform site states it does not store personal user information and there appears to be no account login feature.</p>
<h2>Do Any Celebrities Use Immediate Experience? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Some crypto trading bots claim to be endorsed by famous people, and often this can be a red flag of a scam. The Immediate Experience website currently does not use any false branding or list any ambassadors of its program.</p>
<h3>Does Jeff Bezos use Immediate Experience? </h3>
<p>No, the former Amazon CEO has not stated he uses any crypto robot tool and often websites that mention an Amazon token or Amazon crypto bot are fraudulent.</p>
<h3>Does Elon Musk endorse Immediate Experience? </h3>
<p>While the Tesla and SpaceX founder has endorsed Bitcoin and Dogecoin he has not stated he uses any particular crypto exchange or crypto bot tool.</p>
<h3>Does Martin Lewis use Immediate Experience? </h3>
<p>The MoneySavingExpert writer Martin Lewis has been neutral on cryptocurrency and Bitcoin and not mentioned any connection to Immediate Experience.</p>
<h2>Who Created Immediate Experience? </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Immediate Experience was developed by an anonymous team. It&#8217;s common among crypto trading bot tools for the founders to not be doxxed, and remain private as the industry is largely unregulated and their API and algorithms tend to be closely guarded in their setup.</p>
<h2>Immediate Experience Payment Methods </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Immediate Experience appears to accept the industry standard deposit methods such as VISA, bank transfer, and cryptocurrencies the trader already holds.</p>
<h2>The Verdict </h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our review of Immediate Experience was unable to verify the legitimacy of the platform as most detailed information is only made available to those who create an account and deposit, delivered by the personal broker that contacts the user and acts as an agent.</p>
<p>This can be a sign of a scam so we recommend proceeding with caution and not investing more than the minimum until having made a withdrawal successfully.

<p>On Monday Edward Snowden tweeted &#8216;<i>for the first time in a while I&#8217;m starting to feel the itch to scale back in</i>&#8216; with the Bitcoin price around $16,500.</p>
<p>The former NSA and CIA agent added one caveat: &#8216;<i>There&#8217;s still a lot of trouble ahead</i>.&#8217;</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price did rally in the hours following his tweet, now up 4% in the past 24 hours. </p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s still a lot of trouble ahead, but for the first time in a while I&#39;m starting to feel the itch to scale back in. <a href="https://t.co/saZXYq8MT2">pic.twitter.com/saZXYq8MT2</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1592168811075366913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>After four days of FUD surrounding the bankruptcy and shady dealings of FTX exchange and Alameda &#8211; which Snowden has also been commenting on &#8211; could a short term bounce be due?</p>
<h2>Edward Snowden&#8217;s Last Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Snowden added a price chart with his tweet, showing the last time he made a similar <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin prediction</a> near a bear market bottom.</p>
<p>On March 13th, 2020 &#8211; the day the Bitcoin price dropped to $3,782 in the infamous covid crash &#8211; he tweeted:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the first time in a while I&#39;ve felt like buying bitcoin. That drop was too much panic and too little reason.</p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1238375969267814402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He was right then, as after taking that liquidity Bitcoin pumped to $65,000 in May 2021 and then $69,000 in November, its all time high.</p>
<p>His gut is now telling him the worst of the crypto winter is over, and short of some &#8216;<i>trouble</i>&#8216; &#8211; perhaps some sideways chop and consolidation &#8211; it&#8217;s a good time to buy Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He added a follow up tweet in his usual humble style &#8211; &#8216;<i>this is not financial advice and I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing</i>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Snowden has however been a long-term follower of cryptocurrency and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">participated in the creation ceremony of privacy coin Zcash</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>This week Edward Snowden has also tweeted:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8216;<i>And they call *me</i>*<i> a criminal</i>&#8216; (in response to Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lies and deleted tweets)</li>
<li>&#8216;<i>Custodial exchanges were a mistake&#8217; (</i>shortly before FTX exchange was shown to be insolvent, and rumors then swirled over Crypto.com)</li>
<li><i>&#8216;The White House sanctions and arrests kids for the &#8220;crime&#8221; of building privacy tools to protect you, while &#8220;regulators&#8221; were quietly palling around with the thieves who just robbed 5 million people. The difference? The thieves were big political donors.&#8217; </i>(referring to Tornado Cash and Gary Gensler)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its all-time high the Bitcoin price has retraced as low as $15,500 on November 9th, an almost 80% correction.</p>

Luckily, we have done the research for you.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are five upcoming projects to buy as an early investor.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Top 5 Upcoming NFT Projects to Buy as an Early Investor</h2><span class="replacer"></span><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cockynft.io/?utm_source=CryptoNews&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=Cocky"><u>Cocky</u></a> &#8211; An exclusive lifestyle club providing access to world-class music events</li><li>YogaPetz &#8211; A collection of NFTs focused on Yoga and mindfulness</li><li>ArtGobblers &#8211; A novel art project for NFT artists</li><li>Probably A Label &#8211; A promising web3 music platform</li><li>MetaBeat &#8211; A music NFT project focused on K-Pop.</li></ul><h2>A Closer Look at the Top 5 Upcoming NFT Projects to Buy as an Early Investor</h2><span class="replacer"></span><h3>Cocky</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cockynft.io/?utm_source=CryptoNews&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=Cocky"><u>Cocky</u></a> is an exclusive lifestyle club that grants all of its NFT holders access to world-class music events. Suppose you&rsquo;re a fan of electronic music and enjoy traveling to unconventional locations across the globe. In that case, the Cocky Can NFT is an upcoming project for you to buy as an early investor.</p><p>Their NFT collection consists of 10,000 Cocky Can NFTs that depict a soda can with 51 different skin variations. In addition to the skin variations, Cocky Can NFTs also come with three different colored lids to represent the different tiers of benefits received by the holder. The lids can come in Silver, Gold, or Black.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222530/cocky-nft.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222530/responsive-images/cocky-nft___media_library_original_394_244.jpg 394w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222530/responsive-images/cocky-nft___media_library_original_300_185.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="394" class="content-img"></p><p>Depending on your tier, you are entitled to the following benefits as an NFT holder;</p><ul><li>Accommodation provided by Cocky at their events</li><li>Subsidized transport to get to the event</li><li>Additional invites to bring along friends</li><li>Bar tabs to enjoy at the event</li><li>Exclusive merchandise</li></ul><p>In addition, one lucky holder will randomly receive a black Cocky Can NFT, which is the rarest in the collection. The holder of this NFT will receive VIP benefits at Cocky events for perpetuity.&nbsp;</p><p>Cocky has created an exciting and novel feature for their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/utility-nft-projects.htm">utility NFTs</a>, dubbed Mutations. These Mutations are stamps that appear on the background of the NFT each time the holder attends one of the Cocky events or participates in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mutations allow holders to write their own stories on their NFTs regarding their journey through the Cocky ecosystem, eventually making every NFT totally unique over time. The NFTs with the most mutations are likely to be the most sought after and will become highly desirable as time progresses.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222532/cocky-nft-project.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222532/responsive-images/cocky-nft-project___media_library_original_777_401.jpg 777w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222532/responsive-images/cocky-nft-project___media_library_original_720_371.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222532/responsive-images/cocky-nft-project___media_library_original_600_309.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222532/responsive-images/cocky-nft-project___media_library_original_300_154.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="777" class="content-img"></figure><p>One great feature regarding the Cocky events is that they occur in unconventional locations. Their shows won&rsquo;t be held in muddy farmer&rsquo;s fields or run-down warehouses. Instead, all Cocky events are held in prestigious locations that pay a particular focus on the location&rsquo;s landscape, culture, and history.</p><p>Due to the inherent capacity restrictions at these locations, ticket volume will be issued depending on the venue&rsquo;s capacity. Therefore, Cocky Can NFT holders must quickly register their interest in attending the events.</p><p>If a Cocky holder receives a ticket and cannot attend, they will have the opportunity to sell their ticket on the custom-built secondary market. However, to level the playing field and provide extra utility, only those with a Cocky NFT are eligible to purchase a ticket on the secondary market.</p><p>Cocky plans to host at least two in-person events annually, with additional regular virtual events. Cocky has the goal to grow its community by throwing bigger and better events over time. Eventually, they hope their events will become as famous as top-tier festivals such as Coachella, opening up their ticketing to the general public. However, the VIP benefits will still only ever be reserved for their Cocky Can NFT holders.</p><p>The NFTs are scheduled to be minted on the Ethereum Network sometime in Q4 2022, providing you with the opportunity to buy into the project as an early investor. Keep an eye on their social media accounts for additional announcements.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cockynft.io/?utm_source=CryptoNews&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=Cocky"><u>VISIT COCKY TODAY</u></a></p><h3>YogaPetz</h3><p>If you&#8217;re a fan of Yoga and meditation, then YogaPetz is a project for you to invest in. YogaPetz is a collection of 10,000 NFTs that are all centered on a balanced life, true self, and mindfulness.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the NFT collection, the project consists of an exclusive membership club, a Breath-to-Earn game, and a metaverse called the Yogiverse.</p><p>Each YogaPetz NFT provides a residency to the owner in the YogaPetz resort members club. There, YogaPetz owners can hang out, heal, and explore spiritual concepts with one another. Being a member of the club provides the following benefits;</p><ul><li>Access to the exclusive Discord server</li><li>Access to the YogaPetz marketplace</li><li>Access to the Breath-to-Earn game</li><li>Attend in-personal events</li><li>Participate in exclusive giveaways</li></ul><p>The team behind YogaPetz has over 10 years of experience in developing mobile applications. As a result, they have released a web3 lifestyle app with social-fi and game-fi mechanics. The game allows Yogis, the game&#8217;s players, to earn tokens by learning, practicing, and exercising in Yoga.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222533/yogapetz-nft.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222533/responsive-images/yogapetz-nft___media_library_original_778_361.jpg 778w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222533/responsive-images/yogapetz-nft___media_library_original_720_335.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222533/responsive-images/yogapetz-nft___media_library_original_600_279.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222533/responsive-images/yogapetz-nft___media_library_original_300_139.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="778" class="content-img"></figure><p>Furthermore, their Breath-to-Earn game allows YogaPetz owners to earn $PRANA by playing the game. Users simply have to follow the breathing exercises set out in the in-game instructions and complete the correct breathing techniques to earn $PRANA.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, YogaPetz also has a metaverse called the Yogiverse. This will be the central location for the YogaPetz Resort and will allow all NFT owners to come together to build the resort, which will become a place for mindfulness practice with guided meditations and sound baths. The team has enlisted a handful of wellness advisors to lead the resort and provide professional services in the metaverse.</p><h2>Art Gobblers</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Art Gobblers is a novel experimental, decentralized art factory created by Justin Roiland and Paradigm.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222535/art-gobblers.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222535/responsive-images/art-gobblers___media_library_original_774_476.jpg 774w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222535/responsive-images/art-gobblers___media_library_original_720_442.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222535/responsive-images/art-gobblers___media_library_original_600_368.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222535/responsive-images/art-gobblers___media_library_original_300_184.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="774" class="content-img"></figure><p>The entire project&rsquo;s mission is to build a self-sustaining ecosystem centered around creating and collecting the coolest art in the universe.</p><p>The project released a Draw Tool, which allows artists to come to the platform to draw their own artwork on-chain. The Draw Tool is similar to a web-based version of Microsoft Paint, and it works on a desktop or iPad, providing all the tools that skillful artists would require to create their own art pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>Once an art piece has been created, the system turns it into a 1/1 NFT using in-game resources. Then, one of the 2000 Gobbler NFTs will eat the new art and display it in the belly gallery forever;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222536/art-gobblers-nft.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222536/responsive-images/art-gobblers-nft___media_library_original_733_321.jpg 733w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222536/responsive-images/art-gobblers-nft___media_library_original_720_315.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222536/responsive-images/art-gobblers-nft___media_library_original_600_262.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222536/responsive-images/art-gobblers-nft___media_library_original_300_131.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="733" class="content-img"></figure><p>Each Art Gobbler NFT produces Goo tokens, which are used to create the blank pages that are required to produce the art. The more Goo a Gobbler has in its tank, the faster it generates more Goo.&nbsp;</p><p>2,000 Art Gobbler NFTs will be initially minted. However, over the next 10 years, players will create 8,000 more Gobblers by spending Goo &#8211; creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>The system is designed to mimic a flywheel where artists make cool art, causing the cultural relevance of Art Gobblers to grow. As a result, Gobbler art will be in higher demand from collectors, causing artists to produce cooler art.&nbsp;</p><p>The initial Gobbler mint consists of 2,000 fully animated Gobblers, which can all Gobble the art drawn by artists. If you previously bought one of Justin Roiland&rsquo;s previous NFT collections, you are eligible to enter the raffle for a mint list spot. The mint is expected at some point in September 2022.</p><h3>Probably A Label</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222537/probably-a-label-nft.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222537/responsive-images/probably-a-label-nft___media_library_original_773_496.jpg 773w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222537/responsive-images/probably-a-label-nft___media_library_original_720_461.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222537/responsive-images/probably-a-label-nft___media_library_original_600_384.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222537/responsive-images/probably-a-label-nft___media_library_original_300_192.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="773" class="content-img"></figure><p>Probably A Label is a new type of record label that is on a mission to change the definition of Intellectual Property ownership in the music industry by utilizing web technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The project was birthed through a partnership with a major record label called Warner Record and a Web3 company called ProbablyNothing. Together, they aim to create a hybrid of the traditional label that can interact with today&rsquo;s method of music consumption.&nbsp;<br><br>Their main goal is to change how IP is viewed and utilized by combining it with technology such as NFTs to elevate the way that people consume music.&nbsp;</p><p>The project ecosystem consists of two separate sections; Studio A and Studio B.</p><p>Studio A is the intellectual property incubator for all Probably A Label NFT pass holders. It was created to help pass holders bring their content to life by accepting concepts using NFTs from approved projects, including;</p><ul><li>Bored Ape Yacht Club</li><li>Crypto Punks NFTs</li><li>Doodles</li><li>Women And Weapons</li><li>StickemenToys</li><li>PhotoSynths</li><li>DegenToonz</li></ul><p><br>Probably A Label pass holders whose submissions are accepted in the incubator will gain access to resources such as financing, marketing, creative development, partnerships, branding, and PR.&nbsp;</p><p>Studio B is a community-driven music library that is built to democratize discovery in the music industry. It allows all pass holders to submit tracks to Studio B that can consist of major musicians or up-and-coming artists.</p><p>All the live music in Studio B can be used on collaborative projects led by holders, allowing them to use the music in different productions such as documentaries and movies. The collaborative ecosystem is designed to reward creatives and make discovering their music more accessible through collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Probably A Label is trying something different in the sector by combining the traditional label with new technologies and making a decentralized ecosystem for NFT holders.</p><h3>MetaBeat</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222538/metabeat-nft.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88562/222538/responsive-images/metabeat-nft___media_library_original_756_568.jpg 756w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222538/responsive-images/metabeat-nft___media_library_original_720_540.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222538/responsive-images/metabeat-nft___media_library_original_600_450.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88562/222538/responsive-images/metabeat-nft___media_library_original_300_225.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="756" class="content-img"></figure><p>MetaBeat is a platform designed to strengthen the relationship between fans and music artists. It is a global K-Pop music content IP platform that has created a total Fan-to-Earn (F2E) ecosystem.</p><p>The entire platform was created around the K-Pop industry, which has grown exponentially over the past five years. In K-Pop, the engagement from fans is very high, and Metabeat seeks to capitalize on this by providing fans with a way to earn through the economy.</p><p>The project has three primary features; Drop, Mingle, and Shout-Out.</p><p>MetabBeat helps the actual transaction of copyrights through ownership of NFTs. The Drops can be generated by music albums, singles, metaverse concerts, or fan meetings. Users purchase these Drops through the MetaBeat platform and can enjoy the benefits of ownership if they can get their hands on them.</p><p>The Mingle feature allows users to share the rewards of copyright through the NFT trading option. It also opens the door for fractional ownership of the NFT. Furthermore, users can stake $BEAT tokens to support their favorite artists and receive rewards.</p><p>The Shout-Out feature helps artists recognize their fans&#8217; value by paying compensation according to their &#8220;Fandom Index&#8221; score. In short, you get rewarded for becoming a loyal fan of your favorite K-Pop artist. The rewards are provided in $BEAT tokens, and the platform offers missions and challenges to earn additional tokens.</p><p>All NFTs are purchased through the MetaBeat marketplace. In addition, the platform offers an application that can be downloaded on Google Play or the iOS store.</p><p>MetaBeat has seen investment from top venture capital firms such as Neo Global Capital Ventures, AC Capital, and KuCoin Labs.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>All of these upcoming projects provide fantastic opportunities to purchase NFTs to become an early-stage investor in the project. In addition, they all have the capacity for some serious growth ahead of them if their teams can deliver on their proposals.</p><p>However, in our opinion, the best project to buy as an early investor is certainly the Cocky Can NFT collection. This project is redefining the value of utility in the NFT space by providing real-world access to in-person, world-class music events. Holding this NFT provides both investment growth potential and utility to all holders &#8211; which is something that most projects have failed to deliver.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cockynft.io/?utm_source=CryptoNews&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=Cocky"><u>VISIT COCKY TODAY</u></a><br>&nbsp;</p>

Ripple (XRP) tanked 8.33% on Tuesday prior to FOMC, followed by Ethereum (ETH) with a nearly 4% decline. In the same session, other crypto majors Bitcoin (BTC) and Cardano (ADA), also showed weakness.</p><p>The XRP price has since bounced to $0.42 at press time but analysts caution investors to stay away from leading cryptocurrencies at this point. The market&#8217;s weakness is expected to linger in the long term, and the biggest recipients of this setback are Bitcoin (BTC) and leading altcoins.</p><p>Investors pocket their remaining holdings and put them in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thehideaways.io/?utm_source=cnews&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=xrpeth"><u>The Hideaways (HDWY)</u></a>. The token is projected to become one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies this year.</p><h2>Ripple (XRP) &#8216;s Fund Inflows Triple, But its Token Price Remains Weak</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The latest on-chain analysis shows Ripple&#8217;s increasing investment inflows despite the weakness in the broader crypto market.</p><p>$300,000 worth of funds is believed to have been put into XRP last week, growing threefold from the previous week&#8217;s $100,000 inflows.</p><p>This means interest in Ripple (XRP) remains strong especially now that its management has filed for an appeal to trash the US SEC&#8217;s claim to consider it a regular security asset.</p><p>However, XRP&#8217;s price does not seem happy about the update. The token is still trading lower than its May price range and is 80% down from its all time high, showing that trading XRP remains high risk.</p><p>The XRP price is forecasted to fall to a new low at $0.31. If selling pressure continues at this level, XRP might revisit $0.28 &#8211; a level not seen since June.</p><h2>All the Hype Gone After the Ethereum (ETH)&#8217;s Merge&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Ethereum (ETH) is another token that&#8217;s been leading the market losers lately. With the Ethereum Merge anticipation now gone, it&#8217;s time for a timely correction.</p><p>After the FOMC meeting, ETH crashed as low as $1,220. The token shed over 20% off its value last week and 14% in 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p>After falling from the critical support at $1,400, analysts&#8217; forecast on the coin turned sour. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-tweets-with-crypto-prices-crashing-fomc-day.htm">Experts predict</a> prices declining to the $1,000.00 zone as selling pressure continues despite today&#8217;s minor relief bounce.</p><p>Ethereum&#8217;s RSI had fallen to 35.0 from this month&#8217;s peak at 60.0. It is nearing the oversold danger zone, which, if hit, could pose a greater risk to the coin.</p><h2>Forget About Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) Invest In The Hideaways (HDWY)<br>&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The ongoing weakness of Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/luna-up-200-its-time-put-gains-hideaways-hdwy.htm">Terra (LUNA)</a> means one thing: it is time to explore new coins with colossal potential &#8211; and our analysts predict up to 10,000% potential here.&nbsp;</p><p>The real estate crypto project <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thehideaways.io/?utm_source=cnews&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=xrpeth"><u>The Hideaways (HDWY)</u></a> is changing the traditional real estate game with:&nbsp;</p><p>Ability to own a fraction of a property and avoid deposit, legal and financial fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Gain 2 sources of passive income through capital appreciation and rental monthly income.&nbsp;</p><p>Invest from anywhere in the world, regardless of nationality, you can buy a fraction of a property in any country The Hideaways invests in.&nbsp;</p><p>For as low as $100, investors can avail of its non-fungible tokens backed by real-world assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Its native token <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thehideaways.io/?utm_source=cnews&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=xrpeth"><u>HDWY</u></a> is selling at $0.02 &#8211; a 100% increase since first mentioned.
