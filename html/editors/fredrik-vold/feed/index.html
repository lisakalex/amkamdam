<p>The news that the necessary on-chain transactions to transfer the ownership had been completed was shared by Friend.tech on X this weekend, with the team saying the move will was necessary to improve security and compliance with tax rules.</p>
<p>“These changes will improve the long term security of friendtech and allow us to fulfill tax obligations,” the post said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Friend.tech’s move of funds to a more secure multisig custody solution followed an incident from October this year when a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/scammer-makes-off-around-400k-24-hours-by-targeting-friendtech-users-through-sim-swapping-scams.htm">scammer got away with around $400,000</a> in 24 hours by targeting Friend.tech users with so-called SIM-swapping attacks.</p>
<p>In a post on X at the time, blockchain sleuth ZachXBT revealed that the scammer had stolen 234 ETH over the past 24 hours by SIM-swapping four different Friend.tech users.</p>

<h2>Launched in August</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Friend.tech launched on the new Base blockchain as recently as in August this year, and has already accumulated revenues of more than $25 million, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/friend.tech">data</a> from DeFiLlama.</p>
<p>In terms of user fees, Friend.tech has now generated close to $52 million on a cumulative basis.</p>
<p>The fees are derived from taxing around 10% of the trading volume of social tokens.</p>

<p>The platform made headlines in October when data showed that the platform had <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/friendtech-developers-amass-nearly-20-million-since-august-debut.htm">generated revenues of over $20 million</a> after being live for just two months.</p>
<p>Friend.tech serves as a platform that enables users to link their X accounts and facilitates the buying and selling of influencer profile tokens, known as “keys,” using ETH on the Ethereum-based layer 2 network Base.</p>

<p>People will be surprised by the fast progress being made with crypto implementations at e-commerce platform Shopify, according to a senior executive at the company.</p>
<p>Writing on social media platform X on Sunday, Kaz Najatian, Vice President of Product and Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Shopify, described the crypto-related work being done internally at the company as “some of our best work right now.”</p>
<p>“In a couple of years people are going to be surprised how we move so fast, but that&#8217;s because of the work being done right now,” the Shopify executive wrote.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While specific details about the nature of Shopify&#8217;s crypto implementation were not provided in the post, the statement suggests a strategic commitment to leverage crypto and blockchain technology in one capacity or another within the platform&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>The ecommerce giant&#8217;s proactive approach aligns with the growing intersection of traditional commerce and the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.</p>
<h2>Shopify’s existing crypto implementations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shopify has worked on crypto payment solutions for some time already, with for instance <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana (SOL)</a> announcing in August this year that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-solana-pay-intergrates-with-shopify-online-marketplace-platform-can-sol-10x-from-here.htm">Solana Pay had been approved as an app integration on Shopify</a>.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the crypto exchange and payments provider Crypto.com launched its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-payments-on-shopify-cloudflare-plays-with-ethereum-ey-polygon-more-news.htm">Crypto.com Pay service to all merchants who use Shopify</a>, enabling them to accepts purchases made with crypto.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify is one of the largest e-commerce platform providers for online stores in the world.</p>
<p>In addition to e-commerce solutions, the company also offers point-of-sale solutions for physical retail locations.</p>
<p>As of the end of last year, Shopify reported that more than 2 million businesses in 175 countries used its platform.</p>

<p>While the broader crypto market appears to be moving toward a potential bull-market phase, the non-fungible token (NFT) sector, led by collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes, is experiencing a contrasting trend.</p>
<p>The Nansen NFT-500 index, which gauges the valuation of the top 500 NFTs, has seen a 50% decline year-to-date when measured in Ether (ETH) and a 16% drop in US dollar terms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Blue-Chip 10 index, an index focused on only the most popular NFT collections like CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), is down by 44% in ETH terms and 1.7% in USD.</p>
<h2>Negative correlation between NFT and ETH prices</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/30/nft-prices-are-still-lagging-behind-ethers-gains/">comments</a> given to CoinDesk on Thursday, Nick Ruck, chief operating officer of ContentFi, attributed the subdued NFT market performance to the negative correlation between NFT prices and the price of ETH.</p>
<p>He noted that NFTs have survived their initial market cycle but haven&#8217;t witnessed a new technological breakthrough or significant user interest, unlike popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the overall dip, there are signs of growth in the NFT market, particularly in NFTs based on utility in gaming rather than simple so-called JPEGs, and in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-ordinals-nft-collections.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals space</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin ordinals is not only a breakthrough for Bitcoin utility, but also a hub that brings communities together,&#8221; Ruck said, while noting that a number of entities from outside the crypto sector are currently exploring ways to get involved in the Ordinals craze.</p>
<p>“[…] everyone found a common ground and wants a piece of it,” he said.</p>

<p>The iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible token (NFT) collection has found a new home in the metaverse of Roblox, thanks to the metaverse-based &#8220;supergroup&#8221; Kingship.</p>
<p>Developed by Universal Music Group’s 10:22PM, the fictional band Kingship has expanded its presence from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spotifys-latest-experiment-playlists-unlocked-by-nft-holders-the-future-of-music-streaming.htm">token-enabled playlists on Spotify</a> to Roblox with the launch of the interactive game, &#8220;Kingship Islands,&#8221; a game where players find themselves in an island paradise after a crash landing and embark on a quest to unite the band members of Kingship.</p>
<p>The Kingship band features characters based on the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, as well as one character from the Mutant Ape collection.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Kingship Islands game allows players to earn certain in-game items for free in the initial six weeks after launch.</p>

<h2>A band of BAYC characters</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Initially conceptualized in 2021, Kingship operates as a metaverse band, with characters derived from Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT avatars.</p>
<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club creator, Yuga Labs, grants certain rights to NFT holders, enabling them to develop and sell derivative projects and products using the iconic artwork.</p>

<p>Andrea Enria, Chair of the supervisory board at the European Central Bank (ECB), has emphasized the need for rigorous regulation when crypto entities start resembling banks.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/interviews/date/2023/html/ssm.in231129~5d3abefe0c.en.html">interview</a> with Germany’s Handelsblatt, Enria pointed to the challenges in supervising crypto companies, noting that certain services in the sector closely mimic traditional bank services, especially in payments and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>The primary difficulty, according to Enria, is the issue of “deterritorialization,” where crypto entities often lack precise physical headquarters.</p>
<p>This challenge has famously been exemplified by Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, which operates around the world without having a specific global headquarters.</p>
<p>Binance last week entered into a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">$4.3 billion settlement</a> agreement with several US government agencies, and the exchange’s new CEO, Richard Teng, has vowed to make <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binances-new-ceo-teng-commits-to-more-regulatory-collaboration-is-this-a-new-chapter-for-binance.htm">regulatory compliance a key focus going forward</a>.</p>
<h2>Concerns about crypto’s decentralized nature</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In his interview, Enria expressed concerns about the lack of issuer clarity in major cryptos like Bitcoin and the absence of a defined entity in DeFi projects, making supervision challenging.</p>
<p>He pointed to what he called the “opacity” within crypto firms, citing the case of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm">FTX&#8217;s collapse in 2022</a> as revealing significant consolidation issues and a lack of a “group-wide perspective of the business and of the risks that these entities take.”</p>
<p>While discussing the ECB&#8217;s planned digital euro and private cryptocurrencies, Enria emphasized that these developments do not pose a threat to the role of traditional banks.</p>
<p>The European Union (EU) is currently considering proposals for a digital euro, and questions about the regulatory framework for virtual assets are also continuing to emerge.</p>
<p>However, Enria acknowledged the serious difficulties in regulating crypto entities that offer bank-like services due to their decentralized and often borderless nature.</p>
<p>“The issue will be to make sure that once somebody is conducting banking activity, it’s brought under the remit of banking regulation and supervision,” he said, while admitting that this will be a “challenge for us more than for the banks.”</p>

<p>The total value locked (TVL) on the newly launched Ethereum-based layer 2 network Blast has already closed in on Solana’s TVL after being live for just 10 days.</p>
<p>Judging from <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/blast">data</a> from Defi Llama, Blast currently boasts an impressive TVL of $621.6 million, just below the $651.5 million TVL that Solana has.</p>
<p>News of the impressive milestone was shared on social media platform X by crypto researcher Evan Van Ness, who pointed out how Blast’s TVL has grown to match that of “the most hyped VC chain in history” in such a short time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Blast founded by NFT creator</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For comparison, Solana is one of the most popular blockchains for smart contract development and DeFi applications in the crypto space, and the network has been around since Match 2020.</p>
<p>Blast, on the other hand, went live as recently as last week, and was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blur-founder-launches-new-layer-2-network-blast-raises-55-million-within-hours.htm">founded by Tieshun “Pacman” Roquerre</a>, who is also the founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur.</p>
<p>The new network made headlines shortly after its launch when an unidentified <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unidentified-whale-deposits-10000-eth-worth-20-million-in-new-blast-l2-project.htm">whale deposited a massive 10,000 ETH</a> to the network.</p>
<p>According to an X post from the team behind the network, the plan is for Blast to become the first Ethereum layer 2 platform to introduce a built-in yield model.</p>
<p>The project raised some $20 million in initial funding, and continued to see on-chain investments in excess of $55 million within hours of its launch.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Criticism from Paradigm</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite all the positive attention around Blast, the network has also received some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">scrutiny from the prominent venture capital firm Paradigm</a>, outlined numerous issues with the scaling solution.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Paradigm’s Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson highlighted that the decision to launch the bridge before the layer-2 network and the three-month withdrawal restriction set an unfavorable precedent for other projects.</p>
<p>Robinson in his post also criticized the marketing strategy that Blast has chosen, saying “much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are a lot of components of Blast that I’m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don’t agree with the decision to launch the…</p>

<p>Shares of the crypto exchange Coinbase with the ticker COIN are surging in the stock market, currently trading at $128.27, the highest level seen in 2023.</p>
<p>The current stock price surpasses the previous peak of $110.15 from July and aligns with price levels from May 2022 when spot Bitcoin last traded at levels above $30,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137708" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-137708" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701274206-coin-price.png" alt="COIN stock price chart" width="1500" height="472" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701274206-coin-price.png 1500w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701274206-coin-price-300x94.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701274206-coin-price-1024x322.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701274206-coin-price-768x242.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137708" class="wp-caption-text">COIN stock price.

<p>Although still below the all-time high of $342.98 in November 2021, Coinbase&#8217;s recent performance is noteworthy.</p>
<p>The surge follows comments by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong from earlier this week saying the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">settlement imposed on Binance</a> by the US Department of Justice marks a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-binance-settlement-marks-a-turning-point-for-crypto.htm">turning point for crypto</a>.</p>
<p>“The enforcement action against Binance, that’s allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history,” Armstrong said.</p>
<h2>New bullish phase for crypto?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, the rise in the stock price also comes amid a broader bullish trend for the crypto market.</p>
<p>In the past month, COIN, has outperformed major assets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-the-united-states.htm">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ethereum.htm">Ethereum</a>, gaining more than 70%.</p>
<p>Already, COIN’s outperformance of spot crypto prices has given Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest to rebalance the holdings for its exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on Bitcoin and crypto.</p>
<p>Ark recently sold $5.3 million worth of Coinbase shares while acquiring about $1.2 million in Robinhood shares.</p>
<p>Following the sale, Coinbase and Robinhood constitute 13% and 4%, respectively, of the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF portfolio.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Coinbase&#8217;s stock performance has often mirrored the overall volatility in the crypto market.</p>
<p>When crypto prices rise, COIN tends to benefit, and when prices decline, its shares follow suit, and investors are therefore paying close attention now that COIN appears to outperform the major crypto assets.Top of FormBottom of Form</p>

<p>“Anyone who ever sent from bybit to crimebase got that email. Probably the cftc fishing for burger users to establish jurisdiction,” one user <a href="https://twitter.com/napgener/status/1729300085182198247">said</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, however, multiple users who claimed to have never used Bybit or created accounts with the exchange have also received the subpoena notice emails from Coinbase, according to Decrypt’s sources.</p>
<p>Coinbase and the CFTC have still not commented publicly on the matter.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-binance-sued-by-cftc-over-offering-unregistered-crypto-derivate-trading-products-us.htm">CFTC has previously taken legal action against Binance</a> for various violations, including failure to implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and operating illegal digital assets derivatives exchanges.</p>
<p>In the recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">settlement between Binance and the US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ), Binance agreed to pay a $1.35 billion fine for violating CFTC guidelines.</p>
<p>Bybit began enforcing KYC standards across all of its services in May 2023.</p>
<p>As of now, no lawsuit has been filed against Bybit by the CFTC.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/coinbase-ceo-crypto-industry-can-turn-page-after-binance-settlement.html">interview</a> with CNBC, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has expressed optimism about the crypto industry&#8217;s future following the historic <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">$4 billion settlement imposed on Binance</a>.</p>
<p>In the interview, Armstrong said he believes the enforcement action against Binance by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) allows the crypto community to &#8220;turn the page&#8221; and move forward, potentially closing a chapter of the crypto industry&#8217;s history marred by controversies.</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of regulatory clarity, saying that a clearer regulatory environment would attract more investment, especially from institutional and high-net worth players.</p>
<p>The DOJ settlement with Binance included a $4 billion fine and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">resignation of Binance&#8217;s founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao</a>, who pleaded guilty to money laundering violations and other charges.</p>
<p>The US government accused Binance of violating the US Bank Secrecy Act and breaching sanctions on Iran.</p>
<h2>Cash more popular than crypto among criminals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Addressing concerns about illicit activities in the crypto space, Armstrong pushed back on the narrative that crypto is mainly used for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>He noted that, based on Coinbase&#8217;s observations, illicit activities in the crypto industry are less than 1%, contrasting it with illicit uses of cash, which he said is higher.</p>
<h2>SEC lawsuit</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Like Binance, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-coinbase-sued-by-sec-just-day-after-binance-lawsuit-which-firm-next.htm">Coinbase has been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), the main regulatory body overseeing financial markets in the US.</p>
<p>“We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement when the lawsuit was announced in June this year.</p>
<p>Despite ongoing legal challenges, Armstrong in the interview expressed confidence in Coinbase&#8217;s ability to navigate the legal landscape, and denied claims that the lawsuit will force <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-pushes-toward-global-expansion-sets-sights-regulated-markets.htm">Coinbase to move its operations out of the US</a>.</p>

<p>TORN, the governance token of the Ethereum-based coin mixing protocol Tornado Cash, lost more than half of its value within just an hour on Monday after Binance said it would delist the token.</p>
<p>From trading at a price right around $4 at 6 am UTC time on Monday, TORN one hour later had collapsed to $1.95, a loss of around 52%.</p>
<p>Following the massive crash, the token briefly regained some if its losses, before sellers once again took control, sending it to lows of around $1.6, or almost 60% below the pre-announcement price.</p>

<p>“When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it,” the statement added.</p>

<h2>Binance to focus on regulatory compliance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Trading on Binance in the TORN/BUSD pair currently makes up more than 57% of the trading volume in TORN, and the delisting is therefore significant for the overall liquidity of the token.</p>
<p>At the same time, a review and delisting by a major exchange like Binance could very likely be followed by delistings from other exchanges, making the liquidity situation for TORN holders even worse.</p>
<p>The announcement from Binance came shortly after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">Richard Teng took over for Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO</a> of the exchange.</p>
<p>Among other things, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binances-new-ceo-teng-commits-to-more-regulatory-collaboration-is-this-a-new-chapter-for-binance.htm">Teng has vowed to do more to make Binance compliant</a> with regulations around the world.</p>
<h2>Controversial mixing service</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tornado Cash is a so-called coin mixing service that is used to obfuscate who the sender and receiver of an Ethereum transaction is.</p>
<p>The protocol has received its fair share of negative news coverage due to its popularity among hackers and cybercriminals.</p>
<p>In August of 2022, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-significant-legal-action-against-crypto-in-us-hodlnaut-halts-withdrawals-zipmex-releases-ethereum-bitcoin-more-news.htm">US Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash</a>, saying the mixing service “has repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors.”</p>
<p>In November the same year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-treasury-redesignates-sanctions-tornado-cash-crypto-mixer-citing-north-korea-involvement.htm">the department redesignated the sanctions</a>, saying North Korea’s Lazarus Group has used the service to launder more than $100 million in stolen funds.</p>

<p>As the crypto industry continues to evolve, a new wave of scams is emerging, blending the hype of artificial intelligence (AI) with crypto, Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tezos/">Tezos</a> blockchain, has warned.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/11/26/beware-of-crypto-grifters-looking-to-crash-the-ai-party/">commentary</a> piece for Fortune on Sunday, warned of a rising trend where opportunistic individuals are attempting to fuse these seemingly unrelated fields to capitalize on unsuspecting investors.</p>
<h2>Three types of AI-related crypto scams</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Breitman, there are three distinct flavors to this emerging trend.</p>
<p>The first involves using crypto tokens for accessing AI models or services, attempting to exploit the overlap in the usage of the term &#8220;tokens&#8221; in both AI and crypto contexts.</p>
<p>While some AI services accept crypto for payments, the linkage is often superficial, and entrepreneurs may attempt to convince investors otherwise, she said.</p>
<p>The second flavor revisits the notion that &#8220;data is the new oil,&#8221; a phrase from the 2017 boom in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-are-the-risks-in-an-ico.htm">initial coin offerings (ICO)</a> that has now become an internet meme.</p>
<p>According to the Tezos co-founder, scammers may peddle tokens claiming to reward individuals for contributing personal data to AI training models through supposed &#8220;data marketplaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her article, Breitman dismissed this concept, saying that personal data is in “no sensible way” a monetizable asset.</p>
<p>Third, Breitman predicted the emergence of tokens explicitly branded with &#8220;AI&#8221; or &#8220;GPT&#8221; (based on the popular chat bot ChatGPT) in their names, capitalizing on the excitement surrounding these technologies.</p>
<h2>Crypto and AI merger make little sense</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In conclusion, Breitman stressed that the attempts that have been seen so far to merge AI and crypto make no sense in the eyes of genuine AI developers.</p>
<p>She also cautioned against falling for these &#8220;shoehorned&#8221; tokens, and said the crypto industry unfortunately has demonstrated a tendency to generate questionable business models with the hope of luring unsuspecting investors.</p>
<p>“This includes rebranding existing crypto businesses in hopes of dumping tokens on retail suckers,” she said, while reminding readers that the main value of crypto is to provide “a censorship resistant store of value that unites people across borders.”</p>

<p>Creditors of the crypto derivatives exchange CoinFLEX are alleging that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/three-arrows-capital-founders-face-dubai-regulators-scrutiny-over-new-unregulated-exchange-opnx.htm">newly established creditor claims marketplace OPNX</a>, founded by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/three-arrows-capital-liquidators-request-contempt-sanctions-for-co-founder-kyle-davies-whats-going-on.htm">bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital</a> (3AC) co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, wrongfully used CoinFLEX assets without their consent.</p>
<p>The accusations are detailed in a writ of summons filed in the High Court of Hong Kong and was first <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coin-flex-creditors-unsatisfied-with-restructuring-process-to-opnx">reported</a> on by Cointelegraph on Thursday.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, Liquidity Technologies and Liquidity Technologies Software, entities associated with CoinFLEX&#8217;s original operations, claim that OPNX co-founder and former <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/creditors-of-struggling-crypto-exchange-coinflex-sue-ceo-and-seek-funds-from-bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver.htm">CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb misappropriated assets</a>, intellectual properties, and trade secrets of CoinFLEX during his tenure.</p>
<p>The filing alleged that Lamb diverted clients and business opportunities to OPNX, solicited employees and contractors, and engaged in actions detrimental to CoinFLEX creditors.</p>
<p>Critics argue that Lamb&#8217;s actions have included forging a fake non-disclosure agreement and falsely representing OPNX&#8217;s association with CoinFLEX creditors.</p>
<p>The accusations also highlight Lamb&#8217;s simultaneous involvement in setting up OPNX while serving as CoinFLEX&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>The legal action is a response to dissatisfaction with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-crypto-exchanges-trouble-nuri-files-for-insolvency-while-coinflex-files-for-restructuring.htm">restructuring of CoinFLEX</a>, which halted withdrawals, leading creditors to form an ad hoc committee for deliberations.</p>
<p>After the restructuring&#8217;s approval on March 7, creditors claim to have discovered Lamb&#8217;s actions against their interests, leading to the filing of the writ of summons.</p>
<p>The allegations have not been proven in the High Court of Hong Kong, and the legal proceedings add another layer of complexity to the ongoing drama.</p>
<p>OPNX, responding to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/su-zhu-of-three-arrows-capital-gets-restraining-order-against-billionaire-arthur-hayes-amid-dispute.htm">criticism from figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes</a>, asserts that its model benefits creditors by allowing them to sell claims on the exchange.</p>

<p>The idea of a Bitcoin supercycle, first introduced by Bitcoin educator Dan Held in 2020, is once again gaining traction in the community as Bitcoin is entering what some believe could be another long-term bullish phase.</p>
<p>The key driver behind this potential supercycle is a combination of factors, including Bitcoin&#8217;s programmed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-market-cycles-explained.htm">halving cycle every four years</a>, increased institutional adoption, and the expansion of use cases such as the Lightning Network and potentially Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-nfts-how-ordinals-proved-bitcoin-can-evolve-with-times.htm">Ordinals</a>.</p>
<p>It is believed that once these factors fully play out, Bitcoin – and perhaps crypto more broadly – will no longer be subject to the traditional boom-and-bust pattern observed in previous market cycles.</p>
<p>Despite these elements already being present to some extent, however, the previous cycle did not prevent another sharp market downturn that began at the end of 2021.</p>
<h2>Landscape shifting to favor a supercycle</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, the landscape may now be shifting, particularly in the United States, which constitutes a significant portion of global equity markets, crypto news outlet Cointelegraph speculated in an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-supercycle-2024-investment-trading">article</a> from Thursday.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/galaxy-digital-projects-bitcoin-price-reach-near-60000-year-after-spot-etf-approval.htm">potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> in the US, exemplified by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-community-divided-over-blackrocks-recent-bitcoin-etf-application.htm">BlackRock&#8217;s application</a> in June 2023, could provide the necessary institutional support that a Bitcoin supercycle would need.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/fitch-downgrades-us-governments-debt-rating-does-this-boost-cryptos-use-case.htm">downgrades in the US credit rating</a> by major agencies like Standard and Poor&#8217;s, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings also raise questions about the stability of the US dollar.</p>
<p>If hyperinflation becomes a concern, Bitcoin could emerge as a safe haven, mirroring trends observed in other countries facing economic uncertainties, the Cointelegraph report noted.</p>
<p>The ongoing trend of dedollarization and potential loss of confidence in fiat currencies more broadly may drive increased adoption, especially in countries facing economic challenges.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-halts-btc-sales-remain-bullish-price-ahead-of-halving.htm">upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024</a>, combined with potential institutional support and changing global economic dynamics, creates a landscape where the Bitcoin supercycle could materialize.</p>
<p>As the crypto community eagerly awaits developments in the coming years, the discussion around a potential Bitcoin supercycle continues to shape the narrative of the industry, with stakeholders closely monitoring key indicators and events that could propel Bitcoin into uncharted territory.</p>

<p>Blast, a newly launched Ethereum-based layer 2 network, is already gaining traction in the market after one unidentified whale deposited a massive 10,000 ETH to the network.</p>
<p>The deposit was made on Wednesday this week, just two days after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blur-founder-launches-new-layer-2-network-blast-raises-55-million-within-hours.htm">Blast went live in “early access” mode</a>.</p>
<p>Worth over $20 million in fiat terms by today’s price, the news of the massive on-chain transaction was shared on social media platform X by the popular community member Farokh.</p>
<p>“Some degen deposited 10,000 ETH into BLAST,” Farokh wrote, seemingly shocked that someone would deposit such a large amount on a newly launched blockchain project.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some degen deposited 10,000 ETH into BLAST. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f633.png" alt="😳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/GODo20RDTp">pic.twitter.com/GODo20RDTp</a></p>

<h2>Blast went live this week</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Blast was launched by Tieshun “Pacman” Roquerre, who is also the founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur, on Monday this week.</p>
<p>According to an X post from the team behind the network, the plan is for Blast to become the first Ethereum layer 2 platform to introduce a built-in yield model.</p>
<p>The project raised some $20 million in initial funding, and continued to see on-chain investments in excess of $55 million within hours of its launch.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins.</p>
<p>We’ve raised $20m from <a href="https://twitter.com/paradigm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Paradigm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/standardcrypto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StandardCrypto</a> to build the L2 that helps you earn more.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ethereum-based layer 2 networks like Blast have become more popular in recent years, partly thanks to increased transaction fees and slower transactions speeds on Ethereum’s base layer.</p>
<p>According to a report from blockchain intelligence firm Messari from last month, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/layer-2-networks-account-for-nearly-two-thirds-of-ethereum-transactions-report.htm">layer 2 networks now account for nearly two-thirds of all Ethereum transactions</a>.</p>
<p>According to Kunal Goel, a research analyst at Messari, the increased adoption of layer 2 networks in the third quarter of this year is largely a result of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/base-network-outstrips-solanas-tvl-as-summer-lull-draws-close.htm">growing adoption of Coinbase’s layer 2 network Base</a>.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Base in August, it has lived up to its expectations with growing transactions and use cases and temporarily recording more activity than Ethereum’s main network at one point.</p>

<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has added fuel to the frenzy surrounding the Solana-based meme coin BONK by <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-futures-will-launch-usd%E2%93%A2-m-1000bonk-and-pyth-perpetual-contracts-with-up-to-50x-leverage-7b3f500e0eec40f380023b4ff0ccca18">announcing</a> the launch of a BONK futures offering.</p>
<p>The listing comes as BONK has seen a dramatic surge in the market, rising more than 50% in the past 7 days alone, per data from CoinGecko.</p>
<p>The token has been making new all-time highs on a daily basis as of late, after breaking through its previous all-time high from January this year earlier this week.</p>
<p>As of press time on Thursday, BONK had a market capitalization of just over $270 million, ranking it as 158<sup>th</sup> most valuable cryptoasset by market cap, per CoinGecko’s ranking.</p>
<figure id="attachment_135842" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135842" style="width: 1524px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-135842" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700747476-bonk-price.png" alt="BONK price chart" width="1524" height="1150" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700747476-bonk-price.png 1524w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700747476-bonk-price-300x226.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700747476-bonk-price-1024x773.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700747476-bonk-price-768x580.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1524px) 100vw, 1524px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-135842" class="wp-caption-text">BONK price since inception. Source: CoinGecko</figcaption></figure>
<p>The new listing on Binance Futures is for USDⓈ-M 1000BONK, a USD-margined and settled contract with leverage up to 50x.</p>
<p>The surge in BONK&#8217;s popularity is seen by some as riding the coattails of Solana&#8217;s recent success, marked by a surge in the price of the network’s native token SOL.</p>
<p>While SOL has experienced an impressive 80% gain over the last 30 days, BONK easily outshone its counterpart with a huge gain of roughly 1,200% over the same time period.</p>
<h2>PYTH listing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Besides BONK, Binance on Wednesday also announced the listing of a perpetual futures contract for PYTH, another hot Solana-based token.</p>
<p>The new listings are scheduled to go live on November 22, 2023, at 14:00 (UTC) and 14:30 (UTC), respectively.</p>
<h2>First listings by new Binance CEO</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The addition of BONK and PYTH to Binance&#8217;s platform is particularly noteworthy in light of recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">challenges faced by the exchange</a>, including the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">departure of high-profile founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ)</a>, as well as significant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-sees-more-than-900-million-in-outflows-as-former-ceo-pleads-guilty.htm">outflows that on Wednesday reached $900 million</a> in 24 hours.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the new listings are part of a marketing strategy orchestrated by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-says-exchange-has-robust-revenues-and-profits-hinting-at-ability-to-pay-4-3b-fines.htm">new Binance CEO, Richard Teng</a>.</p>

<figure id="attachment_135217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135217" style="width: 1388px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-135217" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663022-czusd.png" alt="CZ/USD price" width="1388" height="886" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663022-czusd.png 1388w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663022-czusd-300x191.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663022-czusd-1024x654.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663022-czusd-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1388px) 100vw, 1388px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-135217" class="wp-caption-text">CZ/USD price.

<p>It’s important to note that the token has no affiliation with Binance or CZ, and that it was created by an anonymous developer who seized the opportunity to capitalize on the situation.</p>
<h2>$3.7 million market cap</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After having been live for close to 24 hours, the CZ token already holds a market capitalization of $3.7 million, a figure that has trended rapidly higher during the short period since its launch.</p>

<h2>TENG token goes live</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, another token associated with the unfolding drama has also entered the scene: TENG.</p>
<p>Named after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-says-exchange-has-robust-revenues-and-profits-hinting-at-ability-to-pay-4-3b-fines.htm">Richard Teng, CZ’s successor as CEO of Binance</a>, the TENG token has seen a more modest 10,000% gain since being introduced to the market on Tuesday.</p>
<figure id="attachment_135219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135219" style="width: 1450px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-135219" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663100-tengusd.png" alt="TENG/USD price" width="1450" height="884" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663100-tengusd.png 1450w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663100-tengusd-300x183.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663100-tengusd-1024x624.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700663100-tengusd-768x468.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1450px) 100vw, 1450px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-135219" class="wp-caption-text">TENG/USD price. Source: CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the CZ token, the TENG token has no affiliation with Richard Teng or Binance, and could very well be a rug pull waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">Binance’s massive $4.3 billion fine</a> and founder and CEO <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao’s decision on Tuesday to step down</a> from the company, industry leaders have been reassuring the community that crypto is here to stay, and that it’s likely to come out even stronger.</p>
<p>Among those who have shared their thoughts on the dramatic events is Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, who said on social media platform X that he sees Binance&#8217;s settlement as a catalyst for proactive regulation and clear laws governing crypto.</p>
<p>Grewal pointed to the resilience of the crypto market, saying &#8220;crypto isn&#8217;t going anywhere,&#8221; and instead stressed the need for sensible regulation to ensure secure domestic crypto services will still exist in the future for American consumers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m watching the <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@binance</a> news, too. While we wait for a DOJ announcement, a reminder: crypto isn’t going anywhere. But to create a thriving cryptoeconomy in the US, we need clear, sensible regulation so American consumers have access to secure domestic crypto services. 1/4</p>
<p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1727043555678691482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed the sentiment, saying on the same platform that Coinbase will continue to operate as a crypto exchange in the US.</p>
<p>He added that the news is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-sees-binance-settlement-as-chance-for-industry-renewal.htm">a chance to turn a new chapter for the industry</a>, and, like Grewal, emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time. We got the licenses, hired the compliance and legal teams, and made it clear our brand was about trust…</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Armstrong <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="🛡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1727054176763756826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite the optimistic tone set by the Coinbase executives, some also used the occasion to criticize the crypto industry:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow, I mean, if you had told me 3 years ago that:</p>
<p>FTX<br />Binance <br />BlockFi<br />Terra<br />Celsius Network<br />Voyager Digital<br />Three Arrows Capital<br />Gemini Trust<br />Hodlnaut </p>
<p>And hundreds of other companies were all run by frauds</p>
<p>I would have absolutely believed you</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite varying opinions, many crypto enthusiasts believe that Binance&#8217;s shakeup will ultimately benefit the industry.</p>
<p>Ryan Selkis, founder and CEO of Messari Crypto, described Binance&#8217;s settlement as a &#8220;derisking&#8221; for the exchange, calling it “one of the biggest catalysts we could have in crypto.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Binance derisking is one of the biggest catalysts we could have in crypto.</p>
<p>+ Crypto is a &quot;real&quot; industry post $4 billion settlement<br />+ CZ takes a long-needed Miami vacation a la Arthur<br />+ Market rips higher, ETFs approved in Jan<br />+ GOP wins 2024 election, crypto laws passed</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Others offered more humorous takes, with for instance the well-known venture investor and podcast host Jason Calacanis making a joke about CZ’s tweet where he said he might “coach/mentor” startup entrepreneurs now that he is done as CEO of Binance.</p>
<p>“Crypto folks are built different,” Calacanis said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>In a move to enhance cross-border payments, Cambodia&#8217;s Bakong digital currency system, a component of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Chinese payment provider Alipay, Cambodia’s Phnom Penh Post recently <a href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/bakong-ink-cross-border-payment-mou">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Following the signing of the MoU, Cambodian vendors utilizing QR codes from the so-called KHQR network of the Bakong system can make payments to over 80 million Alipay merchants globally, contributing to the expansion of cross-border payments between Cambodia and China.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chinese visitors to Cambodia who use Alipay can shop in the country by scanning QR codes from the Bakong system at participating merchants.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Local vendors can now use the KHQR network of the Bakong system, a part of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), to make payments to over 80 million Alipay merchants globally.<a href="https://t.co/hLagrXU08X">https://t.co/hLagrXU08X</a></p>
<p>&mdash; The Phnom Penh Post (@phnompenhpost) <a href="https://twitter.com/phnompenhpost/status/1725492732653920499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The MoU, signed at the FinTech Expo in Singapore, aims to promote efficient and secure cross-border payment transactions via QR codes between the KHQR network and Alipay+.</p>
<p>The Bakong system is built on a blockchain, but is not a traditional central bank digital currency (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-yuan-enters-oil-market-as-petrochina-finalizes-first-international-crude-trade-cbdc.htm">CBDC</a>) given that the circulating tokens are a liability of commercial banks and not the central bank.</p>
<h2>Cambodia becoming more popular among Chinese tourists</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chea Serey, governor of the NBC, emphasized the significance of the collaboration, especially as Cambodia becomes increasingly popular among Chinese and international tourists.</p>
<p>The partnership facilitates payments in both the local currency, riel (KHR), and the US dollar (USD).</p>
<p>Douglas Feagin, senior vice president of Ant Group and head of Alipay+, expressed gratitude for the partnership, noting that it enhances the capability of Alipay partners to make payments across the KHQR network.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to the NBC for their partnership and support, which enables the acceptance of Alipay+ payment partners across the KHQR network. We believe this will offer added convenience to tourists, who prefer to ‘pay like a local’, using their familiar payment methods wherever possible,” he said.</p>
<p>Similarly, Khim Sambo Rothana, head of public relations and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) department at ABA Bank, welcomed the MoU as a positive step toward promoting the use of the Cambodian fiat currency.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 2023, Bakong recorded over 35.4 million transactions, amounting to more than $12 billion.</p>
<p>The amount constitutes approximately 67% of Cambodia&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>In addition to Cambodia, Bakong is already in use in Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia.</p>

<p>Originating during the so-called “DeFi Summer” of 2020 as a community of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm">yield farmers</a>, De.Fi has now evolved, resolving multiple industry challenges and expanding its user base over 100 times in the past three years, according to Michael Rosmer, the project’s co-founder.</p>
<p>De.Fi&#8217;s contributions include defusing over 540,000 risk tokens, potentially saving a staggering $27 billion by identifying scams based on smart code, sometimes before a scam project even goes live.</p>
<p>The project has been supported by HOF Capital, one of the early investors instrumental in the success of Tesla and SpaceX, Rosmer said about his project’s backers in a video on the De.Fi <a href="https://de.fi/2.0">website</a>.</p>

<p>Santander Private Banking International is now allowing its high-net-worth clients with bank accounts in Switzerland to trade and hold <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-the-united-states.htm">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">Ether (ETH)</a>.</p>
<p>A part of the Spanish banking giant Banco Santander, Santander Private Banking International plans to expand its crypto offerings in the coming months by introducing additional digital assets that align with its screening criteria, a CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/11/20/santander-private-bank-introduces-bitcoin-ethereum-trading-for-swiss-clients/">report</a> from Monday said, citing an internal announcement.</p>
<p>The report noted that the service is available to all private banking clients with accounts in Switzerland, regardless of whether the client resides in Switzerland or not.</p>
<p>Santander reportedly emphasized in the internal note that the crypto trading service is exclusively provided upon client request through their relationship managers.</p>
<p>The note also said that digital assets bought by clients will be held by a regulated custodian that stores the private keys to the assets.</p>
<p>The wording indicates that self-custody of crypto will not be supported by Santander for the time being.</p>
<p>Still, the move sets Santander apart from many other major banks, as it offers access to digital assets on open and permissionless blockchains, as opposed to closed and permissioned <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-expects-jpm-coin-to-hit-10-billion-in-daily-transactions.htm">blockchains that are being developed by banks like JPMorgan</a>.</p>
<h2>Clients expected to embrace custodial model</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a comment to CoinDesk, John Whelan, Santander’s head of crypto and digital assets, praised the regulatory framework for crypto in Switzerland, and said he expects clients to embrace the custodial model for their crypto holdings.</p>
<p>“As holding of crypto as an alternative asset class continues to expand, we expect that our clients prefer to rely on their existing financial institutions to be responsible for their assets,” Whelan said.</p>
<p>Santander Private Banking International serves around 210,000 wealthy clients, managing assets and deposits totaling approximately $315 billion.</p>
<p>The bank has not yet commented publicly on its move to offer crypto to private banking clients.</p>
