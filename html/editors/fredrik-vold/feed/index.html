<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a>-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Jito has launched its much-anticipated airdrop, distributing approximately $225 million worth of tokens to Solana users globally.</p>
<p>The airdrop, which commenced on Thursday this week at 11 am EST (4 pm UTC), introduced the Jito (JTO) token at a starting price of $6.01, as reported by CoinGecko.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This initial valuation positioned the 90 million tokens designated for the airdrop at an impressive market capitalization of more than half a billion dollars.</p>
<p>However, shortly after the launch, CoinGecko recorded a sharp drop in the token&#8217;s value that sent it tumbling to less than $2.</p>
<p>At the time of writing on Friday, JTO had stabilized right below the $3 mark, trading at $2.91, per CoinGecko‚Äôs data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_140484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140484" style="width: 2036px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-140484" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702041784-jto-price.png" alt="JTO price chart" width="2036" height="1160" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702041784-jto-price.png 2036w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702041784-jto-price-300x171.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702041784-jto-price-1024x583.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702041784-jto-price-768x438.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702041784-jto-price-1536x875.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702041784-jto-price-150x85.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2036px) 100vw, 2036px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140484" class="wp-caption-text">JTO price since launch. Source: CoinGecko</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the price fluctuations, the airdrop represents a significant benefit for Solana DeFi users.</p>
<p>So far, more than 63 million JTO tokens have already been claimed, with 27 million tokens remaining out of the 90 million that were made available, according to <a href="https://solscan.io/account/8Xm3tkQH581s3MoRHWUNYA5jKbgPATW4tJAAxgwDC6T6">SolScan</a>.</p>
<p>Eligible recipients for the airdrop include JitoSOL holders, Solana validators utilizing Jito MEV clients, and users of Jito‚Äôs MEV services.</p>
<p>Jito plans to conduct additional token airdrops in the future, in accordance with its roadmap.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>DDoS attack</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Jito was able to launch its token airdrop, the event did see some technical difficulties along the way.</p>
<p>Judging from reports from community members on X, Jito&#8217;s website suffered from a so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, a scenario in which malicious actors overload the site with traffic to disrupt its functionality.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While the motive behind the attack remains unclear, similar incidents have been reported across various crypto projects in the past, often involving scammers attempting to ransom the affected projects for the restoration of their website&#8217;s functionality.</p>
<h2>Token plans announced in November</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The airdrop comes after the Jito Foundation on November 27 first disclosed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jito-foundation-launches-jto-token-to-manage-solana-based-liquid-staking-protocol.htm">plans to create 1 billion JTO tokens</a> to facilitate the governance of its Jito Network. The Foundation said that this would include tasks such as establishing fees for the JitoSOL staking pool, overseeing revenue, and managing the DAO treasury.</p>
<p>According to the initial announcement, 115 million JTO tokens will be in circulation.</p>
<p>The allocation plan designates 34% of the tokens for community growth, 25% for ecosystem development, 24.5% for core contributors, and 16% for investors.</p>

<p>Anatoly Legkodymov, also known as ‚ÄúGandalf‚Äù and ‚ÄúTolik,‚Äù a Russian national and co-founder of the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Bitzlato, has pleaded guilty in a US federal court in New York to charges related to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.</p>
<p>Legkodymov admitted to overseeing Bitzlato Ltd., a crypto exchange that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-arrests-russian-co-founder-of-bitzlato-exchange-on-suspicion-of-money-laundering-illegal-gambling-and-drug-money.htm">served as a conduit for dark market transactions</a> and a haven for ransomware criminals, the US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Eastern District of New York said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/founder-and-majority-owner-cryptocurrency-exchange-pleads-guilty-unlicensed-money">press release</a> from Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúThe defendant may have thought he was operating from a safe haven overseas for his ‚ÄòNo Questions Asked‚Äô clearinghouse, but this prosecution and conviction demonstrate otherwise.‚Äù &#8211; U.S. Attorney Peace</p>
<p>&mdash; US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/EDNYnews/status/1732509399652946027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to the prosecutor, Bitzlato&#8217;s lax controls over illicit money transactions attracted criminal elements seeking to exploit its lenient procedures.</p>
<p>Legkodymov agreed to dissolve Bitzlato as part of his plea agreement, releasing any claim to approximately $23 million in seized assets.</p>
<p>The guilty plea was made before US District Judge Eric N. Vitaliano.</p>
<h2>Bitzlato‚Äôs limited KYC controls</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The charges highlight Bitzlato&#8217;s role in facilitating illegal activities, with the exchange marketing itself as a haven requiring minimal user identification.</p>
<p>Bitzlato allegedly became a hub for criminal proceeds, particularly in dealings with Hydra Market, the largest and longest-running darknet market for narcotics and illicit services.</p>
<p>The US Attorney‚Äôs Office further said that Legkodymov‚Äôs deficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures allowed users to submit information belonging to &#8220;straw man&#8221; registrants openly.</p>
<h2>Darknet marketplace Hydra Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Wednesday‚Äôs announcement, users of Hydra Market, a Russian online marketplace for illegal goods, exchanged over $700 million worth of crypto with Bitzlato until the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-hits-russian-crypto-exchange-with-sanctions-russian-central-bank-affraid-that-crypto-will-replace-ruble.htm">darknet market&#8217;s shutdown in April 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has previously claimed that Hydra back in 2021 accounted for as much as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-dark-web-crackdown-288-arrested-drugs-guns-crypto-seized.htm">80% of global darknet market-related crypto transactions</a>.</p>
<p>In a comment, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said that the DOJ, together with its partners, is ‚Äúdismantling and disrupting the cryptocrime ecosystem using all tools available.‚Äù</p>
<p>The guilty plea follows the earlier takedown of Bitzlato‚Äôs infrastructure and the seizure of its digital assets in January.</p>
<p>Legkodymov, a 40-year-old Russian national who resides in Shenzhen, China, was arrested in Miami in January this year.</p>
<p>The investigation was a joint effort by the US Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Eastern District of New York and the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET).</p>

<p>The Solana-based meme coin BONK is continuing to surge in the market, hitting an all-time high with a market capitalization close to $420 million on Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the token had risen more than 21% just in the last 24 hours at the time of writing, trading at a price of $ 0.00000676 and with a market cap right around the $400 million mark.</p>
<p>Over the past seven days, the hot meme coin is now up some 61%, and up more than 730% on a 30-day basis.</p>
<p>That compares to a 7-day gain of 12% for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> and a 14% gain for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/shib-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a>, the two most popular meme coins in the crypto market.</p>

<p>BONK, also a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/other-dog-and-cat-themed-coins-pump-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-keep-fighting.htm">dog-themed token</a>, is one of the most popular meme coin projects on the Solana blockchain at the moment.</p>
<p>On its website, the project describes itself as ‚Äúthe true community coin of web3,‚Äù and claims to have 649,000 holders across 10 different blockchains.</p>

<p>The BONK token launched all the way back in December of last year, but its popularity only started to take off last month.</p>
<p>The surge in the token price has followed a rising interest in the broader Solana ecosystem, which has also fueled a strong <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-becomes-5th-most-traded-crypto-in-the-world-adoption-rising.htm">rally in the price of Solana‚Äôs native SOL token</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SOL was up 8.2% for the past seven days and 48% for the past 30 days.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">$4.3 billion settlement</a> between Binance and various US government agencies, announced by top Biden administration officials, has stirred controversy due to the absence of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler at the announcement.</p>
<p>While Attorney General Merrick Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen were present, Gensler&#8217;s absence raised eyebrows, especially considering the SEC&#8217;s ongoing legal dispute with Binance, the influential business news outlet Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/binance-copped-a-4-billion-plea-but-is-still-fighting-the-sec-44a4e5a5">reported</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>Citing insiders ‚Äúfamiliar with the matter,‚Äù the report revealed that the SEC was not part of the extensive settlement talks that led to Binance and its founder, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Changpeng Zhao (CZ), pleading guilty</a> and resolving civil charges with the US Treasury Department.</p>
<p>The absence of the SEC indicates the challenges and high stakes involved in settling with a regulatory body that, although lacking the authority to imprison individuals, holds significant power to disrupt and potentially shut down US companies that operates in the crypto space.</p>
<h2>Futile attempts at reaching settlement with SEC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Before the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm">SEC filed its lawsuit against Binance</a> in June, attempts to reach a settlement were reportedly futile, as the parties couldn&#8217;t agree on terms.</p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs sources, a settlement on the SEC&#8217;s terms could have compelled Binance to shutter much of its US crypto trading operations and accept claims that its ‚Äúaffiliates engaged in manipulative trading.‚Äù</p>
<p>The report also said that various government agencies before filing the lawsuit against Binance tried to get the company to accept an injunction, a deal that would reportedly prevent Binance‚Äôs US arm from offering trading in many of the tokens it had listed at the time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat would sort of be the end of Binance.US,‚Äù Lee Reiners, an economics lecturer at Duke University, told the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Now, however, Binance appears to remain steadfast in defending its case against the SEC, saying in a comment ‚ÄúWe remain confident in our case against the SEC and will continue to defend our platform vigorously.‚Äù</p>

<p>Friend.tech‚Äôs move of funds to a more secure multisig custody solution followed an incident from October this year when a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/scammer-makes-off-around-400k-24-hours-by-targeting-friendtech-users-through-sim-swapping-scams.htm">scammer got away with around $400,000</a> in 24 hours by targeting Friend.tech users with so-called SIM-swapping attacks.</p>

<p>While specific details about the nature of Shopify&#8217;s crypto implementation were not provided in the post, the statement suggests a strategic commitment to leverage crypto and blockchain technology in one capacity or another within the platform&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>The ecommerce giant&#8217;s proactive approach aligns with the growing intersection of traditional commerce and the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.</p>
<h2>Shopify‚Äôs existing crypto implementations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shopify has worked on crypto payment solutions for some time already, with for instance <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana (SOL)</a> announcing in August this year that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-solana-pay-intergrates-with-shopify-online-marketplace-platform-can-sol-10x-from-here.htm">Solana Pay had been approved as an app integration on Shopify</a>.</p>

<p>Headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify is one of the largest e-commerce platform providers for online stores in the world.</p>
<p>In addition to e-commerce solutions, the company also offers point-of-sale solutions for physical retail locations.</p>
<p>As of the end of last year, Shopify reported that more than 2 million businesses in 175 countries used its platform.</p>

<p>While the broader crypto market appears to be moving toward a potential bull-market phase, the non-fungible token (NFT) sector, led by collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes, is experiencing a contrasting trend.</p>
<p>The Nansen NFT-500 index, which gauges the valuation of the top 500 NFTs, has seen a 50% decline year-to-date when measured in Ether (ETH) and a 16% drop in US dollar terms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Blue-Chip 10 index, an index focused on only the most popular NFT collections like CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), is down by 44% in ETH terms and 1.7% in USD.</p>
<h2>Negative correlation between NFT and ETH prices</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/30/nft-prices-are-still-lagging-behind-ethers-gains/">comments</a> given to CoinDesk on Thursday, Nick Ruck, chief operating officer of ContentFi, attributed the subdued NFT market performance to the negative correlation between NFT prices and the price of ETH.</p>
<p>He noted that NFTs have survived their initial market cycle but haven&#8217;t witnessed a new technological breakthrough or significant user interest, unlike popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the overall dip, there are signs of growth in the NFT market, particularly in NFTs based on utility in gaming rather than simple so-called JPEGs, and in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-ordinals-nft-collections.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals space</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin ordinals is not only a breakthrough for Bitcoin utility, but also a hub that brings communities together,&#8221; Ruck said, while noting that a number of entities from outside the crypto sector are currently exploring ways to get involved in the Ordinals craze.</p>
<p>‚Äú[‚Ä¶] everyone found a common ground and wants a piece of it,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>The iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible token (NFT) collection has found a new home in the metaverse of Roblox, thanks to the metaverse-based &#8220;supergroup&#8221; Kingship.</p>
<p>Developed by Universal Music Group‚Äôs 10:22PM, the fictional band Kingship has expanded its presence from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spotifys-latest-experiment-playlists-unlocked-by-nft-holders-the-future-of-music-streaming.htm">token-enabled playlists on Spotify</a> to Roblox with the launch of the interactive game, &#8220;Kingship Islands,&#8221; a game where players find themselves in an island paradise after a crash landing and embark on a quest to unite the band members of Kingship.</p>
<p>The Kingship band features characters based on the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, as well as one character from the Mutant Ape collection.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Kingship Islands game allows players to earn certain in-game items for free in the initial six weeks after launch.</p>

<h2>A band of BAYC characters</h2>

Initially conceptualized in 2021, Kingship operates as a metaverse band, with characters derived from Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT avatars.</p>
<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club creator, Yuga Labs, grants certain rights to NFT holders, enabling them to develop and sell derivative projects and products using the iconic artwork.</p>
<p>Launched in April of 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club is known as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/goblins-flip-bored-apes-in-24-hours-to-become-the-top-collection.htm">most popular NFT collections</a> of all time.</p>

<p>Andrea Enria, Chair of the supervisory board at the European Central Bank (ECB), has emphasized the need for rigorous regulation when crypto entities start resembling banks.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/interviews/date/2023/html/ssm.in231129~5d3abefe0c.en.html">interview</a> with Germany‚Äôs Handelsblatt, Enria pointed to the challenges in supervising crypto companies, noting that certain services in the sector closely mimic traditional bank services, especially in payments and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>The primary difficulty, according to Enria, is the issue of ‚Äúdeterritorialization,‚Äù where crypto entities often lack precise physical headquarters.</p>
<p>This challenge has famously been exemplified by Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, which operates around the world without having a specific global headquarters.</p>
<p>Binance last week entered into a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">$4.3 billion settlement</a> agreement with several US government agencies, and the exchange‚Äôs new CEO, Richard Teng, has vowed to make <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binances-new-ceo-teng-commits-to-more-regulatory-collaboration-is-this-a-new-chapter-for-binance.htm">regulatory compliance a key focus going forward</a>.</p>
<h2>Concerns about crypto‚Äôs decentralized nature</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In his interview, Enria expressed concerns about the lack of issuer clarity in major cryptos like Bitcoin and the absence of a defined entity in DeFi projects, making supervision challenging.</p>
<p>He pointed to what he called the ‚Äúopacity‚Äù within crypto firms, citing the case of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm">FTX&#8217;s collapse in 2022</a> as revealing significant consolidation issues and a lack of a ‚Äúgroup-wide perspective of the business and of the risks that these entities take.‚Äù</p>
<p>While discussing the ECB&#8217;s planned digital euro and private cryptocurrencies, Enria emphasized that these developments do not pose a threat to the role of traditional banks.</p>
<p>The European Union (EU) is currently considering proposals for a digital euro, and questions about the regulatory framework for virtual assets are also continuing to emerge.</p>
<p>However, Enria acknowledged the serious difficulties in regulating crypto entities that offer bank-like services due to their decentralized and often borderless nature.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe issue will be to make sure that once somebody is conducting banking activity, it‚Äôs brought under the remit of banking regulation and supervision,‚Äù he said, while admitting that this will be a ‚Äúchallenge for us more than for the banks.‚Äù</p>

<h2>Blast founded by NFT creator</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For comparison, Solana is one of the most popular blockchains for smart contract development and DeFi applications in the crypto space, and the network has been around since Match 2020.</p>
<p>Blast, on the other hand, went live as recently as last week, and was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blur-founder-launches-new-layer-2-network-blast-raises-55-million-within-hours.htm">founded by Tieshun ‚ÄúPacman‚Äù Roquerre</a>, who is also the founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur.</p>
<p>The new network made headlines shortly after its launch when an unidentified <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unidentified-whale-deposits-10000-eth-worth-20-million-in-new-blast-l2-project.htm">whale deposited a massive 10,000 ETH</a> to the network.</p>
<p>According to an X post from the team behind the network, the plan is for Blast to become the first Ethereum layer 2 platform to introduce a built-in yield model.</p>
<p>The project raised some $20 million in initial funding, and continued to see on-chain investments in excess of $55 million within hours of its launch.</p>

<h2>Criticism from Paradigm</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite all the positive attention around Blast, the network has also received some <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">scrutiny from the prominent venture capital firm Paradigm</a>, outlined numerous issues with the scaling solution.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Paradigm‚Äôs Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson highlighted that the decision to launch the bridge before the layer-2 network and the three-month withdrawal restriction set an unfavorable precedent for other projects.</p>
<p>Robinson in his post also criticized the marketing strategy that Blast has chosen, saying ‚Äúmuch of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are a lot of components of Blast that I‚Äôm excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on.

<p>Although still below the all-time high of $342.98 in November 2021, Coinbase&#8217;s recent performance is noteworthy.</p>
<p>The surge follows comments by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong from earlier this week saying the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">settlement imposed on Binance</a> by the US Department of Justice marks a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-binance-settlement-marks-a-turning-point-for-crypto.htm">turning point for crypto</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe enforcement action against Binance, that‚Äôs allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history,‚Äù Armstrong said.</p>
<h2>New bullish phase for crypto?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, the rise in the stock price also comes amid a broader bullish trend for the crypto market.</p>
<p>In the past month, COIN, has outperformed major assets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-the-united-states.htm">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-ethereum.htm">Ethereum</a>, gaining more than 70%.</p>
<p>Already, COIN‚Äôs outperformance of spot crypto prices has given Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest to rebalance the holdings for its exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on Bitcoin and crypto.</p>
<p>Ark recently sold $5.3 million worth of Coinbase shares while acquiring about $1.2 million in Robinhood shares.</p>
<p>Following the sale, Coinbase and Robinhood constitute 13% and 4%, respectively, of the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF portfolio.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Coinbase&#8217;s stock performance has often mirrored the overall volatility in the crypto market.</p>
<p>When crypto prices rise, COIN tends to benefit, and when prices decline, its shares follow suit, and investors are therefore paying close attention now that COIN appears to outperform the major crypto assets.Top of FormBottom of Form</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> users are reportedly receiving emails notifying them that their customer information might be shared with the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) following a subpoena served to Coinbase.</p>
<p>While the exchange has not publicly commented on the matter, the legal order appears to be related to an investigation involving <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bybit-review/">Bybit</a>, a Dubai-based crypto exchange founded by Ben Zhou.</p>
<p>Judging from screenshots of the email shared by Coinbase users on X, the exchange mentioned a possible protest against the subpoena in court before a November 30 deadline.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite this, a <a href="https://decrypt.co/207736/coinbase-might-forced-share-bitcoin-trading-data-cftc">report</a> from Decrypt citing unnamed sources have suggested that Coinbase is indeed working with the CFTC to determine the data to be shared, aiming to limit the scope as much as possible.</p>
<h2>More users targeted</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On X, some Coinbase users speculated about being targeted by the federal government, suggesting that only those using both Coinbase and Bybit might be affected.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnyone who ever sent from bybit to crimebase got that email. Probably the cftc fishing for burger users to establish jurisdiction,‚Äù one user <a href="https://twitter.com/napgener/status/1729300085182198247">said</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, however, multiple users who claimed to have never used Bybit or created accounts with the exchange have also received the subpoena notice emails from Coinbase, according to Decrypt‚Äôs sources.</p>
<p>Coinbase and the CFTC have still not commented publicly on the matter.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-binance-sued-by-cftc-over-offering-unregistered-crypto-derivate-trading-products-us.htm">CFTC has previously taken legal action against Binance</a> for various violations, including failure to implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and operating illegal digital assets derivatives exchanges.</p>
<p>In the recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">settlement between Binance and the US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ), Binance agreed to pay a $1.35 billion fine for violating CFTC guidelines.</p>
<p>Bybit began enforcing KYC standards across all of its services in May 2023.</p>
<p>As of now, no lawsuit has been filed against Bybit by the CFTC.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/coinbase-ceo-crypto-industry-can-turn-page-after-binance-settlement.html">interview</a> with CNBC, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has expressed optimism about the crypto industry&#8217;s future following the historic <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">$4 billion settlement imposed on Binance</a>.</p>
<p>In the interview, Armstrong said he believes the enforcement action against Binance by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) allows the crypto community to &#8220;turn the page&#8221; and move forward, potentially closing a chapter of the crypto industry&#8217;s history marred by controversies.</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of regulatory clarity, saying that a clearer regulatory environment would attract more investment, especially from institutional and high-net worth players.</p>
<p>The DOJ settlement with Binance included a $4 billion fine and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">resignation of Binance&#8217;s founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao</a>, who pleaded guilty to money laundering violations and other charges.</p>
<p>The US government accused Binance of violating the US Bank Secrecy Act and breaching sanctions on Iran.</p>
<h2>Cash more popular than crypto among criminals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Addressing concerns about illicit activities in the crypto space, Armstrong pushed back on the narrative that crypto is mainly used for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>He noted that, based on Coinbase&#8217;s observations, illicit activities in the crypto industry are less than 1%, contrasting it with illicit uses of cash, which he said is higher.</p>
<h2>SEC lawsuit</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Like Binance, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-coinbase-sued-by-sec-just-day-after-binance-lawsuit-which-firm-next.htm">Coinbase has been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), the main regulatory body overseeing financial markets in the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,‚Äù SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement when the lawsuit was announced in June this year.</p>
<p>Despite ongoing legal challenges, Armstrong in the interview expressed confidence in Coinbase&#8217;s ability to navigate the legal landscape, and denied claims that the lawsuit will force <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-pushes-toward-global-expansion-sets-sights-regulated-markets.htm">Coinbase to move its operations out of the US</a>.</p>

<p>TORN, the governance token of the Ethereum-based coin mixing protocol Tornado Cash, lost more than half of its value within just an hour on Monday after Binance said it would delist the token.</p>
<p>From trading at a price right around $4 at 6 am UTC time on Monday, TORN one hour later had collapsed to $1.95, a loss of around 52%.</p>
<p>Following the massive crash, the token briefly regained some if its losses, before sellers once again took control, sending it to lows of around $1.6, or almost 60% below the pre-announcement price.</p>

<h2>Binance to focus on regulatory compliance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Trading on Binance in the TORN/BUSD pair currently makes up more than 57% of the trading volume in TORN, and the delisting is therefore significant for the overall liquidity of the token.</p>
<p>At the same time, a review and delisting by a major exchange like Binance could very likely be followed by delistings from other exchanges, making the liquidity situation for TORN holders even worse.</p>
<p>The announcement from Binance came shortly after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">Richard Teng took over for Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO</a> of the exchange.</p>
<p>Among other things, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binances-new-ceo-teng-commits-to-more-regulatory-collaboration-is-this-a-new-chapter-for-binance.htm">Teng has vowed to do more to make Binance compliant</a> with regulations around the world.</p>
<h2>Controversial mixing service</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tornado Cash is a so-called coin mixing service that is used to obfuscate who the sender and receiver of an Ethereum transaction is.</p>
<p>The protocol has received its fair share of negative news coverage due to its popularity among hackers and cybercriminals.</p>
<p>In August of 2022, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/most-significant-legal-action-against-crypto-in-us-hodlnaut-halts-withdrawals-zipmex-releases-ethereum-bitcoin-more-news.htm">US Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash</a>, saying the mixing service ‚Äúhas repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors.‚Äù</p>
<p>In November the same year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-treasury-redesignates-sanctions-tornado-cash-crypto-mixer-citing-north-korea-involvement.htm">the department redesignated the sanctions</a>, saying North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group has used the service to launder more than $100 million in stolen funds.</p>

<p>As the crypto industry continues to evolve, a new wave of scams is emerging, blending the hype of artificial intelligence (AI) with crypto, Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tezos/">Tezos</a> blockchain, has warned.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/11/26/beware-of-crypto-grifters-looking-to-crash-the-ai-party/">commentary</a> piece for Fortune on Sunday, warned of a rising trend where opportunistic individuals are attempting to fuse these seemingly unrelated fields to capitalize on unsuspecting investors.</p>
<h2>Three types of AI-related crypto scams</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Breitman, there are three distinct flavors to this emerging trend.</p>
<p>The first involves using crypto tokens for accessing AI models or services, attempting to exploit the overlap in the usage of the term &#8220;tokens&#8221; in both AI and crypto contexts.</p>
<p>While some AI services accept crypto for payments, the linkage is often superficial, and entrepreneurs may attempt to convince investors otherwise, she said.</p>
<p>The second flavor revisits the notion that &#8220;data is the new oil,&#8221; a phrase from the 2017 boom in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-are-the-risks-in-an-ico.htm">initial coin offerings (ICO)</a> that has now become an internet meme.</p>
<p>According to the Tezos co-founder, scammers may peddle tokens claiming to reward individuals for contributing personal data to AI training models through supposed &#8220;data marketplaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her article, Breitman dismissed this concept, saying that personal data is in ‚Äúno sensible way‚Äù a monetizable asset.</p>
<p>Third, Breitman predicted the emergence of tokens explicitly branded with &#8220;AI&#8221; or &#8220;GPT&#8221; (based on the popular chat bot ChatGPT) in their names, capitalizing on the excitement surrounding these technologies.</p>
<h2>Crypto and AI merger make little sense</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In conclusion, Breitman stressed that the attempts that have been seen so far to merge AI and crypto make no sense in the eyes of genuine AI developers.</p>
<p>She also cautioned against falling for these &#8220;shoehorned&#8221; tokens, and said the crypto industry unfortunately has demonstrated a tendency to generate questionable business models with the hope of luring unsuspecting investors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis includes rebranding existing crypto businesses in hopes of dumping tokens on retail suckers,‚Äù she said, while reminding readers that the main value of crypto is to provide ‚Äúa censorship resistant store of value that unites people across borders.‚Äù</p>

<p>Creditors of the crypto derivatives exchange CoinFLEX are alleging that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/three-arrows-capital-founders-face-dubai-regulators-scrutiny-over-new-unregulated-exchange-opnx.htm">newly established creditor claims marketplace OPNX</a>, founded by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/three-arrows-capital-liquidators-request-contempt-sanctions-for-co-founder-kyle-davies-whats-going-on.htm">bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital</a> (3AC) co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, wrongfully used CoinFLEX assets without their consent.</p>
<p>The accusations are detailed in a writ of summons filed in the High Court of Hong Kong and was first <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coin-flex-creditors-unsatisfied-with-restructuring-process-to-opnx">reported</a> on by Cointelegraph on Thursday.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, Liquidity Technologies and Liquidity Technologies Software, entities associated with CoinFLEX&#8217;s original operations, claim that OPNX co-founder and former <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/creditors-of-struggling-crypto-exchange-coinflex-sue-ceo-and-seek-funds-from-bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver.htm">CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb misappropriated assets</a>, intellectual properties, and trade secrets of CoinFLEX during his tenure.</p>
<p>The filing alleged that Lamb diverted clients and business opportunities to OPNX, solicited employees and contractors, and engaged in actions detrimental to CoinFLEX creditors.</p>
<p>Critics argue that Lamb&#8217;s actions have included forging a fake non-disclosure agreement and falsely representing OPNX&#8217;s association with CoinFLEX creditors.</p>
<p>The accusations also highlight Lamb&#8217;s simultaneous involvement in setting up OPNX while serving as CoinFLEX&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>The legal action is a response to dissatisfaction with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-crypto-exchanges-trouble-nuri-files-for-insolvency-while-coinflex-files-for-restructuring.htm">restructuring of CoinFLEX</a>, which halted withdrawals, leading creditors to form an ad hoc committee for deliberations.</p>
<p>After the restructuring&#8217;s approval on March 7, creditors claim to have discovered Lamb&#8217;s actions against their interests, leading to the filing of the writ of summons.</p>
<p>The allegations have not been proven in the High Court of Hong Kong, and the legal proceedings add another layer of complexity to the ongoing drama.</p>
<p>OPNX, responding to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/su-zhu-of-three-arrows-capital-gets-restraining-order-against-billionaire-arthur-hayes-amid-dispute.htm">criticism from figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes</a>, asserts that its model benefits creditors by allowing them to sell claims on the exchange.</p>

<p>The idea of a Bitcoin supercycle, first introduced by Bitcoin educator Dan Held in 2020, is once again gaining traction in the community as Bitcoin is entering what some believe could be another long-term bullish phase.</p>
<p>The key driver behind this potential supercycle is a combination of factors, including Bitcoin&#8217;s programmed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-market-cycles-explained.htm">halving cycle every four years</a>, increased institutional adoption, and the expansion of use cases such as the Lightning Network and potentially Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-nfts-how-ordinals-proved-bitcoin-can-evolve-with-times.htm">Ordinals</a>.</p>
<p>It is believed that once these factors fully play out, Bitcoin ‚Äì and perhaps crypto more broadly ‚Äì will no longer be subject to the traditional boom-and-bust pattern observed in previous market cycles.</p>
<p>Despite these elements already being present to some extent, however, the previous cycle did not prevent another sharp market downturn that began at the end of 2021.</p>
<h2>Landscape shifting to favor a supercycle</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, the landscape may now be shifting, particularly in the United States, which constitutes a significant portion of global equity markets, crypto news outlet Cointelegraph speculated in an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-supercycle-2024-investment-trading">article</a> from Thursday.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/galaxy-digital-projects-bitcoin-price-reach-near-60000-year-after-spot-etf-approval.htm">potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> in the US, exemplified by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-community-divided-over-blackrocks-recent-bitcoin-etf-application.htm">BlackRock&#8217;s application</a> in June 2023, could provide the necessary institutional support that a Bitcoin supercycle would need.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/fitch-downgrades-us-governments-debt-rating-does-this-boost-cryptos-use-case.htm">downgrades in the US credit rating</a> by major agencies like Standard and Poor&#8217;s, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings also raise questions about the stability of the US dollar.</p>
<p>If hyperinflation becomes a concern, Bitcoin could emerge as a safe haven, mirroring trends observed in other countries facing economic uncertainties, the Cointelegraph report noted.</p>
<p>The ongoing trend of dedollarization and potential loss of confidence in fiat currencies more broadly may drive increased adoption, especially in countries facing economic challenges.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-halts-btc-sales-remain-bullish-price-ahead-of-halving.htm">upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024</a>, combined with potential institutional support and changing global economic dynamics, creates a landscape where the Bitcoin supercycle could materialize.</p>
<p>As the crypto community eagerly awaits developments in the coming years, the discussion around a potential Bitcoin supercycle continues to shape the narrative of the industry, with stakeholders closely monitoring key indicators and events that could propel Bitcoin into uncharted territory.</p>

<p>Blast, a newly launched Ethereum-based layer 2 network, is already gaining traction in the market after one unidentified whale deposited a massive 10,000 ETH to the network.</p>
<p>The deposit was made on Wednesday this week, just two days after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blur-founder-launches-new-layer-2-network-blast-raises-55-million-within-hours.htm">Blast went live in ‚Äúearly access‚Äù mode</a>.</p>
<p>Worth over $20 million in fiat terms by today‚Äôs price, the news of the massive on-chain transaction was shared on social media platform X by the popular community member Farokh.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome degen deposited 10,000 ETH into BLAST,‚Äù Farokh wrote, seemingly shocked that someone would deposit such a large amount on a newly launched blockchain project.</p>

<h2>Blast went live this week</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Blast was launched by Tieshun ‚ÄúPacman‚Äù Roquerre, who is also the founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur, on Monday this week.</p>
<p>According to an X post from the team behind the network, the plan is for Blast to become the first Ethereum layer 2 platform to introduce a built-in yield model.</p>
<p>The project raised some $20 million in initial funding, and continued to see on-chain investments in excess of $55 million within hours of its launch.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ethereum-based layer 2 networks like Blast have become more popular in recent years, partly thanks to increased transaction fees and slower transactions speeds on Ethereum‚Äôs base layer.</p>
<p>According to a report from blockchain intelligence firm Messari from last month, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/layer-2-networks-account-for-nearly-two-thirds-of-ethereum-transactions-report.htm">layer 2 networks now account for nearly two-thirds of all Ethereum transactions</a>.</p>
<p>According to Kunal Goel, a research analyst at Messari, the increased adoption of layer 2 networks in the third quarter of this year is largely a result of the¬†<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/base-network-outstrips-solanas-tvl-as-summer-lull-draws-close.htm">growing adoption of Coinbase‚Äôs layer 2 network Base</a>.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Base in August, it has lived up to its expectations with growing transactions and use cases and temporarily recording more activity than Ethereum‚Äôs main network at one point.</p>

<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has added fuel to the frenzy surrounding the Solana-based meme coin BONK by <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-futures-will-launch-usd%E2%93%A2-m-1000bonk-and-pyth-perpetual-contracts-with-up-to-50x-leverage-7b3f500e0eec40f380023b4ff0ccca18">announcing</a> the launch of a BONK futures offering.</p>
<p>The listing comes as BONK has seen a dramatic surge in the market, rising more than 50% in the past 7 days alone, per data from CoinGecko.</p>
<p>The token has been making new all-time highs on a daily basis as of late, after breaking through its previous all-time high from January this year earlier this week.</p>
<p>As of press time on Thursday, BONK had a market capitalization of just over $270 million, ranking it as 158<sup>th</sup> most valuable cryptoasset by market cap, per CoinGecko‚Äôs ranking.</p>

<p>The new listing on Binance Futures is for USD‚ìà-M 1000BONK, a USD-margined and settled contract with leverage up to 50x.</p>
<p>The surge in BONK&#8217;s popularity is seen by some as riding the coattails of Solana&#8217;s recent success, marked by a surge in the price of the network‚Äôs native token SOL.</p>
<p>While SOL has experienced an impressive 80% gain over the last 30 days, BONK easily outshone its counterpart with a huge gain of roughly 1,200% over the same time period.</p>
<h2>PYTH listing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Besides BONK, Binance on Wednesday also announced the listing of a perpetual futures contract for PYTH, another hot Solana-based token.</p>
<p>The new listings are scheduled to go live on November 22, 2023, at 14:00 (UTC) and 14:30 (UTC), respectively.</p>
<h2>First listings by new Binance CEO</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The addition of BONK and PYTH to Binance&#8217;s platform is particularly noteworthy in light of recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">challenges faced by the exchange</a>, including the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">departure of high-profile founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ)</a>, as well as significant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-sees-more-than-900-million-in-outflows-as-former-ceo-pleads-guilty.htm">outflows that on Wednesday reached $900 million</a> in 24 hours.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the new listings are part of a marketing strategy orchestrated by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-says-exchange-has-robust-revenues-and-profits-hinting-at-ability-to-pay-4-3b-fines.htm">new Binance CEO, Richard Teng</a>.</p>
