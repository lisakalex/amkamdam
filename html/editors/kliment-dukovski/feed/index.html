<h2><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334962/10-best-cold-wallets.jpg" alt="10 best cold wallets" width="854" /></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Cold wallets, also known as hardware wallets, are one of the safest storage solutions for your cryptocurrencies. That’s because they store your wallet’s seed phrase offline while being encrypted. In other words, if a hacker compromises your computer, they won’t be able to see the seed phrase and steal your funds.</p>
<p>What’s more, hardware wallets require that you authorize each transaction by pressing physical buttons. So unless someone holds your hardware wallet and knows your PIN number to unlock it, they can never transfer funds out of your cold wallet. Given that over <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/01/tech/crypto-hacks-2022/index.html"><u>$3.8 billion worth of crypto was stolen in hacks in 2022</u></a>, having a cold wallet could have saved you from being in such a statistic.</p>
<p>To find the best cold wallets this year, we compared multiple options in terms of features and ease of use. Read more to find our top picks.</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Cold Crypto Wallets Reviewed</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the most popular cold storage wallets that crypto investors are using right now to secure their altcoin holdings. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Ledger Nano S Plus — Overall Best Cold Crypto Wallet, Supported By Live App</strong></h3>
<p>This is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger’s</u></a> entry-level wallet. But don’t let this fool you. Ledger Nano S Plus offers the same functionality as the more expensive Ledger Nano X. The main difference between the two is that the Ledger Nano X has Bluetooth and it feels like it’s made with higher-quality materials.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334939/ledger-nano-s-plus.jpg" alt="Ledger Nano S Plus" width="900" /></figure>
<p><br />The app that all Ledger devices use is called Ledger Live. This is both a mobile app and a desktop app. You can use it to buy coins with a credit card, swap them using decentralized exchanges like 1Inch and others, or stake your coins.</p>
<p>Ledger Nano S Plus supports over 5,500 coins, which is the same as the more expensive Nano X version, and you can also hold NFTs in your wallet.</p>
<p>Since it doesn’t support Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect your Ledger cold wallet via a USB-C cable with your smartphone or computer. This shouldn’t be a big deal if you mostly use your Ledger wallet for storing coins. If you plan to actively transfer coins or trade, the Ledger Nano X could be the better option due to its Bluetooth support.</p>
<p>Ledger’s support is top-notch. If something happens to your device, say it breaks or malfunctions, Ledger will send you a replacement free of charge. All this makes Ledger Nano S Plus the best cold wallet in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Over 5,500 coins and tokens supported</li>
<li>Multiple accessories to customize your Ledger</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>
<li>No wallet seed phrase backup recovery yet</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2. Trezor Safe 3 — Obscure Transactions &amp; Restore Your Seed Phrase if Lost</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><u>Trezor Safe 3</u></a> is the best offering from Trezor because it offers the same functionality as the most expensive cold wallet but at an affordable price. Trezor Safe 3 comes with a monochromatic OLED screen where you can see the transaction information, and USB-C connectivity since it doesn’t have Bluetooth.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be a dealbreaker, though, as cold wallets are designed for long-term storage and not active trading.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334943/trezor-safe-3.jpg" alt="Trezor Safe 3" width="900" /></figure>
<p>Some of the safety features of this Trezor cold wallet include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup, which splits your seed phrase into up to 16 pieces to help you recover your seed phrase if you lose it, meaning if you lose one piece or it gets stolen, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>As a companion to this Trezor cold wallet is the Trezor Suite app available on mobile, desktop and browser. Via the app, you can send, receive and trade over 8,000 cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>Unlike most cold wallets, Trezor has open-source software, which can be examined by anyone to ensure it&#8217;s safe. Another interesting feature is that you can go incognito with Coinjoin, which lumps multiple transactions into one, thus obscuring your transactions, and you can protect your identity with Tor.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trezor Suite mobile, browser and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports sending, receiving and trading via the app</li>
<li>Affordable price</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Bluetooth</li>

<h3><strong>3. Ledger Stax — Store Over 5,000 Cryptocurrencies, Wireless Charging &amp; Bluetooth Connectivity</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ledger/"><u>Ledger Stax</u></a> is one of the most innovative cold wallets you can find. It looks like a small ebook reader because of its curved E Ink touchscreen. Because of that, it is mostly designed for storing your NFT collections because you can put your favorite NFT on the screen like an ebook cover.</p>
<p>Aside from its interesting design, it supports wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and it’s highly customizable. This means you can connect your Stax with your Ledger Live mobile app and sign transactions without using cables.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334944/ledger-stax.jpg" alt="Ledger Stax" width="900" /></figure>
<p>As the name suggests, you can “stack” multiple Stax wallets one on top of the other, if you have multiple wallets. For example, one Stax could hold your Ethereum NFTs, a second one could store your Solana NFTs, and a third could store your coins.</p>
<p>Of course, one Stax is enough to hold all of the above. But if you want to have multiple Stax’s, say one for yourself, another for a family member, all with different screen images, you can easily do so.</p>
<p>Similar to the other two Ledgers, Stax uses the Ledger Live mobile and desktop app to swap coins, stake coins or buy them with a card. Also, the Ledger Live app is used to update your cold wallet’s firmware.</p>
<p>With all these features and functionality, Stax comes with an eye-watering price of around $279, which is on the higher end compared to other cold wallets. Despite that, if you are an NFT enthusiast and you can afford it, Stax is one of the best cold wallets you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger Live mobile and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports staking, swapping and buying with a card</li>
<li>Bluetooth and wireless charging</li>
<li>E Ink touchscreen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More expensive than other cold wallets</li>

<h3><strong>4. Trezor Model T — Color Touchscreen Buttons &amp; Added Protection Via MicroSD Card Encrypted PIN</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/trezor/"><u>Trezor Model T</u></a> is Trezor’s premium model that comes with a color LCD touchscreen instead of physical buttons and a micro SD card slot. The first is mostly a design feature, while the second is a premium protection feature. The way it works is, if you enable it, <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/press/thoughtleadership/sd-memory-cards-secure-store-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-offline/"><i><u>a randomly generated secret is stored on the SD card that you can insert into your Trezor Model T for extra protection</u></i></a>.</p>
<p>Everything else is the same as with the other Trezor models. For example, you get access to a mobile, desktop and browser app called Trezor Suite. This comes with coin swapping and trading, as well as sending and receiving coins.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334945/trezor-model-t.jpg" alt="Trezor Model T" width="900" /></figure>
<p>If you want to obscure some of your transactions, you can do so with Coinjoin, which, as the name suggests, “joins” multiple transactions into one to make it hard for outsiders to tell which transaction was yours. This feature is available to the other Trezor models as well.</p>
<p>Some of its safety features include the Secure Element (EAL6+) and the passphrase to unlock your device, which makes it hard for hackers to steal your assets. Another safety feature of Trezor cold wallets is the Shamir Backup. This splits your seed phrase into multiple pieces and even if one piece gets lost or is stolen, you can still recover your assets with the remaining pieces.</p>

<ul>
<li>Trezor Suite mobile, browser and desktop app</li>
<li>Supports sending, receiving and trading via the app</li>
<li>LCD Touchscreen</li>
<li>Micro SD card protection</li>

<h3><strong>5. ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet — Fully Metal-Sealed With Auto-Self Destruct if Tampering is Detected</strong> </h3>
<p>ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet is one of the leading cold wallets due to its safety features and usability with an affordable price compared to similar cold wallets.</p>
<p>For starters, the Titan Cold Wallet is designed with 100% security in mind. It’s air-gapped, meaning there’s no Bluetooth, WiFi or cellular connection, and it uses anti-disassembly and anti-tamper technology that it “self-destructs” if it detects tampering. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334946/ellipal-titan.jpg" alt="ELLIPAL Titan Cold Wallet" width="900" /></figure>
<p>The wallet firmware is updated offline using micro SD cards, meaning you don’t need a US connection to update it. Also, you can activate two-factor authentication, PIN or password to unlock your device.</p>
<p>The wallet supports over 10,000 coins and NFTs without installing any apps as you need with other cold wallets.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-tampering removes your information from the device</li>
<li>10,000 coins and NFTs supported</li>
<li>Micro SD card protection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<h3><strong>6. KeepKey — Affordable Option With Native Thorchain Exchange Integration </strong></h3>
<p>KeepKey is an affordable cold wallet with integrated Thorchain exchange for seamless swapping of coins and a Dapp Store where you can connect to decentralized applications like OpenSea to exchange NFTs, Uniswap, Etherscan and 1inch exchange.</p>
<p>To access the Dapp Store, you need to download the KeepKey desktop app. Via the app, you can manage your crypto portfolio by exchanging or transacting over 2,500 supported coins and NFTs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334947/keepkey.jpg" alt="KeepKey" width="900" /></figure>
<p>To increase your wallet’s security, KeepKey supports a PIN number or two-factor authentication to access your device. This means even if someone steals your KeepKey wallet, they won’t be able to access it unless they can go through these two safety features.</p>
<p>Given the wallet costs around $79, there are no premium features like Bluetooth or wireless support. You’ll need to use a micro USB cable to connect to your computer to authorize transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Affordable price</li>
<li>2,500 coins and tokens supported</li>
<li>Desktop app</li>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>7. Blockstream Jade — Bitcoin-Only Crypto Cold Wallet With Multisig Technology</strong></h3>
<p>Blockstream Jade is a Bitcoin-only cold wallet that comes with several unique features, including a camera for scanning QR codes and multisig technology that requires multiple keys to send a transaction, which makes it even harder for hackers and scammers to steal your funds.</p>
<p>With multisig, there are two keys: the first key is held on your device, which is backed by your seed phrase, and the second key is held on the Blockstream Green servers, which are protected by two-factor authentication.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a Cryptocurrency Cold Wallet?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A crypto cold storage wallet, also known as a hardware wallet, is a device with specifically designed hardware to encrypt and store your wallet’s seed phrase offline and in a safe environment. Hot wallets, on the other hand, store your seed phrase online. If a hacker has access to your computer, they can see your seed phrase and use it to steal your funds.</p>
<p>Cold wallets typically have physical buttons, or touchscreen buttons depending on the device, which are used for signing transactions on the blockchain. This makes it hard for scammers and hackers to steal your funds unless they physically hold the device. What’s more, each cold wallet is locked with a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA. The fraudsters will also need to know that to unlock your wallet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334952/ledger.jpg" alt="Ledged crypto app" width="900" /><br />Using a companion app, these wallets can store crypto assets including cryptocurrencies and NFTs. You can also trade, swap, stake and more with these apps, giving cold wallets the same functionality as hot wallets but with added security.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can connect your cold wallet to a hot wallet like MetaMask or Phantom, which makes connecting to DeFi applications seamless. For every transaction you make, you will have to sign it with the buttons on your device.</p>
<h2><strong>How do Cold Wallets Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>All cold storage crypto wallets have a seed phrase, consisting of 12 or 24 words, which you can use to restore your wallet and access your crypto funds in case something happens to your computer or smartphone. That’s because your crypto wallet and assets are stored on the blockchain. Using the seed phrase you actually prove that you own the wallet.</p>
<h3><strong>Cold Wallets Store Your Seed Phrase Offline</strong></h3>
<p>Cold wallets generate and store the user’s private keys on the physical device. This means the seed phrase is never exposed on your computer screen while you’re connected to the Internet. This way, hackers can never see your seed phrase via your computer even if your computer is compromised.</p>
<p>If the user needs to restore a private key, they enter the seed phrase directly on the device itself, which is encrypted and offline.</p>
<h3><strong>You Need to Press a Button to Sign Transactions</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from keeping your seed phrase safe, cold wallets have another safety feature. You have to physically press buttons on the cold wallet to authorize transactions. This way, no one can authorize the transaction except the person who holds the cold wallet device.</p>
<p>To increase security, cold wallets use a PIN number, a passphrase or 2FA to unlock the device. If someone manages to steal your hardware wallet, they would need to know your access codes to unlock it.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Why Is The Seed Phrase Important?</strong></h3>
<p>The crypto wallet seed phrase, often made of 12 to 24 randomly generated words, is the backup key to your wallet. This sequence of words is linked to the private keys and acts as a mnemonic representation to retrieve access to the assets within the wallet.</p>
<p>For example, you create a crypto wallet and you don’t save the seed phrase. If you need to reinstall your operating system, someone steals your computer or your cold wallet breaks and you don’t know your wallet’s seed phrase, you won’t be able to access your digital wallet and your funds will be trapped.</p>
<p>To protect your seed phrase, you need to write it down on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe. Some cold wallet providers, like Ledger, sell metal seed phrase protectors that can withstand fire and damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Advantages of Cold Crypto Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The main advantage of a cold wallet is enhanced security. Since you need to physically press buttons on the wallet, you are safe from remote access hacks. </p>
<h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>
<p>The best advantage of cold crypto wallets is their superior protection against online vulnerabilities. Cold wallets aren’t connected to the internet, making them immune to cyber attacks.</p>
<p>This includes protection from hacking attempts, phishing schemes, malware infections and other malicious activities. By storing private keys offline, cold wallets ensure that access to your funds is protected. </p>
<h3><strong>Unauthorized Access Protection</strong></h3>
<p>Cold wallets require that you physically press a button to sign a transaction. In the unfortunate event that a malicious actor has gained access to your computer accounts and companion cold wallet app, they can’t move your funds without you pressing the buttons.</p>
<p>This acts as a physical barrier against unauthorized access and theft, giving you peace of mind that your funds are protected even when you sleep.</p>
<h3><strong>Long-Term Safekeeping</strong></h3>
<p>Crypto cold wallets are designed for the long-term storing of your crypto assets. That’s because the safety feature of pressing buttons to authorize transactions can become a nuisance if you plan to use your cold wallet device for active trading. What’s more, active trading requires that you connect to multiple decentralized apps, which could potentially pose a threat if they’re hacked.</p>
<p>Unlike hot wallets, which are designed for frequent transactions and daily use, cold wallets are better suited for &#8220;hodling&#8221;, which is for keeping your assets safe long-term.</p>
<h3><strong>Immune to Platform Failures</strong></h3>
<p>Online platforms and exchanges are known to experience downtimes, glitches and even hacks. For example, <a href="https://decrypt.co/150669/defi-exchange-curve-finance-confirms-various-ethereum-pools-hacked"><u>DeFi exchange Curve Finance had various Ethereum pools hacked</u></a> where $52 million were stolen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/13/north-korean-attackers-linked-to-54m-coinex-hack-blockchain-data-suggests/"><u>CoinEx lost $54 million in a hack</u></a>. If you had funds in these two platforms or any other where the assets were compromised, you could have lost all your funds.</p>
<p>Cold wallets eliminate this risk because you have full control over your assets and how they move.</p>
<h2><strong>Cold Wallets vs Hot Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Both cold wallets and hot wallets are designed to store your digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But there are some differences between the two.</p>
<h3><strong>Assets Safety</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main differences between cold wallets and hot wallets is safety. Hot wallets provide you with a seed phrase visible on your computer screen or smartphone when you open a new wallet. Cold wallets, on the other hand, provide you with a seed phrase directly on the screen of the hardware wallet, which isn’t connected to the internet.</p>
<p>This means that unless someone looks directly at your hardware wallet’s screen when you read and write the 12 to 24 words, there is no way that they can know your seed phrase to steal your funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Transaction Execution</strong></h3>
<p>Another difference between these two types of wallets is how transactions are executed. You can sign transactions with one click using hot wallets, which makes it an excellent choice for frequent trading or using decentralized apps.</p>
<p>Cold wallets, however, have buttons that you have to physically press to sign the transaction. What’s more, you need to unlock your crypto cold wallet device with a PIN, a passphrase or 2FA. This makes signing transactions more complex but also safer.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Due to being safer, the best cold wallets are designed for long-term safekeeping. This means that once you buy your crypto assets, you send them to your cold wallet and you leave them there until you decide to sell.</p>
<p>Hot wallets are designed to be exploited daily. Connect your hot wallets to decentralized exchanges, yield farming protocols or NFT marketplaces and feel free to continuously sign transactions. You can always move your profits into your cold wallets for safekeeping.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose a Cold Cryptocurrency Wallet</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Choosing the best cold wallet is a decision that requires weighing in several factors, including security features, supported cryptocurrencies, mobile app experience as well as pricing.</p>
<h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3>
<p>This is the main reason to get a cold wallet. But there are nuances that you have to consider as not all cold wallets are created equal. For example, some users prefer Bluetooth connectivity so they can easily sign transactions on their smartphones without using cables.</p>
<p>Other users may consider Bluetooth as a liability and prefer to have air-gapped devices, meaning they have no wireless contact of any kind that could compromise security.</p>
<p>Also, look for wallets that have a proven track record of security, like Ledger and Trezor, which employ strong encryption methods. Additionally, consider the wallet&#8217;s recovery options. In case the wallet is lost or damaged you will have to use your seed phrase to access your wallet.</p>
<p>But sometimes you could lose your seed phrase as well. Every Trezor cold wallet has a solution for this via something called Shamir Backup where you split your seed phrase into several pieces. If one piece is lost or stolen, you can still recover your wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334956/ledger-recover.jpg" alt="Ledger Recover" width="900" /></figure>
<p>Ledger has recently employed a similar <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/24/crypto-wallet-maker-ledger-officially-rolls-out-recover-unleashing-fresh-round-of-snark/"><u>wallet recovery feature called Ledger Recover</u></a>. This is a paid feature where you have to submit valid ID documents and a selfie recording. Once approved, your device will encrypt your seed phrase and split it into three fragments, which will be used to recover your seed phrase. Because your seed phrase is locked to your ID, you can be the only one who can request the recovery fragments.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>What is Shamir Backup?</strong></h3>
<p>Shamir Backup is a security standard that aims to protect your seed phrase. The way it works is your seed phrase is split up into pieces, called recovery shares, and you can store them at various places. If one of the pieces is lost or damaged, you can still recover your assets.</p>
<p>Recovery shares are sequences of 20 or 33 words that carry part of the cryptographic secret. When you combine the number of shares you create a master seed, which you can use to recover your wallet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3>
<p>Most crypto cold wallets support the most popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, but they also support thousands of other coins and tokens. However, some wallets, like Blockstream Jade, support only Bitcoin and no other coin.</p>
<p>That is why you have to consider what you really need before buying a cold wallet. If you only want to hold Bitcoin and sell it in 10 years, then Blockstream Jade could be a perfect wallet; it’s cheaper, it’s reliable and it’s safe. But if you want to store multiple coins and do multi-chain swaps, then Trezor or Ledger wallets are typically the way to go.</p>
<h3><strong>Companion Mobile App</strong></h3>
<p>Even though cold wallets are designed to be offline storage devices, most of them come with companion mobile apps that allow you to monitor your portfolio, to initiate transactions, to stake your idle coins, to use decentralized apps like Uniswap and 1inch exchange, and more.</p>
<p>That is why it’s important to consider cold storage wallets that meet your requirements. Ledger’s Ledger Live app is one of the best companion apps, where you can stake your idle coins. This feature isn’t available in most other cold wallet apps.</p>
<p>Another valuable app is the Trezor Suite, which has similar functionalities to Ledger Live, but it can also help obscure your transactions with Coinjoin.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/guide/126852/334958/trezor-suite.jpg" alt="Trezor Suite" width="900" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Device Cost</strong></h3>
<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/21/mark-cuban-lost-nearly-900000-dollars-to-crypto-hackers.html"><u>Mark Cuban lost nearly $900,000 to crypto hackers</u></a> by installing a fake MetaMask app. If this happened to him it could happen to everyone. That’s why it’s important to own a cold wallet and never share your seed phrase regardless of the device’s cost.</p>
<p>However, if two or more devices share a similar price point while offering the same functionality, you could spend the extra money investing in crypto. Compare the wallets you are willing to get and see whether paying a premium is worth it.</p>
<h2><strong>Limitations of Cold Wallets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While cold wallets offer security advantages, there are some limitations to consider. Before opting for a cold wallet, weigh the benefits against the potential inconveniences associated with cold storage.</p>
<p>Susceptible to physical attacks. Someone could steal your hardware wallet or it could be damaged or lost. If you don’t have your seed phrase ready, you won’t be able to recover your assets.</p>
<p>Regular transactions. Cold wallets are designed for storage, which makes them inconvenient for everyday transaction signing. That’s because you have to physically press a button every time you wish to make a transaction. If you’re making hundreds of transactions each day, it could be tedious to approve them every time on your hardware wallet.</p>
<p>Cost. While hot wallets are free to use, cold wallets come with a purchase price. Of course, this is a small price to pay for the safety of your crypto assets. But you still have to weigh in whether you really need a cold wallet or not for your intended use cases.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The 10 best cold wallets for 2023 stand out not only for their robust security features but also for their user-friendly companion apps, a wide range of coin support and innovative functionalities. Whether you’re a beginner in the crypto space or a seasoned investor, buying a cold wallet is probably one of the most prudent investments you can make.</p>
<p>Consider one of the three Ledger devices to hold your crypto assets. These are some of the best on the market, with strong safety features and a mobile app that lets you stake your coins or trade them whenever you want.</p>
<p>Ledger S Plus supports over 5,500 coins for an affordable price. But if you’re looking for Bluetooth connectivity, Ledger Nano X could be a better option.</p>

<p>The best gambling tokens excel in rewards, utility and security. The way they work is designed to entice new users to join the ecosystem, which in turn should positively impact the token price.  </p>
<h3><strong>1.TG.Casino Token — Best Online Casino Presale Where You Can Stake Your Tokens During the Presale And Earn a Portion of The Casino’s Daily Profits</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino/en"><u>TG.Casino token</u></a> aims to join the big league of online gambling by merging online casino games, cryptocurrencies and Telegram gambling. Its token is the $TGC and is now available for presale at a listing price of $0.125.</p>
<p>There’s already over $230,000 raised in a few days with a soft cap of reaching $1 million, which is likely to happen very soon. <i>Update</i> &#8211; over $1 million has now been raised.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332100/tgc.jpg" alt="TG Casino token presale page" /></figure>
<p>You can buy $TGC tokens in the presale with ETH, BNB and USDT and get additional benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rewards </strong>once TG.Casino goes live on Telegram.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive NFTs and post-launch rewards </strong>for those who invest over $5,000 in the presale.</li>
<li><strong>TGC staking </strong>during the presale, which gives you the opportunity to earn more tokens before the launch on major exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently staking APY stands close to 2,000%, which can give a huge boost to those who get in early.</p>
<p>As a $TGC token holder, you will earn 60% of the TG.Casino daily profit, while 40% of the profit will be burned to lower the token supply and help push the price up, according to <a href="https://tg-casino.gitbook.io/tg.casino-whitepaper/"><u>TG.Casino’s whitepaper</u></a>. Both of these features are designed to provide value for $TGC token holders.</p>
<p>There will be 100 million tokens in total, 40 million of which are dedicated to the presale and 20 million for the staking rewards. The good news is that there’s no vesting for your presale tokens, meaning you can sell them as soon as the token launches on major exchanges. The token launch is planned after the presale ends.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332101/tgc2.jpg" alt="TG Casino tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>As for the casino itself, there won’t be any Know Your Customer (KYC) process involved, which makes gambling anonymous. Also, there won’t be any account setup, and you can play the casino games on your smartphone via the Telegram app.</p>
<p>TG.Casino will offer hundreds of games, including slots, poker, table games and more. There will also be sports books with more than 30 different sports you can bet on, which makes it one of the best Telegram gambling tokens.</p>
<p>The casino is fully licensed and based in Curacao. To get more updates, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/TGCasino_"><u>TG.Casino on X</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/TG_CasinoCommunity"><u>Telegram</u></a>.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Meme Kombat — New Token Presale That Lets You Wager on Meme Battles and Earn 112% Staking Rewards During the Presale</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en"><u>Meme Kombat</u></a> is a new presale that has already raised over $100,000 in a few days after launch. That’s not a surprise given how Meme Kombat rides upon the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-meme-coins-are-trending-again-52be1289"><u>meme tokens wave</u></a>, which has proven to be loved by crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t just a meme token — it’s part of an upcoming meme battle arena where you can pit memes and bet on them. If you ever wondered whether DOGE can beat Shiba Inu, now you’ll find out, and you can even profit if you bet on the winner.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332102/memekombat.jpg" alt="Meme Kombat token presale page" /></figure>
<p>The way it will work is each meme character has a card with skills and stats. Outcomes of each battle are executed in real-time on the blockchain by an AI-generated random event. Learn more about the mechanics in <a href="https://memekombattoken.gitbook.io/meme-kombat-whitepaper/"><u>Meme Kombat’s whitepaper</u></a>.</p>
<p>There will be several betting opportunities, such as player vs. player where you bet against other players; player vs. game where you wager on the outcomes of battles against the game where each meme character has different odds; direct betting where you can wager on specific battles or characters; and side action betting where you can dig deeper and wager on battle events like how will a certain character win.</p>
<p>All this adds complexity and fun to betting while giving you the chance to earn tokens at the same time.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Meme Kombat’s token is $MK and it comes with two main use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wagering.</strong> $MK token holders can bet their tokens on the outcomes of meme character battles. Winners take valuable prizes, including $MK tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Staking.</strong> Stake your tokens to earn a passive annual percentage yield (APY), which stands at 112%. This is an excellent opportunity to increase your token holdings while the presale is still ongoing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Purchase $MK tokens in a presale using ETH, BNB or USDT, where the price of each $MK token is $1.667.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332103/memek.jpg" alt="MK tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The total presale supply is 6 million tokens, which is 50% of the MK total supply. Once the presale ends, which is planned for late Q3 2023, the game will launch Season 1. This will feature battles, leaderboards and more.</p>
<p>Seeing how meme tokens sell out fast, this presale may not last long. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Meme_Kombat"><u>Meme Kombat on X</u></a> and on <a href="https://t.me/MemeKombatToken"><u>Meme Kombat’s Telegram</u></a> channel to get updates. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Rollbit Coin — A Leading Online Casino Where You Can Play Games, Bet on Sports, Trade NFTs and Crypto Futures With 1,000x Leverage</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rollbit.com/"><u>Rollbit</u></a> is a crypto casino founded in early 2020 on the Solana blockchain but got an upgrade in March 2021, and recently moved to Ethereum. The casino offers a variety of gambling games, such as slots, roulette, and blackjack, as well as sports betting in sports and esports like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike. This is a rare feature as most online casinos offer betting only on traditional sports.</p>
<p>Aside from gambling, you can trade NFTs or get loans by using your NFTs as collateral. For seasoned traders, Rollbit offers crypto futures with up to 1,000x leverage. This means you can quickly make a lot of money, but you can just as quickly lose them.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332104/rollbit.jpg" alt="Rollbit online casino" /></figure>
<p>One of the reasons for Rollbit’s success could be attributed to catering both to Web3 and Web2 users. You can sign in with an email or via your Steam or Twitch accounts. If you’re wondering how to gamble with cryptocurrency, the Web3 part lets you connect via the MetaMask crypto wallet. You can deposit funds via card or Google and Apple Pay, making it even more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>In August 2023, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/09/rollbits-rlb-token-rockets-60-as-crypto-casino-bets-on-daily-token-burn/"><u>one of the co-founders said the casino would buy 60% of all fees</u></a> generated and burn them to increase demand for the token. And it seemed to be working. The token was up 60% after the announcement.</p>
<p>The platform’s token RLB was created in November 2021 and was airdropped to Rollbit users. With the token, you can stake it to earn rewards or participate in a lottery and other activities on the platform. You can earn a 10% cut of the RLB tokens the team buys for burning if you <a href="https://twitter.com/rollbitcom/status/1690359480910032896"><u>get a Rollbot NFT and stake it</u></a>.</p>
<p>All this potentially makes Rollbit one of the best gambling tokens to buy now.</p>

<h3><strong>4. FUNToken — A Gaming Platform That Helps Onboard Gamers and Game Developers Into the Web3 Gaming Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://funtoken.io/"><u>FUNToken</u></a> is designed to give developers, gamers and gaming operators transparency and economic opportunity as they are integrated into the cryptocurrency world.</p>
<p>There are two tokens on the platform: FUN token, which is on the Ethereum network, and XFUN token, which is on the Polygon network. Polygon is a layer 2 Ethereum blockchain that makes transactions faster and cheaper. Both tokens have a 1:1 ratio and you can easily swap them in the platform’s proprietary XFUN Wallet.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332105/funtoken.jpg" alt="FUNToken crypto project" /></figure>
<p>The platform has several dApps that can be used by gaming studios to build an online casino or a betting platform. There’s also a software solution for arcade gaming platforms and metaverses.</p>
<p>The idea is to use the FUN token by any other game that utilizes FUNToken’s gaming solutions. In other words, you can build an online crypto game that uses the FUN token, which should drive token demand as more games are being built on the platform.</p>
<p>You can buy the FUN token on multiple centralized exchanges.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Solcasino — The Most Popular Online Casino on The Solana Blockchain That Shares Revenue With the NFT Holders and Gives Rakeback Rewards</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://solcasino.io/"><u>Solcasino</u></a> is one of the leading casinos on the Solana blockchain and the first Solana casino licensed in Curacao. There, you can play a variety of gambling crypto games like slots, roulette and card games but you can also bet on sporting events. Some of the games have a prize pool where the winner takes it all.</p>
<p>The platform’s native currency is SCS, which you can stake to earn an annual percentage rate (APR) of 58%. However, you’re not limited to SCS, you can use other Solana tokens like BONK, SAMO, DUST, SOL, USDC and more to play and bet on sporting events.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332106/solcasino.jpg" alt="Solcasino crypto gambling site" /></figure>
<p>Even though Solana is the native blockchain for Solcasino, there is multi-chain support for BTC, ETH, BNB, MATIC, APTOS, CANTO and FTM.</p>
<p>There’s also an ongoing lottery where the prizes can reach up to $100,000 for a ticket price of $2. </p>
<p>The most useful feature is undoubtedly Solcasino’s NFTs. These participate in the casino’s revenue share when you lock them up for staking for a period of time. You can also earn rakeback, which is a reward you earn when you play on the Solcasino. This makes SCS one of the best gambling tokens on Solana and one of the most popular gambling tokens overall.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Decentral Games DG — An Online Casino Built in The Decentraland Metaverse Where You Can Earn Prizes Like MacBooks, iPhones and Airpods</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://decentral.games/"><u>Decentral Games</u></a> is an online casino built in the Decentraland metaverse. You can play poker in the virtual world or you can do it in your browser. And that’s all you can do. There are no hundreds of casino games or sports betting. It’s just playing poker virtually.</p>
<p>That’s not all bad, however. Decentraland was one of the most popular metaverses, which saw <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-expensive-virtual-plot-land-185000712.html"><u>virtual plots of land sell for $900,000</u></a> and another <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/virtual-real-estate-plot-sells-record-24-million-2021-11-23/"><u>Decentraland plot sold for $2.4 million</u></a> during the bull run of 2021. Whether the next bull run repeats these figures remains to be seen.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332107/decentral-games.jpg" alt="Decentraland ICE poker arcade" /></figure>
<p>The Decentraland Games token is DG, which is an ERC-20 token, also used as a governance token in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This also makes you a partial owner of the casino. The DAO treasury currently has around $9.8 worth of ERC-20 tokens and by voting you can decide what can be done with these funds.</p>
<p>To play, create an account by signing in with your email or using Twitter or Discord accounts to log in. To participate in the games, you need at least one ICE NFT wearable, which gets you a set number of chips to play.</p>
<p>Prizes include MacBooks, iPhones, Airpods and more.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Exceedme — An Esports Gaming Platform Where Gamers Earn XED Tokens by Winning a Prize Pool or by Betting</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://exeedme.com/"><u>Exceedme</u></a> isn’t an online casino, but a tournament platform where gamers can play competitive games like Counter-Strike, Dota 2, Valorant and Call of Duty and earn rewards. These games can be played between friends in competitive matches with stakes or in matchmaking tournaments.</p>
<p>By playing, gamers earn the XED token, which can be used to level up and gain access to higher leagues with higher stakes and rewards. XED is an ERC-20 token, but there’s also a Polygon and BNB Smart Chain version.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332108/exceed.jpg" alt="Exceedme online gambling site" /></figure>
<p>Win or lose, players still earn XED tokens for their participation in the platform. By playing more, gamers get to unlock achievements that come with NFTs. These are tradable within the platform, which can be an additional income for active players.</p>
<p>Betting with cryptocurrency is something users on the platform can do. But you’ll need to stake your XED tokens first. The more tokens you stake, the higher wager limits you get in matchmaking. </p>
<p>You can redeem your tokens for Counter-Strike skins and gift cards for Playstation, Steam, Fortnite, Blizzard and more.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Blockchainbets — An Online Casino That Shares 100% of The Profit With BCB Token Holders Who Stake</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://blockchainbets.club/"><u>Blockchainbets</u></a> is an online casino with table games, poker, slots, jackpots and even scratch cards. There are also sports betting on popular sports like football, MMA, tennis and basketball. </p>
<p>You can use the platform anonymously as it doesn’t require KYC. All you need is a crypto wallet like MetaMask and you’re good to go.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332109/bcb.jpg" alt="Blockchainbets web3 gambling site" /></figure>
<p>For gambling with cryptocurrency, you would need USDT even though the platform’s token is BCB. The BCB is an ERC-20 token.</p>
<p>Similar to other online casinos, you can stake your tokens to get a revenue share. In this case, 100% of the casino profit is shared among stakers. And if you lock your tokens for a certain amount of time, you can get an APR boost. A seven-day lock gives you a 3x boost, while a 30-day lock gives you 6x boost on the tokens you earn. </p>
<p>There are 877 million in circulation out of 1 billion tokens. The rest have been burned so far.</p>

<h2><strong>What are Gambling Tokens?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Gambling cryptocurrency, also known as &#8216;GambleFi&#8217;, continues to evolve by integrating blockchain technology and crypto trends. These tokens often act as digital currency used exclusively on gambling platforms, which allows users to participate in betting activities, play online casino games, and access gambling with crypto.</p>
<p>These tokens can also be used to vote in a DAO, if the token has one, or stake them to earn a revenue share. These two aspects reflect the industry&#8217;s shift towards decentralization.</p>
<p>Another feature of the best gambling tokens is transparency. This comes as an integral part of blockchain technology whose ledgers are immutable and available for everyone to see. This can help in building trust among users, as they can verify the fairness of games and the distribution of rewards.</p>
<p>On top of that, gambling tokens in 2023 offer anonymity and privacy. Users can engage in online gambling crypto activities without revealing their personal and financial information, which isn’t the case with traditional gambling platforms. Typically, all you need to use these platforms is a crypto wallet.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do Gambling Tokens Work?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The best gambling token works by using blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient system for conducting transactions on gambling platforms. </p>
<p>Here’s how that looks:</p>
<p>Getting gambling tokens. Users can buy tokens directly from cryptocurrency exchanges and deposit them on the gaming platform via crypto wallets like MetaMask.</p>
<p>Participation in games. Select a game or a sporting event you want to bet on and select the amount of tokens you want to use. Typically you can use a stablecoin like USDT for playing.</p>
<p>Rewards. Some platforms may distribute gambling tokens as bonuses, rewards, or promotions to encourage user participation.</p>
<p>Access to exclusive services. Token owners of that particular casino may get benefits like access to higher wager amounts or VIP events.</p>
<p>Withdrawals. You can withdraw your winnings directly into your crypto wallet without complicated procedures.</p>
<h2><strong>GambleFi vs GameFi</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>While GambleFi and GameFi both operate within the realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency, they serve different purposes. Understanding these differences is crucial to making an informed decision on whether to invest in gambling or gaming tokens.</p>
<h3><strong>They Have Different Utilities</strong></h3>
<p>Gambling tokens, such as Rollbit’s RLB, are specifically designed for use on online gambling platforms. They are used to place bets, enter games and claim rewards within the gambling ecosystem. Some online casinos give voting rights in the DAO to token holders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GameFi coins are used within the broader context of decentralized finance (DeFi) in the gaming industry. They can be used for purchasing in-game assets, for trading at in-game marketplaces, staking and even participating in governance decisions within the DAO. </p>
<p>Some games, like <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/explained-axie-infinity-slp-and-axs-tokens"><u>Axie Infinity, have a dual-token structure: SLP for in-game uses and AXS</u></a> for DAO governance.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332132/axie.jpg" alt="AXS token explained" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Anonymity Features</strong></h3>
<p>Gambling tokens often prioritize user anonymity, which allows individuals to participate in gambling activities without revealing personal or financial information. This is often done directly via a crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Even though blockchain tech gives users anonymity, GameFi coins may or may not prioritize user anonymity, depending on the specific project and its goals. Some games may require only a crypto wallet, while others may require that you sign up with your email or provide additional personal details.</p>
<h3><strong>Value</strong></h3>
<p>The value of gambling tokens depends on the use cases within the gambling platform. Outside of it, they may not have significant value unless the gambling platform grows significantly.</p>
<p>GameFi coins may hold investment value and could potentially appreciate in value based on the success and adoption of the gaming project or platform they are associated with. That’s because a certain in-game asset like a character, weapon or skin, may be rare and more sought after if more players join.</p>
<h2><strong>Advantages of Buying Gambling Tokens</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Buying gambling crypto tokens comes with anonymity, global accessibility, faster and cost-effective transactions, transparency, access to gambling telegram groups and potential rewards.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>The best <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">crypto gambling</a> token comes with rewards for token holders who stake. This means you don’t even have to gamble to benefit from rewards. Some gambling tokens, like Meme Kombat, give you 112% staking APY while you wait for the token to launch.</p>
<p>Other tokens like TG.Casino and Solcasino offer revenue share to the token and NFT holders.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of gambling platforms give rewards to participants, meaning you can earn gambling tokens by participating in the platform’s activities.</p>
<h3><strong>Anonymity and Privacy</strong></h3>
<p>Being an inherent feature of cryptocurrencies, the best gambling cryptocurrency offers anonymity for holders. This means you can engage in gambling activities without revealing your identity.</p>
<p>What’s more, gambling tokens are like any other crypto tokens. All you need is a crypto wallet to store them and that’s it. Even if someone sees the token in your wallet, they wouldn’t necessarily know what kind of token it is. </p>
<h3><strong>Global Accessibility</strong></h3>
<p>Gambling tokens like all cryptocurrencies enable individuals from different parts of the world to participate in online gambling platforms without worrying about currency conversion or international transaction fees.</p>
<p>This makes accessing these platforms seamless and hassle-free. It also opens the potential for more users to come in, which would generate more revenue for the token holders.</p>
<h3><strong>Potential for Appreciation</strong></h3>
<p>Some gambling tokens may also hold investment value, given that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is still in its infancy. Once it goes mainstream and more users flock to the cryptocurrency world, the tokens may appreciate in value.</p>
<p>Given all the advantages of blockchain gambling, this could be easily achieved when macroeconomic factors change.</p>
<h3><strong>Earning ROI From Gambling Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Return on investment (ROI) from gambling tokens involves various strategies such as early investment in a presale, staking rewards, exclusive access and rewards, participation in platform governance, and engaging in gambling activities.</p>
<p>While the potential for earning a substantial ROI exists, you must assess the risks and do your own due diligence before you invest given the volatility and uncertainties inherent in the cryptocurrency and online gambling markets.</p>
<h3><strong>Investment in Presales</strong></h3>
<p>Investing in tokens during their presale phase can potentially offer substantial returns if the platform gains popularity and the demand for the tokens increases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sui"><u>SUI, one of the most popular crypto presales, gained over 7,100%</u></a> after launching on exchanges. This doesn’t mean that every presale will perform the same. In fact, it’s most likely that 90% of the tokens won’t repeat SUI’s success. Which is why it’s important to do your own research before jumping in.</p>
<h3><strong>Staking Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>Some gambling platforms let you earn rewards when you stake your tokens on the platform. The rewards often come from the revenue generated by the gambling platform, which can range from 60 to 100%. But it can rarely come from a separate token pool dedicated for staking rewards.</p>
<p>The latter is often the case with token presales. That’s because some of the presales let you earn more tokens while you wait for the token to launch on exchanges. This gives you even more tokens in your wallet when you decide to sell, which can potentially increase your ROI.</p>
<h3><strong>Exclusive Access and Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>Holding gambling tokens may grant users exclusive access to premium games and services. Some platforms, like Exceedme, give access to higher wager limits to those who stake more coins.</p>
<p>Gambling platforms may offer loyalty rewards and bonuses to token holders, contributing to increased earnings and a higher ROI.</p>
<h3><strong>Engaging in Gambling Activities</strong></h3>
<p>The main utility of gambling tokens is to be used on gambling platforms. You can bet on sporting events or play poker and roulette.</p>
<p>Some gambling platforms may reward users for being active and give out their own tokens. However, unless you’re a professional poker player or an esports gamer, there’s no guarantee that this can increase your ROI in the long run, which is why simply staking your gambling tokens might be the best bang for the buck.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125780/332128/solcas.jpg" alt="Online gambling games" /></figure>
<h2><strong>Are Gambling Tokens Safe?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Gambling tokens offer various security features, such as blockchain technology and anonymity, but they are not without risks. Market volatility, regulatory uncertainty and potential vulnerabilities can affect your holdings.</p>
<p>Blockchain tech is a secure and immutable ledger, which makes transactions secure and transparent. A gambling platform can be hacked, and if your funds are on the platform, they could be exploited. Recently, an Australian <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/04/crypto-casino-stake-targeted-in-reported-40m-exploit/"><u>crypto casino Stake was exploited for $41 million</u></a> with the funds being withdrawn on Ethereum and Polygon networks.</p>
<p>You can avoid this if you frequently withdraw your winnings and tokens from the platform and deposit only when you intend to engage in activities.</p>
<p>However, gambling tokens, similar to all cryptocurrencies, aren’t immune to market volatility. If the sentiment is positive and macroeconomic trends are favorable, gambling tokens along with most cryptocurrencies should trend upward, and vice versa.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>How to Protect Your Crypto Tokens</strong></h3>
<p>Simply buying your gambling tokens doesn’t necessarily mean they can’t be taken from you.</p>
<p>Here’s how to up your game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never share your seed phrase</strong>. Your crypto wallet stores all your coins, not just your gambling tokens. If anyone asks for your seed phrase, they plan to scam you. No one in good fate will ever ask for your seed phrase.</li>
<li><strong>Use a hardware wallet</strong>. Wallets like Trezor and Ledger keep your crypto safe by keeping your seed phrase offline and on the hardware wallet itself. This means that for someone to steal your coins from your hardware wallet, they would need to have the wallet itself and know the PIN number.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t connect your wallet to every link you get</strong>. Scammers typically use links with typos or fake links to legit companies and products. Never connect your wallet and approve transactions unless you are 100% sure it’s legit. As a solution, use a burner wallet. These are wallets where you don’t hold your crypto, and you use it to connect to sites. If it’s a fake site, there won’t be anything to steal from you.</li>
<li><strong>Test with a smaller amount</strong>. In addition to burner wallets, test the links with a small amount. If someone scams you, it would be easier to swallow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Are Gambling Tokens Legal?</strong></h3>
<p>This largely depends on each country and its regulations. In <a href="https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-gambling-tax/"><u>some countries like the UK, Australia and Canada, crypto gambling is legal</u></a>. In others, like China and Qatar, it’s illegal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, within the US, the area of crypto gambling is kind of confusing. There is no legislation on crypto gambling but there is legislation around online gambling. Some <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/crypto-casinos-bitcoin-opened-new-online-gambling-world-rcna23062"><u>states have made online gambling completely legal, while others only allow for sports betting</u></a>. And some states have banned online gambling completely.</p>
<p>This means that globally crypto gambling isn’t regulated, but it’s not prohibited. </p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Avoiding Scams and Fraud</strong></h3>
<p>The crypto space is still plagued by scams and frauds. Even though the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2022-crypto-scam-revenue/"><u>crypto scam revenue dropped 46% in 2022</u></a>, there is still a risk of being scammed in 2023.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/cryptocurrency-scams"><u>most common crypto scams</u></a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pump and dump schemes.</strong> This type of scam was popular in the stock market but as more money started pouring into the crypto world, scammers shifted their focus there. The idea behind <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-to-spot-crypto-pump-and-dump-schemes/"><u>pump and dump</u></a> is that a group of people start pumping the price of a certain cryptocurrency and when new people buy it, they simply dump their tokens and cash out.</li>
<li><strong>Rug pulls. </strong><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/rug-pull"><u>Rug pulls</u></a> are another popular crypto scam where the developers create a token and then remove the token’s liquidity from the pools, leaving investors with tokens that they can’t exchange for anything else.</li>
<li><strong>Giveaway and impersonation scams.</strong> Scammers can hack someone’s social media account and promote a fake giveaway. That happened with <a href="https://decrypt.co/155738/hacker-steals-690000-after-hijacking-vitalik-buterin-x-account"><u>Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin’s Twitter account, which was hacked</u></a> where the hacker posted a fraudulent link to Buterin’s followers promising an exclusive NFT. Everyone who connected their wallets lost their funds, which totaled $690,000. As a rule of thumb, use a burner wallet to connect and mint NFTs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Do You Pay Tax When You Buy Gambling Tokens? </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Gambling tokens are just like any other <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/understanding-crypto-taxes"><u>cryptocurrency when it comes to taxes</u></a>, which means it depends on the country you live in as each country has different rules and regulations.</p>
<p>For example, in the US, buying cryptocurrencies is not a taxable event, meaning you can buy gambling tokens and hold them without paying taxes. Taxes are due when you sell or trade your gambling tokens and recognize a gain, in which case only the profit is taxable. For example, you spend $1,000 on gambling tokens and later sell for a $3,000 profit. You will pay taxes on the $2,000 profit. If you recognize a loss, you can deduct that from your taxes.</p>
<p>However, if you buy one cryptocurrency to buy another, say you buy Ethereum to buy X token, this is considered taxable by the IRS if you sold your Ethereum for more than you bought it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-gambling-tax/"><u>gambling winnings in the UK, Australia and Canada are tax-free</u></a>.</p>
<p>To better understand crypto gambling taxes, consult a professional in your country.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The year 2023 was a significant milestone for the evolution of gambling tokens, especially those offering lucrative rewards. As the industry continues to grow, tokens that offer unique benefits, such as revenue sharing, staking, loyalty bonuses and exclusive access to premium games will likely gain prominence.</p>
<p>Consider gambling token presales as one lucrative investment option as they let you buy the tokens at a discount before launching on exchanges. Stake your coins while you wait for the token launch to increase your holdings.</p>
<p>However, make sure to do thorough research on tokenomics, utility, platform reputation, and regulatory compliance, to make the right investment decision when choosing the best gambling tokens to invest in.</p>
