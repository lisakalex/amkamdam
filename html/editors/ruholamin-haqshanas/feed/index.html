<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, is expected to lose its leading position following the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-us-guilty-plea-may-raise-complications-for-hong-kong-affiliates-crypto-license-application-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">guilty plea to US charges</a> and a record $4.3 billion penalty. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the total market value of cryptocurrencies has surged by 12% or $180 billion in the past week, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>, the platform&#8217;s native token, has missed out on most of the rally, adding only 1.7% to trade at $231 as of Thursday morning in London.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BNB is often seen as a reflection of sentiment towards the exchange since it offers holders benefits such as lower trading fees on Binance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The platform has faced a series of regulatory probes throughout this year, culminating in guilty pleas on November 21 for anti-money laundering and sanctions violations in the United States. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/binance-exchange-s-bnb-token-misses-out-on-180-billion-crypto-rally-1.2008443" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data shows</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that BNB is the only major token that is still nursing a year-to-date loss.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although Binance remains the dominant platform for buying, selling, and trading digital assets and crypto derivatives, its dominance is fading. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to CCData, Binance&#8217;s share of spot trading volumes dropped from 55% at the beginning of 2023 to 32% in November. Its derivatives market share also declined from over 60% to 48%.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We expect Binance will lose its throne as the No. 1 centralized exchange by volumes following the plea deal with US authorities,&#8221; said Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He added that rivals such as OKX, Bybit, Coinbase, and Bitget have the potential to seize the top spot.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New Binance CEO Fails to Address Criticism</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the settlement with US authorities, Binance&#8217;s founder, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty and resigned as CEO.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Richard Teng, a former civil servant turned crypto executive, took over as the new CEO and now faces the challenge of reshaping the company to avoid further regulatory issues while also trying to regain market share.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Teng has emphasized Binance&#8217;s strong revenues and profits, but he is </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-richard-teng-addresses-compliance-issues-in-first-interview.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">under pressure to establish</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a formal headquarters, appoint a board of directors, and provide greater financial transparency for the company.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, explained that Binance&#8217;s recent legal troubles are the reason for BNB&#8217;s underperformance in the market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite recent setbacks, BNB has still outperformed over longer time periods. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It has seen a 700% increase over the past three years, compared to a 121% increase in the index of the top 100 tokens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-says-exchange-has-robust-revenues-and-profits-hinting-at-ability-to-pay-4-3b-fines.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Teng</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has hinted at the exchange’s ability to pay the $4.3 billion it has been fined by the US Justice Department. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The crypto boss has said in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) that the exchange is in good shape financially. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The statement came in reply to a post by Connor Lango, director of business development at Coinbase, who said Binance will most likely be able to “pay full $4.3B DoJ fine with 0 crypto asset sales.”</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed his strong opposition to cryptocurrencies, specifically <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dimon&#8217;s remarks came in response to questioning from Senator Elizabeth Warren, where he claimed that the only true use case for cryptocurrencies is for criminals involved in activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and tax avoidance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He went on to suggest that if he were in government, he would shut down cryptocurrencies altogether.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I&#39;ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc. [Senator Warren] pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals,&quot; says JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. &quot;If I were the government I&#39;d close it down.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/nkEbHR0DOS">pic.twitter.com/nkEbHR0DOS</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dimon&#8217;s comments are not entirely surprising, as he has been a vocal critic of bitcoin and other digital currencies in the past. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He has previously <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/here-he-goes-again-bitcoin-is-hyped-up-fraud-says-jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-but-blockchain-is-deployable.htm">referred to Bitcoin as a &#8220;hyped-up fraud&#8221;</a> and even compared it to a &#8220;pet rock.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite his negative stance on cryptocurrencies, JPMorgan has actively engaged with blockchain technology, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, and has been involved in various blockchain projects.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dimon also found common ground with Senator Warren during the hearing when discussing the need for crypto companies to adhere to the same anti-money laundering regulations as traditional financial institutions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Warren, known for her critical stance on the banking industry, emphasized the importance of national security and preventing terrorists, drug traffickers, and rogue nations from utilizing cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She called on Congress to take action in this regard. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto Accounts for Less Than 1% of Illicit Finance</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The issue of illicit financial activities within the cryptocurrency space has been a topic of contention. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Critics often raise concerns about the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies, citing their use in illegal activities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, recent analysis and statements from industry experts offer a different perspective. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Andrzej Gwizdalski, a lecturer at the University of Western Australia, has shed light on the scale of illicit activities compared to traditional fiat currencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gwizdalski compiled data from reputable sources such as the United Nations, World Economic Forum, and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to compare illicit activities in cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat currencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His findings revealed that the volume of illicit activities in cryptocurrencies is significantly lower than in the traditional financial system. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You have seen bankers advocating shutting down crypto industry because of illicit activities. But let’s look at facts.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime estimates that global money laundering amounts to 2-5% of global GDP, equating to $800 billion to $2 trillion, primarily occurring in fiat currencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the World Economic Forum reports that corruption costs developing countries approximately $1.26 trillion annually, highlighting the prevalence of illegal activities within the traditional financial system.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These insights from industry experts underscore the importance of perspective when discussing illicit financial activities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While cryptocurrencies have been associated with illegal use, the scale of such activities pales in comparison to the traditional fiat system. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is essential to consider the broader context and address the challenges within both systems to ensure effective regulation and prevent illicit activities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Perspective is crucial when addressing illicit financial activities. Traditional fiat, like the USD, is implicated in an estimated $3.2 trillion in illegal activities annually—over 100 times the $20 billion linked to cryptocurrencies, according to UN, WEF, and Chainalysis.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zodia Custody, a crypto custody firm backed by Standard Chartered, has announced the launch of a new product intended to facilitate seamless crypto transfers for institutional investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dubbed &#8220;Interchange Connect,&#8221; the offering aims to create a &#8220;network of networks&#8221; that connects different institutional crypto accounts, allowing for seamless transfer of cryptocurrencies and trade settlements across platforms such as Metaco, Fireblocks, and Copper&#8217;s ClearLoop.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Set to be available to customers in the first quarter of 2024, Interchange Connect aims to simplify the process for institutional investors who need to transfer crypto assets between various accounts. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By providing a secure and reliable solution, Zodia Custody aims to enhance the end-to-end service capabilities for these investors.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As the ecosystem evolves at speed, we move faster to provide comprehensive and global solutions for institutions,&#8221; Zodia Custody&#8217;s Chief Commercial Officer, James Harris, said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Interchange Connect massively opens up the possibilities for institutions by connecting our own bank-grade infrastructure and unique custodial solutions to others, ensuring that institutions gain additional secure, reliable, and compliant end-to-end service capabilities.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Off-Exchange Settlement Gains Traction</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the challenges faced by major crypto businesses like FTX last year, products supporting off-exchange settlement have gained traction.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By integrating with platforms like Copper&#8217;s ClearLoop, companies such as Bitget and Gate.io have already facilitated off-exchange trading and settlement. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zodia Custody&#8217;s Interchange Connect aims to further advance this trend and provide institutions with a secure and efficient means of conducting off-exchange transactions and settlements.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Julian Sawyer, the CEO of Zodia Custody, emphasized the collaborative nature of evolving the digital asset infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;No one party will be solely able to evolve the infrastructure underpinning the digital asset ecosystem — but together, we can provide the tools and services to bring digital assets into the mainstream.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zodia Custody, initially announced by Standard Chartered and Northern Trust in 2021, raised $36 million in April of the same year, with support from SC Ventures (Standard Chartered&#8217;s venture arm), SBI Holdings, and other undisclosed investors. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zodia Integrates Ripple-Owned Metaco’s Crypto Safekeeping</span></h2>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this week, Zodia Custody </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-zodia-integrates-ripple-owned-metacos-crypto-safekeeping.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said it has integrated Metaco network’s</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> global crypto storage services to offer sub-custody services for cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This means that Metaco would store client’s funds and provide means to manage them including initiating transfers via web interface.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zodia’s partnership aims to expand its services and reach a wider audience by providing safekeeping and settlement of digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The integration came a month after Zodia Custody </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-crypto-firm-zodia-launches-in-hong-kong.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">expanded its services in Hong Kong</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in response to institutional demand. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At a recent debate held at the University of Alabama, Republican candidates gathered to discuss various topics, including cryptocurrency regulation and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the event, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis criticized the idea of a central bank digital currency and pledged to discard it if he were elected president. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He took the opportunity to express his staunch opposition to CBDC, portraying President Biden&#8217;s support for such a currency as a direct assault on personal freedoms, including privacy and unregulated purchasing power.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DeSantis argued that implementing CBDC would eliminate the use of cash and force individuals to rely solely on digital transactions, thereby jeopardizing privacy and enabling excessive regulation of purchases. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;They’ll take away your privacy, they will absolutely regulate your purchases. On day one as President, we take the idea of central bank digital currency, and we throw it in the trash can. It’ll be dead on arrival.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The debate stage featured prominent political figures, including former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably absent was former President Donald Trump, who opted to attend a fundraiser in Florida instead.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DeSantis Banned CBDCs in Florida</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported, DeSantis has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cbdcs-banned-florida-as-governor-ron-desantis-signs-new-bill.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">signed a bill banning CBDCs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the state of Florida.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He has highlighted concerns about the potential use of CBDCs to control and surveil Americans, adding that the government could use CBDCs to stop people from buying gas to combat global warming or track how often someone purchases firearms. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Anyone with their eyes open could see the danger this type of an arrangement would mean for Americans who want to exercise their financial independence and would like to be able to conduct business without having the government know every single transaction they’re making in real time.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/surveys-reveal-strong-cbdc-skepticism-canada-uk.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">studies conducted by Trezor and WealthRocket</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, people in both Canada and the UK have reservations about embracing CBDCs as an alternative to cash. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approximately 39% of the 1,500 Canadians </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.wealthrocket.com/survey-central-bank-digital-currency-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">surveyed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by WealthRocket expressed concerns about losing control over their finances if CBDCs were implemented. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many individuals fear that granting the government unilateral control over their money may compromise their financial autonomy. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ramaswamy Criticizes Regulatory Framework in the US</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vivek Ramaswamy, another presidential candidate who joined the discussion, criticized the existing regulatory framework as ineffective. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He pointed to the recent controversy involving Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and his company FTX as evidence of regulatory shortcomings. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ramaswamy emphasized the need for regulations to keep up with the evolving landscape of fraud, criminal activities, and terrorism.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Our regulations need to catch up with the current moment. The fact that SBF was able to do what he did at FTX shows that whatever they have in the current framework isn’t working.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ramaswamy further expressed his disappointment in SEC Chairman Gary Gensler&#8217;s inability to confidently classify Ethereum during his congressional testimony. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He deemed it embarrassing that the leader of the SEC could not definitively determine whether Ethereum should be considered a regulated security or not. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The people who we elect to run the government are not the ones who are even actually running the government. It is the bureaucrats in those three-letter agencies,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Robinhood is expanding its services in the European Union (EU) by launching commission-free crypto trading. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move comes just a week after the company made its international debut with stock-broking services in the UK. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Robinhood app, set to go live on Thursday, will enable European investors to buy and sell over 25 cryptocurrencies, including popular options like Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana&#8217;s SOL, Johann Kerbrat, the general manager of Robinhood Crypto, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-07/robinhood-hood-launches-zero-fee-crypto-trading-app-in-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">told Bloomberg</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Robinhood to Introduce Loyalty Program</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">To further incentivize users, Robinhood will introduce a loyalty program that functions similarly to cashback. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A percentage of each user&#8217;s monthly trading volume will be credited in the form of Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The launch of the app coincides with a recovery in crypto prices, driven by expectations of potential US interest-rate hikes being reversed and the industry potentially witnessing the introduction of the first exchange-traded fund directly tied to Bitcoin as early as next month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In November, Robinhood reported a 75% increase in notional trading volumes for crypto compared to the previous month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, Robinhood currently has no immediate plans to offer its crypto services to UK investors, citing a lack of regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets in the country. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The revenue generated by Robinhood&#8217;s crypto brokerage will come from rebates received from market makers and trading venues executing trades on its behalf. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In Europe, the rebate will be approximately &#8220;65 basis points&#8221; per trade, nearly double the 35 basis points earned from crypto orders executed in the US.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Trading Volumes Remain Low Despite Price Surges</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the rise in crypto prices this year, trading volumes have remained relatively low compared to the retail investor surge witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This subdued enthusiasm has impacted Robinhood&#8217;s overall performance, with the company experiencing a decline in third-quarter revenue, primarily due to a 55% drop in crypto trading volumes compared to the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In its home market, Robinhood currently offers around 15 tokens. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the company had to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/robinhood-delists-cardano-polygon-solana-following-sec-labeling-them-as-securities.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">remove several coins</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, including SOL and Polygon&#8217;s MATIC, from its offering in response to the US Securities and Exchange Commission categorizing them as unregistered securities in June. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulatory crackdown has prompted major US crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini to expand their operations overseas.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For the time being, European customers using Robinhood Crypto will not be able to transfer their crypto holdings outside of the app. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevertheless, the company plans to introduce this feature next year, along with additional tokens and staking services. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Robinhood has been registered as a virtual currency exchange operator in Lithuania since September and is actively pursuing approvals in more EU countries. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once the EU&#8217;s new Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regime comes into effect in early 2025, Robinhood will be required to obtain full authorization as a crypto service provider in at least one EU member state.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> has displayed resilience by surging to a more than 19-month high, even as global markets experienced a downturn. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency climbed 5.8% to reach $42,000 on Monday and maintained its position just below that level in morning Asian trading on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In contrast, global shares and bonds have been struggling with losses since the beginning of the week. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This divergence highlights the current low correlation between cryptocurrencies and other traditional macro assets, Sean Farrell, the head of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-05/bitcoin-btc-price-holds-near-42-000-as-rally-weathers-drop-in-stocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">told Bloomberg</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Throughout 2023, Bitcoin&#8217;s correlations with stocks and gold have diminished as specific factors within the crypto market propelled a remarkable 152% surge in the value of the largest digital asset. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the key drivers behind the gains is the anticipation that the United States will approve its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), potentially expanding the demand for the token.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and MSCI Inc.&#8217;s global shares index has declined from 0.60 to 0.18 since the start of the year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A similar analysis of the token and spot gold reveals that the correlation figure has dropped close to zero from 0.36. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates assets moving in tandem, while minus-1 signifies opposite movements.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regulation Impacts Crypto Market in the US</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regulation is another significant factor that has influenced the crypto market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Executives in the industry are becoming increasingly optimistic that the worst of the US crackdown on the sector is behind them. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recent events, such as the imprisonment of Sam Bankman-Fried for fraud at FTX and the hefty fines imposed on top crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao for US anti-money-laundering and sanctions violations, have instilled the belief that US authorities and regulators have already expressed their stance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This has raised hopes for more constructive dialogues between regulators and industry participants.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that technical indicators, including the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), suggest that Bitcoin&#8217;s rally may have become overextended, with the index at 75 above the 70 overbought level.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, speculative interest persists due to predictions of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission granting approval for US spot Bitcoin ETFs by January. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, investors have taken encouragement from bets on future interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Online brokerage Robinhood Markets reported in a Monday filing that its notional crypto trading volumes in November were approximately 75% higher than October levels. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Likewise, shares of public crypto companies listed in the US </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-microstrategy-shares-surge-as-bitcoin-resumes-rally.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">have experienced a surge</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> amid soaring BTC price.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Monday, popular crypto exchange </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> saw a 7.3% surge before the market opened. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite reporting a decline in third-quarter trading volumes, the stock enjoyed a remarkable increase of nearly 62% in November.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Microstrategy, a prominent bitcoin investor that acquired bitcoins worth $593 million the previous month, also experienced an 8.2% gain.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Richard Teng</strong>, the newly appointed CEO of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>, has faced a challenging debut during his first public interview. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In an interview at the Financial Times&#8217; Crypto and Digital Assets Summit in London, the crypto boss acknowledged that Binance&#8217;s compliance systems had been inadequate in the past, admitting to mistakes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, Teng, who has held senior positions at Binance for several years, avoided giving direct answers about the company&#8217;s governance.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the interview, conducted remotely via video with moderator Scott Chipolina, The Financial Times&#8217; digital assets correspondent, Teng evaded straightforward questions about Binance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Chipolina repeatedly asked about Binance&#8217;s global headquarters, the possibility of an audit, the number of employees, and the company&#8217;s application for a license in the UK. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Teng seemed unwilling to provide clear answers, frustrating Chipolina.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I&#8217;ve asked you where Binance&#8217;s global headquarters is, I&#8217;ve asked you whether Binance is going to undergo an audit, how many employees the company currently has on its books and whether you&#8217;re applying for a license in the UK, which is what Binance told us during our last FT crypto conference. You haven&#8217;t answered those questions.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Teng, seemingly losing patience, insisted that he had answered each question. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, when asked once again about Binance&#8217;s headquarters, he responded, &#8220;It is under consideration.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even when questioned about the future of Binance and the changes the company would undergo under new leadership, Teng remained vague, stating that &#8220;a lot of things will change&#8221; before diverting to a discussion about the industry landscape.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Teng Succeeded CZ Following DOJ </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Settlement</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Teng assumed the position of CEO a few weeks ago, succeeding Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao following the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The exchange had been accused of violating sanctions and money-transmitting laws. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In his interview, Teng began with a prepared statement, admitting that mistakes had been made and acknowledging the inadequacy of Binance&#8217;s compliance control given its size. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He stated that going forward, the exchange aims to be both &#8220;user-led&#8221; and &#8220;compliance-led.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When pressed about the possibility of an audit, Teng claimed that as a private company not raising funds publicly, Binance is not obligated to disclose such information.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He mentioned that the auditors possess the necessary details but avoided naming a specific auditor when asked. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-binance-ceo-says-exchange-has-robust-revenues-and-profits-hinting-at-ability-to-pay-4-3b-fines.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Teng </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has hinted at the exchange’s ability to pay the $4.3 billion it has been fined by the US Justice Department. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Teng, who was named CEO of Binance on Tuesday after Changpeng Zhao stepped down, said in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) that the exchange is in good shape financially. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The statement came in reply to a post by Connor Lango, director of business development at Coinbase, who said Binance will most likely be able to “pay full $4.3B DoJ fine with 0 crypto asset sales.”</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr has proposed a bug fix to potentially alleviate the network congestion caused by new Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Dashjr claimed that these tokens are taking advantage of a vulnerability within the Bitcoin Core code, resulting in an influx of transactions that &#8220;spam the blockchain.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA: “Inscriptions” are exploiting a vulnerability in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> Core to spam the blockchain. Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code,…</p>
<p>&mdash; Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1732204937466032285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dashjr explained that the Bitcoin Core code has featured the ability for users to set limits on the size of additional data in transactions since 2013. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, by disguising their data as program code, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-nfts-how-ordinals-proved-bitcoin-can-evolve-with-times.htm">inscriptions used by Ordinals</a> and BRC-20 creators can bypass this limit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The bug allowing inscriptions to surpass the data size limit has recently been addressed in the latest update to Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin Core derivative that incorporates features backported from the core code.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No More Ordinals or BRC-20 Tokens</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Responding to a question on social media regarding the future of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens once the vulnerability is fixed, Dashjr confirmed that these tokens would no longer be viable. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, existing inscriptions would remain intact. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He expressed concern that the vulnerability persists in the upcoming v26 release of Bitcoin Core, hoping that it would be resolved before the v27 release next year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ocean, a decentralized mining protocol where Dashjr serves as the chief technology officer, also acknowledged the significance of the Bitcoin Knots upgrade. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a statement on social media, Ocean emphasized that the upgrade would rectify a long-standing vulnerability exploited by modern spammers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, the protocol anticipates including more genuine transactions in its blocks and considers Ordinals inscriptions as a form of denial-of-service attack on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> network.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are happy to announce testing of Bitcoin Knots v25.1 has completed successfully, and is now deployed to production. Among other improvements, this upgrade fixes this long-standing vulnerability exploited by modern spammers. As a result, our blocks will now include many more… <a href="https://t.co/II3y0B6Pu4">https://t.co/II3y0B6Pu4</a></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dashjr Remains Big Critic of Ordinals</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dashjr has been a vocal critic of Ordinals inscriptions, asserting that the damage caused to Bitcoin and its users, including future users, is substantial and irreversible. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He claimed that Ordinals were never authorized and have been an attack on Bitcoin since their inception.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Ordinals protocol, developed by Casey Rodarmor in January 2023, allows users to engrave data and non-fungible tokens onto satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In recent days, the Bitcoin network has experienced heightened congestion due to the influx of inscriptions and the minting of BRC-20 tokens. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With over 275,000 unconfirmed transactions, the network is grappling with increased congestion and rising medium-priority transaction costs, which have surged from approximately $1.50 to around $14, according to data from mempool.space.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that Ordinals sparked some controversy within the community in the very early days. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin purists have been critical of the Ordinals project, arguing that it could price out the actual financial activity and thus damage Bitcoin’s image as a reliable P2P payments network. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, supporters of the protocol have claimed that it can attract more people and extend the Bitcoin network’s use cases. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Per the report, HKMA Chief Executive Yu Weiman disclosed plans for the upcoming &#8220;Green Finance Week&#8221; in February 2024. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The event aims to facilitate discussions on green financial transformation, with a primary focus on organizing a global climate business forum in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation under the World Bank. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Weiman emphasized the intention to strengthen Hong Kong&#8217;s green brand on a global scale during Green Finance Week. </span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regarding the issuance of the second tokenized green bond, Yu Weiman underscored the symbiotic relationship between green finance and financial technology. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The HKMA is actively exploring methods to conduct the redemption process within the blockchain ecosystem, aiming to enhance operational efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the HKMA is studying the integration of blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) for tokenized green bonds. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This integration will enable bondholders to gain comprehensive insights into the green projects they invest in, track their development progress, and understand the environmental impact, thereby reducing the chances of &#8220;greenwashing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Weiman also mentioned the significant growth of Hong Kong&#8217;s green bonds and green loans, which surged to approximately US$80 billion (around HK$625.2 billion) from a mere US$11 billion just two years ago. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He expressed confidence in the continued momentum of green finance, emphasizing that there is still ample room for further expansion.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> has gained more than 10% over the past day as the cryptocurrency celebrates its tenth anniversary, marking a decade since its inception. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the time of writing, the popular meme coin is trading at $0.09909, up by 10% over the past 24 hours, according to data by CoinMarketCap. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With its iconic Shiba-Inu logo, Dogecoin has captured the hearts and imaginations of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent uptick in its value has not only brought joy to its holders but has also attracted attention to the increasing activities of whale transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These transactions, involving large-wallet investors with holdings exceeding $100,000, have surged in the past week, further contributing to the rise in DOGE&#8217;s price.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Was Dogecoin Created?</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dogecoin was created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The idea behind Dogecoin emerged from an online conversation between the two in late 2013, during the height of the cryptocurrency boom. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inspired by the popular &#8220;Doge&#8221; internet meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, Markus and Palmer decided to create a cryptocurrency that would be fun and accessible to a wider audience.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Markus, a programmer from Portland, Oregon, took the lead in developing the technical aspects of Dogecoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He used the existing codebase of another cryptocurrency called Luckycoin, which itself was a fork of Litecoin, a well-established cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By modifying the code and incorporating the Doge meme theme, Markus was able to create the initial version of Dogecoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On December 6, 2013, Dogecoin was officially launched to the public. The timing of its release coincided with the peak of the cryptocurrency frenzy, which helped generate significant attention and interest in the new coin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The friendly and welcoming nature of the Dogecoin community, along with its philanthropic endeavors, quickly attracted a dedicated following.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin was not created with the intention of being a serious investment or a rival to Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instead, its creators aimed to create a digital currency that would bring joy and laughter to its users while maintaining the core principles of decentralization and blockchain technology.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Elon Musk&#8217;s Support of Dogecoin</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Musk has become a prominent figure in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to meme coins. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His tweets and public statements have wielded significant influence over the market, often leading to dramatic price fluctuations and capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Musk’s connection with meme coins can be traced back to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-elon-musks-doge-1-moon-mission-launch-approaches-will-doge-reach-1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">his fondness for Dogecoin</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The billionaire has previously endorsed Dogecoin in numerous tweets, which has consistently sparked excitement and speculation among traders.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His endorsement of the cryptocurrency has even led to the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elon-musks-verbal-outburst-sparks-surge-in-gfy-meme-coins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">creation of other meme coins</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> inspired by his persona.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, the billionaire has even been </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elon-musk-eyes-twitter-digital-payments-expansion-but-faces-doge-pyramid-legal-wrap.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for $258 billion for influencing the price of Dogecoin with his tweets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Filed by plaintiff Keith Johnson in New York in June last year, the lawsuit accuses Musk and his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, of running a “pyramid scheme” to inflate the price of the meme coin.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency industry has spent a staggering $18.96 million in federal lobbying in the first three quarters of 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The figure surpasses the $16.1 million spent during the same period in 2022, Reuters </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-crypto-industry-lobby-spending-track-new-record-2023-2023-12-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, citing data from nonprofit research group OpenSecrets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The record-breaking spending occurred despite the high-profile collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year, which had previously ranked among the top ten lobbying spenders. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2022, crypto companies, including FTX, collectively invested nearly $22 million in lobbying efforts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Leading the pack once again is Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, which spent $2.16 million on lobbying. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other prominent spenders include Foris DAX, the operator of Crypto.com, the Blockchain Association, and Binance Holdings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our goal is to engage directly with policymakers, build relationships, and bridge the education gap to build a commonsense regulatory framework,&#8221; said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency companies&#8217; increased presence in Washington reflects their efforts to mend their reputations following a series of scandals that unfolded last year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One notable incident was the collapse of FTX, whose former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, had been a familiar figure in Washington. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried was recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/disgraced-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-friend-found-guilty-on-all-seven-fraud-charges.htm">found guilty of fraud</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to reputation management, crypto firms are grappling with mounting regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which accuses the industry of non-compliance with its rules. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC&#8217;s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance in June, alleging failure to register tokens, have become focal points for the industry&#8217;s lobbying efforts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the cryptocurrency industry has been advocating for the SEC&#8217;s approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Such approval would open doors for millions of new investors to access the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Optimism surrounding this possibility, fueled by the SEC&#8217;s loss in a key court battle over the matter in the summer, propelled Bitcoin to a 20-month high recently.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto Companies Work to Advance Crypto Bills</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto companies have also been working to advance legislation in the House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In July, they celebrated a victory as a congressional committee passed two significant bills. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These bills aim to provide clarity on which existing financial regulations apply to crypto companies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although further progress is required for these bills to become law, crypto lobbyists remain steadfast in their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase, which launched a grassroots advocacy campaign in September, continues to push for its cause with scheduled meetings with lawmakers in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In August, the platform also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-exchange-launches-stand-with-crypto-alliance-an-independent-pro-crypto-advocacy-group.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">launched a crypto advocacy group</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> tasked with promoting the interests of the crypto community. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges based in the United States, has highlighted the importance of stablecoins in facilitating seamless transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent blog post, the San Francisco-headquartered exchange noted that many Americans are frustrated when dealing with the traditional financial system.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It argued that stablecoins offer a solution by providing &#8220;all the benefits of cash without the drawbacks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a stakeholder in Circle, the issuer of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/">USD Coin (USDC)</a> stablecoin, Coinbase asserted that physical cash no longer meets the expectations of digitally savvy consumers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interbank transfers can take days, while stablecoin alternatives in the crypto space are faster and more cost-effective. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;There are reasons why physical cash has been so popular for so long. It’s private; stays stable in times of economic volatility; and supports instant payments person-to-person,&#8221; the exchange wrote. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;These are strong upsides that we want to carry forward in payment systems of the future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, regulatory barriers are hindering the United States from becoming a true &#8220;crypto hub.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In contrast, countries such as Nigeria and Brazil are actively promoting stablecoin and cryptocurrency adoption on a global scale.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To address this issue, Coinbase emphasized the urgent need for clear and sensible regulations governing stablecoins. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The exchange said that such regulations are necessary to prevent the United States from falling behind in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the platform did not provide specific suggestions regarding stablecoin regulation, it called on the crypto community to engage with members of Congress and support legislation that enables stablecoins while ensuring consumer protection. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase also encouraged individuals to join communities advocating for comprehensive crypto regulations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite their potential, stablecoins still face liquidity risks in extreme circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In March 2023, reports emerged that Coinbase extended a $3 billion credit line to Circle in an effort to restore the USDC stablecoin&#8217;s peg to the US dollar. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This credit line was provided after USDC deviated from its intended value due to Circle&#8217;s exposure of $3.3 billion to Silicon Valley Bank, which was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation following a bank run.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase Expands Global Presence Despite Regulatory Hurdles</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase has been actively expanding its global presence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in September, the exchange revealed that it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-becomes-registered-crypto-exchange-spain.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">secured</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> compliance registration from the </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bank of Spain</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, making it a registered crypto exchange in the country.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The registration with the Bank of Spain allows Coinbase to offer its full suite of products and services to both retail and institutional users in Spain while ensuring compliance with the country’s legal framework.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past year, Coinbase has obtained Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registrations in several European countries, including Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It has also received in-principle approval and launched its services in Singapore, Brazil, and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company’s push for global expansion comes amid growing regulatory hostility in the US.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent surge in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> price could be the beginning of a new crypto supercycle that propels the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency to an astonishing $500,000. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enthusiasts believe that the recent surge in BTC price, which saw the leading cryptocurrency surpass $42,000, is indicative of a new monetary order that is captivating Wall Street and the digital-assets community, according to a Monday </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-04/bitcoin-btc-hype-machine-goes-into-overdrive-as-token-surges-past-42-000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report from Bloomberg</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The excitement surrounding Bitcoin&#8217;s rally has fueled optimistic predictions about its future gains. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The prophecies for how high the coin could go spanned anywhere from $50,000 in the immediate term, to above $530,000, the report noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;It’s getting crazy again. Those kinds of comments show just how quickly sentiment can change for this asset class,&#8221; said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I would argue that one of the most important reasons Bitcoin rallied so strongly in 2020 and 2021 was because of the massive influx of liquidity into the system due to the pandemic. Without another huge liquidity program, some of those predictions are a pipe dream.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Market Participants Wait for ETF Approval</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable revival in 2023, gaining over 150% so far this year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Market-watchers are eagerly anticipating the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-decision-dates-approach-what-to-expect-in-january.htm">approval of a Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> in the United States, which could bring billions of dollars of new investments into the space.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The prospect of a BTC ETF has generated significant institutional enthusiasm and contributed to the shifting market dynamics observed since mid-October. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Kaiko researchers, there has been a rise in crypto investment products and an uptick in daily spot-trading volumes, reaching a seven-month high in November. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They claimed that the hope for a BTC ETF approval, combined with an improving macro environment, has fueled the recent market momentum.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While excitement about a broader crypto rally is spreading across social media platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), it&#8217;s important to exercise caution. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin has experienced multiple hype cycles in recent years, with gains celebrated even as the coin continues to climb toward its 2021 all-time high of approximately $69,000. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Past runs have ended with significant drops, as seen in the 64% decline in 2022 following a 60% gain in 2021.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Skeptics Remain Despite Soaring Prices</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the potential approval of a BTC ETF and the anticipation of interest rate cuts have fueled speculative frenzy, skepticism remains. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Michael O&#8217;Rourke, the chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said that those who missed out on the $20,000 rally might not be willing to pay double for Bitcoin simply because it is associated with an ETF. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He claimed that Bitcoin, in its 14-year existence, has primarily served as a speculative investment rather than demonstrating significant utility.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The asset is purely speculative gambling and in the 14 years it has been around, it has not exhibited any true utility other than speculation and illicit money transfer.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the CMS license, DigiFT has also been recognized by MAS as a market operator, granting the exchange the ability to operate an organized market for secondary trading of security tokens on the public blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Securing both the CMS licence and RMO recognition is a significant milestone in our journey to enable regulated access to financial opportunities on-chain,&#8221; Henry Zhang, founder and CEO of DigiFT, said in a comment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As the first exchange on the public blockchain to use an AMM mechanism for secondary trading, we will continue to unlock innovations, as a RMO, in the intersection of finance and blockchain technology, including the tokenisation of real-world assets.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tether&#8217;s decision to bolster its Bitcoin reserves is aimed at diversifying its holdings beyond cash and cash equivalents. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By holding BTC and other assets, Tether aims to protect its reserves from the loss of purchasing power during prolonged cryptocurrency market downturns.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shares of public crypto companies listed in the US experienced a surge on Monday as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> surpassed $42,000, reaching a new high for the year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Popular crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> saw a 7.3% surge before the market opened. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite reporting a decline in third-quarter trading volumes, the stock enjoyed a remarkable increase of nearly 62% in November.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Microstrategy, a prominent bitcoin investor that acquired bitcoins worth $593 million the previous month, also experienced an 8.2% gain.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin mining companies such as Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, and CleanSpark saw impressive jumps of 9.7% to 12.0%, respectively, adding to their double-digit gains from November.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which tracks bitcoin futures, rose by 7.4% and appeared poised to reach a one-year high. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conversely, the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which allows traders to bet on a decline in bitcoin futures, experienced a 7.2% decrease.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Surges Above $42,000 Amid ETF Optimism</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, climbed 4.0% to $41,598.0, marking its highest point since April 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The surge was fueled by enthusiasm surrounding potential interest rate cuts in the US and traders speculating on the imminent approval of stock market-traded Bitcoin funds.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the trading session, bitcoin reached a peak of $42,162, capturing the attention of investors and traders alike. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is expected to have a significant impact on investment appetite, as it would provide easier regulation, increased appeal, and simplified investment processes, according to Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;What we have right now is a risk rally, and bitcoin is also benefiting big time by falling yields,&#8221; Ozkardeskaya said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;There is also this positive bullish sentiment into next year because it is going to be the year of halving.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Historical trends have shown that bitcoin prices tend to rally following halvings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this year, investor sentiment toward cryptocurrencies and related assets was lukewarm due to high-profile collapses in 2022, leading to significant outflows from the sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the recent rally has propelled bitcoin&#8217;s value up by over 150% in 2023, positioning it for its best annual performance since 2020.</span></p>

<p>&mdash; Mantle (@0xMantle) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMantle/status/1731616193684165026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The introduction of the staking service represents Mantle&#8217;s expansion following the deployment of its Layer 2 network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The concept of liquid staking, which enables users to free up their capital from staked assets, has gained popularity on Ethereum. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, this has resulted in a concentration of ETH stakes with major providers like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mantle aims to address this issue by offering a wider range of solutions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The protocol originated from a proposal in the Mantle governance forum in July 2023 and has since undergone an alpha phase in October, followed by a permissionless phase to broaden access and participation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the launch of Mantle LSP, users can stake ether and receive Mantle-staked ether (mETH) as a token representing their stake.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The concentration of ETH staking is a result of network effect through a feedback loop of increasing name recognition and use case,” said Jordi Alexander, Chief Alchemist at Mantle. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“By focusing on mETH’s adoption in LSDfi both in the Mantle ecosystem and beyond, and its capital efficiency in maintaining the highest sustainable yield, Mantle LSP intends to be a part of the solution by creating more options for users.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since merging with BitDAO in May 2023, Mantle has accumulated one of the most significant community treasuries in the cryptocurrency space. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to DeepDAO, its treasury includes assets worth $470 million in ether and over $200 million in stablecoins.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buterin Expresses Concern About Staking Concentration</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also joined the cult of those voicing concer regarding the concentration of power among Ethereum’s liquid staking providers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lido, a prominent liquid staking pool, currently controls over 32% of the staked ether on Ethereum, with holdings distributed across different validators. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alongside Rocket Pool, Lido is a significant player in the ecosystem, but Buterin highlighted the need for more robust safety mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buterin proposed exploring additional solutions to enhance the safety and decentralization of liquid staking. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-ethereum-staking-providers-promise-not-own-more-than-22-of-validators.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of Ethereum.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rocket Pool</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">StakeWise</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stader Labs</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Diva Staking</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Puffer Finance</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit rule.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lido Finance</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> has decided not to commit to the self-limit rule.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in June, the project put forward a proposal to impose a limit on Lido’s maximum stake.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Less than one half of one percent of the votes cast were in favor of the self-limit rule, while those holding more than 99% of Lido’s governance tokens, LDO, voted for the protocol to not hold back on its growth.</span></p>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the second-largest staking provider, holds only an 8.7% market share, according to data from Dune Analytics.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Three out of every four </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/16-best-crypto-games-to-play-in-cur_year.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Web3 games</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> launched in the past five years have met their demise, presenting a bleak outlook for GameFi industry. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-gamefi-dead?utm_campaign=Data%2BVisualization&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, CoinGecko analyzed the launch and success rates of 2,817 games between 2018 and 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shockingly, only 690 games managed to maintain a somewhat active player base, while a staggering 2,100 games have ceased operations, which translates to an alarming annual failure rate of 80.8% for Web3 games during this period. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The failure rate was calculated by comparing the number of failed games to the total number of games launched.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CoinGecko defines a failed Web3 game as one that experiences a 99% drop in active users based on a 14-day moving average from its peak. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The discouraging outlook is surprising considering the initial acclaim Web3 gaming received within the crypto community, offering users the ability to earn substantial rewards and tangible value from their gaming experiences. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The sector has also attracted significant interest and investments in the crypto space.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even in the current year, Web3 gaming projects have secured over $2 billion in funding. However, the CoinGecko report casts doubt on the sustainability of the industry.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2022 Saw Highest Failure Rate in GameFi</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2021, the highest number of blockchain games were launched in a single year, totaling 738. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, during the 2022 bear market, Web3 gaming faced challenging circumstances, resuling in the highest failure rate, with 742 games unable to sustain themselves. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More specifically, the failure rate for Web3 games reached 107% last year as a record-high 742 games shut down.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The failure rates for Web3 games in 2019 and 2020 were at a staggering 95%, while 2021 experienced the lowest failure rate at 45%.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report noted the impact of the bear market on GameFi development and interest, with only 244 Web3 games launched between 2019 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During this period, the failure rate rose to 94.3% in 2019 and remained at 94.2% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Surprisingly, despite the number of failed games increasing to 339 in 2021, it recorded the lowest failure rate due to the crypto bull run.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">509 Web3 Games Have Ceased Operations in 2023</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">So far this year, 509 Web3 games have already ceased operations, resulting in a 70% failure rate. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although this marks a lower failure rate compared to 2022, it suggests a potential stabilization in the GameFi and Web3 gaming industry, potentially attributed to the recent market recovery and signs of a bullish trend.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that some of the more prominent Web3 games have also suffered a major setback. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While CryptoKitties, launched in 2017, initially generated significant interest as the first Web3 game, its adoption has since slowed. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, prominent Web3 games like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Axie Infinity have emerged and solidified their position in the market.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A French court has acquitted the individuals accused of orchestrating the $8.5 million hack on Platypus Finance, an automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Avalanche blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/12/01/piratage-de-la-plate-forme-de-cryptomonnaies-platypus-les-deux-accuses-relaxes-par-la-justice_6203417_4408996.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report by Le Monde</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the defendants, identified as Mohammed and Benamar M., were arrested shortly after the attack, thanks to the assistance of crypto investigator ZachXBT and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 22-year-old Mohammed faced charges related to the cyberattack, while his brother was accused of receiving stolen goods. Prosecutors had sought a five-year prison sentence for Mohammed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the trial, Mohammed claimed to be an &#8220;ethical hacker&#8221; who planned to return the stolen funds to the protocol, hoping to receive a 10% bonus. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, due to an error during the flash loan attack, he inadvertently locked away a significant portion of the stolen funds, managing to recover only around $270,000. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a counter-hack, Platypus was able to salvage $2.4 million in USDC.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Court Dismisses Charges of Unauthorized Access</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The court ruled that since the smart contract used by Mohammed was publicly accessible, charges of unauthorized access to a computer system did not apply. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the court deemed Mohammed&#8217;s use of Platypus&#8217;s &#8220;emergency withdrawal&#8221; smart contract, which had the vulnerability he exploited, as not constituting fraud.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, the charges related to money laundering and receiving stolen goods were also dropped. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the court reminded the brothers that Platypus could still pursue legal action against them in civil court. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The judges made it clear that the acquittal did not grant them unrestricted immunity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in October, Platypus Finance </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-protocol-platypus-finance-hacked-for-over-2-million-avalanche-heres-what-happened.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">fell victim to a security breach</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> resulting in the loss of over $2 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attack was executed through a flash loan attack, specifically targeting the AVAX-sAVAX liquidity pool.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flash loans are a feature in decentralized finance that enables users to borrow assets without providing collateral, as long as the loan is repaid within the same transaction block. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unfortunately, attackers have found ways to exploit this mechanism, manipulating market prices or exploiting vulnerabilities within DeFi protocols. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By borrowing substantial sums, attackers can artificially create market conditions, taking advantage of the resulting discrepancies for profit before repaying the loan, all within a single transaction block.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Long Way Before Crypto is Safe</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">While crypto security is without a doubt a critical concern, the industry is still in its early stages when it comes to protecting digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“With numerous hacks and exploits occurring, it’s evident that there’s a lot of work to be done to make the field safer,” Sipan Vardanyan, CEO and Co-Founder at crypto security firm Hexens, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/theres-long-way-ahead-make-crypto-safer-hexens-ceo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said in a recent interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with Cryptonews.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So far this year, Web3 platforms have </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-loses-12-billion-hacks-rug-pulls-so-far-2023-report.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">lost over $1.2 billion</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in hacks and rug pulls, according to a report from Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report revealed a total of 211 separate incidents contributing to this massive sum, with the month of August alone accounting for $23.4 million in losses.</span></p>
