<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the CMS license, DigiFT has also been recognized by MAS as a market operator, granting the exchange the ability to operate an organized market for secondary trading of security tokens on the public blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Securing both the CMS licence and RMO recognition is a significant milestone in our journey to enable regulated access to financial opportunities on-chain,&#8221; Henry Zhang, founder and CEO of DigiFT, said in a comment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As the first exchange on the public blockchain to use an AMM mechanism for secondary trading, we will continue to unlock innovations, as a RMO, in the intersection of finance and blockchain technology, including the tokenisation of real-world assets.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DigiFT Offers Secondary Trading for Security Tokens</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">DigiFT&#8217;s platform, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain, offers secondary trading liquidity for security tokens through an automatic market-making mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tokens traded on DigiFT are backed by real-world assets such as bonds, equities, and collective investment schemes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the CMS license in place, DigiFT plans to introduce a wider range of tokenized real-world assets and Web3 assets, further expanding its offerings to users.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Established in 2021, DigiFT is the first and only decentralized exchange with an automatic market-making mechanism to be enrolled in the MAS fintech regulatory sandbox. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This regulatory sandbox allows innovative fintech companies to test their solutions in a controlled environment, fostering technological advancements in the financial industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Looking ahead, DigiFT aims to expand its app&#8217;s availability in different regions while enhancing the user experience by introducing more user-friendly features. </span></p>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Singapore has been actively engaging with global financial authorities in the realm of digital currencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In September 2023, MAS successfully completed a joint test of cross-border trading and settlement of wholesale central bank digital currencies in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements and the central banks of France and Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in July, Singapore </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-plans-safeguard-cryptocurrency-investments-with-new-trust-requirement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">also revealed plans</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to impose a trust requirement on cryptocurrency exchanges in a bid to instill confidence in the market and protect investors from potential losses.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the time, the MAS stated that cryptocurrency exchanges would be required to keep customer assets in a trust.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new regulation is expected to be implemented before the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, Singapore will proceed with its proposal to ban lending and staking for retail investors.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MAS </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-may-introduce-risk-test-before-permitting-cryptocurrency-trading.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">initiated a consultation on these measures</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in October last year, just before </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the FTX debacle</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The aim of the consultation was to enhance Singapore’s regulatory framework for digital assets.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to data accumulated by crypto analyst EmberCN, Tether currently holds 57,576 BTC, equivalent to approximately $2.4 billion, with an average purchase price of $22,480 per coin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This implies that Tether&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings have gained around 85%, or $1.1 billion, since their acquisition.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The increase in Tether&#8217;s unrealized profit can be primarily attributed to the recent surge in BTC&#8217;s price. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin briefly surpassed the $42,000 mark before settling at its current price of $41,845.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 13.1% increase.</span></p>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In May 2023, Tether announced its plans to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-plans-15-of-its-net-profits-into-bitcoin-move-of-confidence.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allocate up to 15% of net realized profits</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> into Bitcoin on an ongoing basis. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility, the stablecoin issuer views it as a robust long-term investment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential,&#8221; Paolo Ardoino, Tether&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer, said at the time. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tether&#8217;s decision to bolster its Bitcoin reserves is aimed at diversifying its holdings beyond cash and cash equivalents. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By holding BTC and other assets, Tether aims to protect its reserves from the loss of purchasing power during prolonged cryptocurrency market downturns.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the stablecoin issuer aims to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-aims-to-invest-half-a-billion-dollar-in-mining-ventures-over-next-six-months-to-become-a-top-miner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">invest half a billion dollars</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to become one of the world’s leading Bitcoin miners. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company’s investment strategy includes constructing its own mining facilities and acquiring stakes in other mining companies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new venture represents a significant departure from Tether’s primary business of running the USDT stablecoin, which maintains a one-to-one value with the US dollar. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tether generates revenue by managing a reserve of US Treasury bills and other assets backing the USDT stablecoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As of September 30, the company had accumulated around $3.2 billion in excess cash. </span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that Tether is not the only entity reaping the benefits of Bitcoin&#8217;s surge. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Led by CEO turned Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the technology company initiated its Bitcoin purchases in August 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company&#8217;s most recent acquisitions occurred last month, and as of November 30, MicroStrategy held 174,530 bitcoins acquired for $5.28 billion, with an average price of $30,252 per bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With Bitcoin reaching $42,000 earlier on Monday, the value of MicroStrategy&#8217;s holdings rose to approximately $7.3 billion, resulting in a profit exceeding $2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although the price has slightly retreated to $41,700 at the time of writing, it marks a significant milestone for Bitcoin, which hadn&#8217;t reached such levels since April 2022.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the 2022 bear market, Bitcoin plummeted to under $16,000, causing MicroStrategy&#8217;s initial bet to be in the red. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevertheless, Saylor continued to accumulate Bitcoin, financing the purchases through a combination of debt and equity issuance.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is expected to have a significant impact on investment appetite, as it would provide easier regulation, increased appeal, and simplified investment processes, according to Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;What we have right now is a risk rally, and bitcoin is also benefiting big time by falling yields,&#8221; Ozkardeskaya said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;There is also this positive bullish sentiment into next year because it is going to be the year of halving.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Historical trends have shown that bitcoin prices tend to rally following halvings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this year, investor sentiment toward cryptocurrencies and related assets was lukewarm due to high-profile collapses in 2022, leading to significant outflows from the sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the recent rally has propelled bitcoin&#8217;s value up by over 150% in 2023, positioning it for its best annual performance since 2020.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The introduction of the staking service represents Mantle&#8217;s expansion following the deployment of its Layer 2 network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The concept of liquid staking, which enables users to free up their capital from staked assets, has gained popularity on Ethereum. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, this has resulted in a concentration of ETH stakes with major providers like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mantle aims to address this issue by offering a wider range of solutions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The protocol originated from a proposal in the Mantle governance forum in July 2023 and has since undergone an alpha phase in October, followed by a permissionless phase to broaden access and participation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the launch of Mantle LSP, users can stake ether and receive Mantle-staked ether (mETH) as a token representing their stake.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The concentration of ETH staking is a result of network effect through a feedback loop of increasing name recognition and use case,” said Jordi Alexander, Chief Alchemist at Mantle. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“By focusing on mETH’s adoption in LSDfi both in the Mantle ecosystem and beyond, and its capital efficiency in maintaining the highest sustainable yield, Mantle LSP intends to be a part of the solution by creating more options for users.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since merging with BitDAO in May 2023, Mantle has accumulated one of the most significant community treasuries in the cryptocurrency space. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to DeepDAO, its treasury includes assets worth $470 million in ether and over $200 million in stablecoins.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buterin Expresses Concern About Staking Concentration</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also joined the cult of those voicing concer regarding the concentration of power among Ethereum’s liquid staking providers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lido, a prominent liquid staking pool, currently controls over 32% of the staked ether on Ethereum, with holdings distributed across different validators. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alongside Rocket Pool, Lido is a significant player in the ecosystem, but Buterin highlighted the need for more robust safety mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buterin proposed exploring additional solutions to enhance the safety and decentralization of liquid staking. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-ethereum-staking-providers-promise-not-own-more-than-22-of-validators.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of Ethereum.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rocket Pool</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">StakeWise</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stader Labs</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Diva Staking</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Puffer Finance</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit rule.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lido Finance</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> has decided not to commit to the self-limit rule.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in June, the project put forward a proposal to impose a limit on Lido’s maximum stake.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Less than one half of one percent of the votes cast were in favor of the self-limit rule, while those holding more than 99% of Lido’s governance tokens, LDO, voted for the protocol to not hold back on its growth.</span></p>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the second-largest staking provider, holds only an 8.7% market share, according to data from Dune Analytics.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shockingly, only 690 games managed to maintain a somewhat active player base, while a staggering 2,100 games have ceased operations, which translates to an alarming annual failure rate of 80.8% for Web3 games during this period. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The failure rate was calculated by comparing the number of failed games to the total number of games launched.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CoinGecko defines a failed Web3 game as one that experiences a 99% drop in active users based on a 14-day moving average from its peak. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The discouraging outlook is surprising considering the initial acclaim Web3 gaming received within the crypto community, offering users the ability to earn substantial rewards and tangible value from their gaming experiences. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The sector has also attracted significant interest and investments in the crypto space.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even in the current year, Web3 gaming projects have secured over $2 billion in funding. However, the CoinGecko report casts doubt on the sustainability of the industry.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2022 Saw Highest Failure Rate in GameFi</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2021, the highest number of blockchain games were launched in a single year, totaling 738. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, during the 2022 bear market, Web3 gaming faced challenging circumstances, resuling in the highest failure rate, with 742 games unable to sustain themselves. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More specifically, the failure rate for Web3 games reached 107% last year as a record-high 742 games shut down.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The failure rates for Web3 games in 2019 and 2020 were at a staggering 95%, while 2021 experienced the lowest failure rate at 45%.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report noted the impact of the bear market on GameFi development and interest, with only 244 Web3 games launched between 2019 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During this period, the failure rate rose to 94.3% in 2019 and remained at 94.2% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Surprisingly, despite the number of failed games increasing to 339 in 2021, it recorded the lowest failure rate due to the crypto bull run.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">509 Web3 Games Have Ceased Operations in 2023</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">So far this year, 509 Web3 games have already ceased operations, resulting in a 70% failure rate. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although this marks a lower failure rate compared to 2022, it suggests a potential stabilization in the GameFi and Web3 gaming industry, potentially attributed to the recent market recovery and signs of a bullish trend.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that some of the more prominent Web3 games have also suffered a major setback. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While CryptoKitties, launched in 2017, initially generated significant interest as the first Web3 game, its adoption has since slowed. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, prominent Web3 games like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Axie Infinity have emerged and solidified their position in the market.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A French court has acquitted the individuals accused of orchestrating the $8.5 million hack on Platypus Finance, an automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Avalanche blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/12/01/piratage-de-la-plate-forme-de-cryptomonnaies-platypus-les-deux-accuses-relaxes-par-la-justice_6203417_4408996.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report by Le Monde</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the defendants, identified as Mohammed and Benamar M., were arrested shortly after the attack, thanks to the assistance of crypto investigator ZachXBT and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 22-year-old Mohammed faced charges related to the cyberattack, while his brother was accused of receiving stolen goods. Prosecutors had sought a five-year prison sentence for Mohammed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the trial, Mohammed claimed to be an &#8220;ethical hacker&#8221; who planned to return the stolen funds to the protocol, hoping to receive a 10% bonus. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, due to an error during the flash loan attack, he inadvertently locked away a significant portion of the stolen funds, managing to recover only around $270,000. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a counter-hack, Platypus was able to salvage $2.4 million in USDC.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Court Dismisses Charges of Unauthorized Access</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The court ruled that since the smart contract used by Mohammed was publicly accessible, charges of unauthorized access to a computer system did not apply. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the court deemed Mohammed&#8217;s use of Platypus&#8217;s &#8220;emergency withdrawal&#8221; smart contract, which had the vulnerability he exploited, as not constituting fraud.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, the charges related to money laundering and receiving stolen goods were also dropped. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the court reminded the brothers that Platypus could still pursue legal action against them in civil court. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The judges made it clear that the acquittal did not grant them unrestricted immunity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in October, Platypus Finance </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-protocol-platypus-finance-hacked-for-over-2-million-avalanche-heres-what-happened.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">fell victim to a security breach</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> resulting in the loss of over $2 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attack was executed through a flash loan attack, specifically targeting the AVAX-sAVAX liquidity pool.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flash loans are a feature in decentralized finance that enables users to borrow assets without providing collateral, as long as the loan is repaid within the same transaction block. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unfortunately, attackers have found ways to exploit this mechanism, manipulating market prices or exploiting vulnerabilities within DeFi protocols. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By borrowing substantial sums, attackers can artificially create market conditions, taking advantage of the resulting discrepancies for profit before repaying the loan, all within a single transaction block.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Long Way Before Crypto is Safe</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">While crypto security is without a doubt a critical concern, the industry is still in its early stages when it comes to protecting digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“With numerous hacks and exploits occurring, it’s evident that there’s a lot of work to be done to make the field safer,” Sipan Vardanyan, CEO and Co-Founder at crypto security firm Hexens, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/theres-long-way-ahead-make-crypto-safer-hexens-ceo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said in a recent interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with Cryptonews.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So far this year, Web3 platforms have </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-loses-12-billion-hacks-rug-pulls-so-far-2023-report.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">lost over $1.2 billion</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in hacks and rug pulls, according to a report from Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report revealed a total of 211 separate incidents contributing to this massive sum, with the month of August alone accounting for $23.4 million in losses.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jason Lowery, a member of the United States Space Force, has proposed the use of proof-of-work (PoW) networks, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, as a means to protect the country from cyber-inflicted warfare. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonplowery_an-open-letter-to-the-defense-innovation-activity-7136779515376087040-Wq3c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">letter addressed to the US Defense Innovation Board</a>, Lowery emphasized the broad strategic significance of Bitcoin&#8217;s technology for cybersecurity and national security.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He pointed out that while Bitcoin is commonly known as a monetary system, it can also secure all forms of data, messages, and command signals. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As a result, this misconception underplays the technology’s broad strategic significance for cybersecurity, and consequently, national security.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He urged the Defense Innovation Board to advise the Secretary of Defense to investigate the national strategic importance of PoW systems like Bitcoin in deterring cyberattacks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Drawing parallels with physical security strategies, Lowery argued that the steep costs associated with resource-intensive computers in a proof-of-work system can act as a deterrent for adversaries. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He highlighted the potential cybersecurity applications of Bitcoin and its role in maintaining the United States&#8217; position as a global superpower in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Can Safeguard Data Transfers</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Lowery, Bitcoin&#8217;s utilization of the global electric power grid as a large, physically costly computer can safeguard data and messages traversing the internet and constrain malicious actors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He emphasized that integrating Bitcoin&#8217;s cybersecurity application would align perfectly with a strategic offset and stated that the U.S. Department of Defense may have already lost valuable time by not implementing it.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“[It is] the beginning of a cybersecurity revolution. It converts the global electric power grid into a large, physically costly computer, or ‘macrochip,’ and uses it to physically constrain malicious actors and safeguard a wide range of data and messages traversing the internet.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lowery, a national defense fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is a proponent of cybersecurity tools based on the Bitcoin base layer. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a previous proposal, he suggested that such tools can transform the country&#8217;s national security.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase CEO Says Crypto Can Help US Maintain Dominance</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also believes that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can play a crucial role in helping the United States maintain its dominance with the U.S. dollar. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a December post on X (formerly Twitter), Armstrong suggested that cryptocurrencies can work alongside the dollar, rather than replacing it, as a natural check and balance to defend American interests in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I think it will be a natural check and balance that will complement the dollar and be the best defender of long term American interests,” the crypto boss wrote. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">One idea I’ve been contemplating is that Bitcoin may be the key to extending western civilization.</p>
<p>The natural trend of whichever country has the reserve currency is to inflate the money supply and increase deficit spending until it loses that advantage. The U.S. is somewhere on…</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Armstrong <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="🛡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1731460958298788232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Armstrong argued that, historically, leaders have failed to retain the reserve currency by inflating the money supply and increasing deficit spending. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He said cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to fiat currencies and could be seen as a hedge against inflation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/">USD Coin (USDC)</a> and the emergence of flat coins are expected to play a major role in unifying the worlds of traditional finance and cryptocurrency.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The distribution will occur in four phases, as outlined by the project in a November announcement. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The first phase will release one billion Jupiter tokens to users who have conducted a minimum of $1,000 in swap volume on the protocol by the snapshot date of November 2.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An additional 1% will be allotted to community members on platforms like Discord and Twitter, as well as developers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meow expressed the belief that this breakdown would reward power users and contributors more significantly, while also providing an incentive for others to engage with the platform. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A federal judge has warned attorneys from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding their &#8220;false and misleading&#8221; arguments in a court filing. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attorneys are accused of persuading the court to freeze the assets of a cryptocurrency firm based on misleading information, as revealed in a court order.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.141167/gov.uscourts.utd.141167.215.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">order</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, issued by U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby of the U.S. District Court in Utah, highlights concerns about the SEC&#8217;s attorneys making deceptive claims regarding the crypto project Debt Box&#8217;s alleged attempts to transfer its assets and investors&#8217; funds overseas. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These arguments led the court to freeze the project&#8217;s bank accounts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Judge Shelby emphasized that the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;misrepresentations&#8230; undermined the integrity of the case&#8217;s proceedings&#8221; and caused &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; to Debt Box.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sanctions, as defined by Law.com&#8217;s legal dictionary, are penalties imposed by a court on individuals who knowingly provide false statements or violate court procedures. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In civil law, these penalties often take the form of monetary fines.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Initially, the federal judge had imposed a temporary restraining order on Debt Box in August, restricting the company&#8217;s access to its assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the order was later dissolved after Debt Box demonstrated that it had not moved any funds outside the U.S. or closed its bank accounts, as claimed by the SEC. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Debt Box&#8217;s lawyers highlighted this information in a filing.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the time of reporting, the SEC&#8217;s Utah office had not responded to requests for comment on the matter.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC Alleged that Debt Box Sold Unregistered Securities</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC initially filed a lawsuit against Debt Box in July, alleging that the company engaged in selling unregistered securities known as &#8220;node licenses&#8221; since 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Debt Box purportedly misled investors by claiming that these licenses would mine cryptocurrency and increase in value. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, according to the SEC&#8217;s original complaint, Debt Box was actually minting the cryptocurrency themselves using computer code.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to the judge&#8217;s findings, Judge Shelby has requested the SEC&#8217;s attorneys to provide a response addressing the lack of context and factual basis in their arguments regarding Debt Box&#8217;s alleged attempts to move funds overseas. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator has been given a two-week period to respond to this inquiry, as stated in the order.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is not the first time the SEC has been under scrutiny for its regulatory approach. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in June, Congressman </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ritchie Torres</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> asked the agency to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-urged-abandon-crypto-crusade-by-congressman-torres-after-ripple-legal-battle.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">provide clear rules</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for crypto instead of “indiscriminately” treating the majority of crypto assets as securities under its purview. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Torres penned an open letter to SEC Chairman </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/editors/gary-gensler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gary Gensler</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, expressing his discontent with the agency’s failure to issue clear guidance to the cryptocurrency industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has not issued a single rule on crypto assets, nor has it given any clear guidance,” said Torres. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“All it has done is sent mixed messages, one after the [other], not only contradicting the CFTC but often contradicting itself.”</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&#8217;s move to start a public comment period for spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> ETF applications earlier than expected has stirred up optimism around the launch of these products. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On November 28, the SEC published filings instituting proceedings to receive public feedback on the proposed </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-99030.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Franklin Bitcoin ETF</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2023/34-99031.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> funds.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move, according to analysts, signals a potential acceleration of the SEC&#8217;s timeline for approving an anticipated &#8220;spotcoin&#8221; ETF.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Typically, the SEC has 240 days to approve or deny an ETF filing and is required to provide updates on its decision at specified intervals. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Franklin Templeton&#8217;s application was not due for a decision until January 1. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, by opening the public comment period earlier, the SEC may be indicating its intention to expedite the approval process for spotcoin ETFs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted on X that the SEC&#8217;s decision to initiate a comment period for Hashdex &#8220;all but confirms for me that this was likely a move to line every applicant up for potential approval by the Jan. 10, 2024 deadline.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer, agreed that the SEC filings suggest the regulator is preparing to approve the funds around Jan. 10.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Really the only way it makes sense,” he </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/SGJohnsson/status/1729575861664243928?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tweeted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. “Pretty sure we can lock this one up.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Franklin Templeton, a firm with approximately $1.5 trillion in assets under management, initially filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in October. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, its filing faced a delay on November 15. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On November 29, Franklin Templeton amended its prospectus, stating that it had addressed the SEC&#8217;s questions and concerns regarding its application.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC Expected to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC has historically denied or delayed spotcoin ETFs due to concerns over market manipulation and investor protection. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, following a landmark lawsuit loss to Grayscale Investments in August, the agency began collaborating more closely with a dozen firms to explore the possibility of bringing such funds to the market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many industry participants, including Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, believe that the SEC will approve multiple applications simultaneously to prevent any single firm from gaining a first-mover advantage.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analysts at financial services firm </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cantor Fitzgerald</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> also believe the long-awaited spot </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-cantor-fitzgerald-grows-confident-heres-why.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC ETF is inching closer to reality</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company, known for its prime brokerage and investment banking services, has grown confident in the approval of applications from asset managers seeking to launch a spot ETF for Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, the SEC is evaluating 13 applications for spot BTC ETFs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the most recent application by Swiss-based Pando Asset, submitted just two days ago, is unlikely to be considered alongside the earlier submissions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that the optimism around the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF has fueled the recent rally in crypto markets, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency reach as high as $38,000.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There has been a surge in </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">meme coins</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> linked to Elon Musk following the billionaire&#8217;s verbal outburst at X (formerly Twitter) advertisers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meme coins have become a breeding ground for eccentric tokens inspired by various personalities and events. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This week, the latest addition to this trend comes in the form of meme coins linked to Musk, who caused a stir when he publicly told Disney CEO Bob Iger and other company heads to &#8220;go fuck yourself&#8221; during an on-stage interview.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The verbal outburst led to Disney, Apple, IBM, and Ubisoft pulling their advertising from Twitter. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These companies expressed concerns about antisemitic and white nationalist content appearing alongside their ads on the platform, as well as Musk amplifying an antisemitic post and criticizing the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit organization focused on combating antisemitic hate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, unfazed by the reasons stated by these companies for withdrawing their spending from Twitter, Musk openly criticized them. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Elon Musk has a message for all the corporations pulling ad money from X: </p>
<p>&quot;Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/9gStlAbjFn">pic.twitter.com/9gStlAbjFn</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1729992177353105799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The outburst went viral and became the inspiration for a series of meme coins, following the ongoing trend of Musk-themed crypto tokens that often rise to prominence but quickly fade away.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Various &#8220;GFY&#8221; tokens have emerged across networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, as reported by GeckoTerminal. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While most of these tokens lack significant liquidity, the GFY Ethereum token pool on Uniswap boasts over $600,000 in liquidity. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a current price of just $0.0000107, the token holds a market cap of $7.28 million, experiencing a 77% increase in value in a single day.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meme Coins Around Tesla&#8217;s Cybertruck Emerge</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similarly, a multitude of meme coins themed around Tesla&#8217;s recently released Cybertruck has surfaced, with the largest being deployed on the BNB Chain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The CYBERTRUCK token has generated approximately $671,000 in trading volume over the past day.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its price has surged by 125% to surpass $0.09, although it currently maintains a market cap of only $163,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meme coins are notorious for their volatility, often experiencing dramatic rises driven by hype and their association with public figures and recent events. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, they are also susceptible to sudden crashes. In some cases, the anonymous creators of these tokens engage in &#8220;rug pulls,&#8221; wherein they exploit investors as a means to exit the market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Consequently, investing in meme coins comes with substantial risks, attracting primarily self-proclaimed &#8220;degen&#8221; traders.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Musk has become a prominent figure in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to meme coins. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His tweets and public statements have wielded significant influence over the market, often leading to dramatic price fluctuations and capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Musk&#8217;s connection with meme coins can be traced back to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-elon-musks-doge-1-moon-mission-launch-approaches-will-doge-reach-1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">his fondness for Dogecoin</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a cryptocurrency originally created as a joke but which gained a devoted following. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The billionaire has previously endorsed Dogecoin in numerous tweets, which has consistently sparked excitement and speculation among traders, resulting in substantial price surges. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His endorsement of the cryptocurrency has even led to the creation of other meme coins inspired by his persona.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> has revealed a significant increase in law enforcement requests over the past years in its latest transparency report.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/transparency-report-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the number of requests received by Coinbase this year has tripled compared to 2020.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Out of the 13,079 requests for information, nearly half of them originated from the United States. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Germany accounted for 15% of the total requests, followed by the United Kingdom and Spain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The overwhelming majority, 96%, were related to criminal investigations, while the remaining requests pertained to civil or administrative matters.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the report, Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s chief legal officer, emphasized the company&#8217;s commitment to providing an appropriate and tailored response to these requests. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Where necessary, we will seek to narrow requests that are overly broad or vague in order to provide a more appropriately tailored response, and in some cases we object to producing any information at all,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Voluntary transparency reports have become customary among large tech companies, with Coinbase joining the ranks of Verizon, AT&amp;T, Apple, and Google. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although Coinbase&#8217;s total number of requests marks a 6% increase from 2022, it pales in comparison to the staggering 127,766 requests received by Verizon in just the first half of this year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For context, San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken reported 3,705 law enforcement requests in 2022, with the majority of requests originating from outside the United States. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2023, Coinbase witnessed a threefold increase in requests from Ukraine. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, government agencies in Australia, Portugal, Romania, and Nigeria more than doubled their requests, according to the report.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase Expands Global Presence Despite Regulatory Hurdles</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase has been actively expanding its global presence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in September, the exchange revealed that it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-becomes-registered-crypto-exchange-spain.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has secured</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> compliance registration from the </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bank of Spain</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, making it a registered crypto exchange in the country.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The registration with the Bank of Spain allows Coinbase to offer its full suite of products and services to both retail and institutional users in Spain while ensuring compliance with the country’s legal framework.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past year, Coinbase has obtained Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registrations in several European countries, including Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It has also received in-principle approval and launched its services in Singapore, Brazil, and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company’s push for global expansion comes amid growing regulatory hostility in the US.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in June, the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-coinbase-sued-by-sec-just-day-after-binance-lawsuit-which-firm-next.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC sued Coinbase</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for selling unregistered securities and a number of other alleged wrongdoings. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The commission also accused the exchange of illegally running a range of financial services, including trading securities and failing to register as a securities exchange.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the SEC lawsuit, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-receives-cease-desist-notices-from-11-us-states.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">received Show Cause orders</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> from 11 US states, which requires Coinbase to justify why it shouldn’t cease operations in the states. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Hong Kong Securities &amp; Futures Professionals Association, an influential industry trade group, has proposed the establishment of an initial coin offering (ICO) portal in the city. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The suggestion was included in the group&#8217;s </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.hksfpa.org/file.aspx?clid=143&amp;atid=1659&amp;lan=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">comments on the Hong Kong&#8217;s</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> budget for 2024-25, addressed to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po and Deputy Financial Secretary Wong Wai-lun.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposed ICO portal in Hong Kong would serve as a platform for conducting regulatory-compliant token offerings. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By creating a controlled environment, authorities can mitigate risks associated with fraudulent ICOs while providing opportunities for legitimate projects to access funding. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a potential bull market on the horizon, industry stakeholders, including the Hong Kong Securities &amp; Futures Professionals Association, believe that revisiting ICOs within a regulated framework could unlock new opportunities for both investors and projects.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the specifics of the proposed ICO portal are yet to be determined, its potential launch would offer a regulated avenue for token issuers to raise funds and investors to participate in promising blockchain projects. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ICOs emerged as a fundraising method in 2015, following Ethereum&#8217;s launch, and gained significant popularity. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the ICO landscape faced setbacks due to numerous scams and violations of securities regulations. Hong Kong, once a thriving hub for ICO listings, witnessed regulatory measures to delist many tokens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While security token offerings (STOs), compliant ICOs that emerged later, failed to attract substantial investor interest in Asia, the industry landscape has since evolved. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hong Kong to Expedite Approval Process For Crypto Products</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">JPEX </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">scandal, regarded as potentially the largest financial fraud in Hong Kong‘s history, has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-government-accelerates-cryptocurrency-product-approvals-following-jpex-rugpull-osl-compliance-exchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">prompted the Hong Kong government to expedite</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the approval process for cryptocurrency products to promote compliance in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to OSL Compliance Exchange, a licensed virtual asset platform, financial technology solution providers have shown interest in the potential benefits of integrating tokenized platforms with banks in the future. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This integration could leverage the public’s trust in banks, thereby facilitating the growth of the virtual asset industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in June, Hong Kong implemented its new regulatory framework for crypto last month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new rulebook </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-hub-making-hong-kong-pushes-forward-with-plans-for-retail-crypto-trading.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allows retail investors</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the ability to trade virtual assets, instead of restricting digital assets trading to professional investors and traders with at least $1 million in bankable assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As part of the new regulations, the SFC has also started providing licenses to crypto exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">OSL and Hashkey Group have become the first crypto exchanges in the city to receive licenses from the SFC. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They also enjoy crypto-to-fiat conversion services from ZA Bank, the largest online-only bank in Hong Kong. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The bank allows users of the trading platforms to withdraw crypto deposits in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and Chinese yuan. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Billionaire investor and CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz has expressed an optimistic outlook for assets like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, gold, and silver as the Federal Reserve undergoes a shift in its monetary policy.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-11-29/novogratz-on-economy-binance-settlement-and-bitcoin-video">interview with Bloomberg TV</a>, Novogratz highlighted that as the central bank transitions from a hawkish stance to a more dovish one, it will unleash &#8220;animal spirits&#8221; in the financial markets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He pointed out that the US dollar has already started to weaken as market participants anticipate a pivot by the Fed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The seasoned investor remained bullish on the euro, Australian dollar, and Brazilian real, while maintaining a short position on the Chinese yuan due to underlying structural issues within the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a short dollar position, Novogratz expects the US economy to slow down, inflation to cool off, and the Fed to initiate rate cuts. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In such a scenario, he believes that assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin will perform well.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Novogratz expressed his positive sentiment towards gold, mentioning that if the precious metal sustains a close above $2,000 for a few weeks, it could embark on a significant upward trajectory. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, he noted that silver appears to be primed for a surge as it faces a squeeze in market conditions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Gold, silver, bitcoin really all should do well if the Fed is finished hiking rates and starting to cut,&#8221; Novogratz predicted.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More Factors Could Drive BTC Price Up</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Novogratz further elaborated that several other factors could drive Bitcoin to new heights, including the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a shortage of sellers in the market, and the upcoming halving cycle.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Novogratz concluded by stating that the forthcoming election year in 2024 would introduce additional political uncertainty, serving as a tailwind for Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Moreover, as the United States, Europe, and Japan continue to grapple with fiscal challenges, investors are seeking alternative stores of value, which initially fueled the interest in Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The optimism around the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF has fueled the recent rally in crypto markets, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency reach as high as $38,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analysts at financial services firm </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cantor Fitzgerald</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> believe the long-awaited spot </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-cantor-fitzgerald-grows-confident-heres-why.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC ETF is inching closer to reality</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company, known for its prime brokerage and investment banking services, has grown confident in the approval of applications from asset managers seeking to launch a spot ETF for Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC has been hesitant to approve a spot bitcoin ETF due to concerns about potential manipulation on offshore spot platforms.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, Cantor Fitzgerald believes that the market surveillance procedures proposed by new applicants could address these worries and sway the SEC towards approval.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The firm’s analysts Josh Siegler and Will Carlson emphasized the importance of establishing a “comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size” to appease regulators.</span></p>

<p>&mdash; Trust Wallet (@TrustWallet) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrustWallet/status/1729947185049940320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Increased Transaction Per Block Can Impact Nodes?</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Bitcoin node refers to a computer or device that participates in the Bitcoin network by maintaining a full copy of the Bitcoin blockchain and relaying transactions and blocks to other nodes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Essentially, it acts as a communication point within the network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Increased transactions per block in the Bitcoin network can put pressure on nodes due to several reasons.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For one, Bitcoin has a maximum block size limit of 1 megabyte (MB). Each block can only accommodate a certain number of transactions within this size limit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When there is a surge in transaction volume, the number of transactions waiting to be included in a block increases. This can result in congestion and delays in confirming transactions, as nodes prioritize transactions with higher fees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, nodes need to receive and propagate transactions and blocks across the network. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When the number of transactions per block increases, the network&#8217;s bandwidth can become strained. Nodes have to transmit more data, leading to slower propagation times. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, increased latency can occur as nodes compete to propagate their transactions and blocks, resulting in delays and potential synchronization issues.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is also the issue of computational resources. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the number of transactions per block increases, nodes need to perform more calculations to verify the validity of each transaction and ensure consensus. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This can strain the computational capacity of nodes, leading to slower processing times and potential performance issues.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has proposed amendments to the trust&#8217;s agreement in preparation for a potential uplisting to a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> exchange-traded fund (ETF). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move aims to align GBTC&#8217;s structure with other applicants, including asset management giant BlackRock, and optimize its position in the evolving market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposed updates, which will be subject to a shareholder vote, involve two key modifications to the trust agreement, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1588489/000095017023066760/gbtc_pre_14a_v2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a Wednesday filing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, the amendment enables the collection of fees on a daily basis instead of the current monthly collection. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, this structural change is separate from any potential fee reduction, which Grayscale has committed to but is yet to finalize. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, GBTC charges a 2% management fee, while typical fees for firms awaiting spot bitcoin ETF approval range from 0.7% to 1%, as per Matrixport&#8217;s analyst report.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New Amendment Allows for Comingling of Assets</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The second proposed update allows for the commingling of assets in an omnibus account, streamlining the creation and redemption of shares. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The enhancement is made possible through the Coinbase Custody service, which will also be employed by BlackRock iShares and other spot ETF applicants. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The efficient processing mechanism is crucial for ETFs, as it facilitates the seamless trading and tracking of underlying assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Grayscale&#8217;s proposed amendments are part of its ongoing efforts to optimize the GBTC structure and ensure readiness for an uplisting to NYSE Arca as a spot bitcoin ETF, pending regulatory approvals. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that the amendments are not essential for the conversion to an ETF, according to the filing.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shareholders have a 20-day period from the filing date to cast their votes on the proposed updates. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC to Approve Several ETF Applications at Once</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Industry analysts anticipate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve multiple spot bitcoin ETFs in rapid succession. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meanwhile, the specific company that will offer the ETF and the implications for the crypto markets, which have experienced a prolonged slump, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-surrender-bitcoin-etf-horizon-experts-predict.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">remain uncertain</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Grayscale has been at the forefront of the legal battle to secure SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF, a type of fund that has been available in Europe and Canada for years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the court proceedings started to favor Grayscale, major players in the financial industry, including BlackRock and Fidelity, also filed applications to offer their own ETFs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Given the optics, it would not be surprising if the SEC grants approval to a well-known traditional finance company like BlackRock first.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The optimism around the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF has fueled the recent rally in crypto markets, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency reach $35,198, the highest level since May 2022.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, estimating the demand for an ETF is challenging due to the diverse range of metrics used by investors and analysts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto firm </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NYDIG</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> estimates the demand for a spot bitcoin ETF at approximately $30 billion.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There has been an increase in donations to charities linked to Hamas following the resistance group&#8217;s attack on Israel on October 7.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Israeli officials, the surge in donations is estimated to be around 70%, CNBC </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/israel-officials-donations-to-hamas-linked-charities-up-70percent-since-oct-7-attack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported on Tuesday</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report noted that the exact amount of money cannot be independently confirmed. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stopping the flow of funds to Hamas is challenging due to the dispersed nature of the charity groups involved and their ability to change names and structures frequently.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report said that foreign funds have reached Hamas through three main channels, including direct support from Iran, the informal Islamic banking system known as Hawala, and cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Iran has reportedly provided Hamas with an annual cash infusion of $70 million to $100 million for military purposes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, Hamas has diverted foreign aid intended for the citizens of Gaza to construct an extensive network of tunnels and bunkers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Hawala system, based on trust rather than traditional banking, facilitates the movement of money without reliance on Western-style financial institutions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While some funds channeled through Hawala are intended for humanitarian needs in Gaza, Israel claims that a significant portion is diverted for military purposes by Hamas.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cryptocurrency has also emerged as a major source of funding for Hamas, with both charitable contributions and direct contributions being made. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tron, a cryptocurrency company, has been accused of evading Israeli requests to cut off accounts and has been linked to operating in Iran.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>, in particular, has been credited for complying with requests. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the recent $4.3 billion settlement between Binance and U.S. authorities highlights allegations of failure to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorist groups such as Hamas&#8217; Al-Qassam Brigades.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No Evidence of Major Crypto Donations to Hamas</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in October, blockchain analytics company Elliptic refuted claims that Hamas received millions in crypto donations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a blog post, the company said there is “no evidence to support the assertion that Hamas has received significant volumes of crypto donations.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report came in response to a an article published in The Wall Street Journal last week titled “Hamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions in Crypto,” which alleged that Hamas raised over $130 million in cryptocurrency between August 2021 and June 2022.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Wall Street Journal article has been referenced by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senator-warren-demands-action-against-crypto-funded-terrorism-following-hamas-attacks.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">US lawmakers including Senator Elizabeth Warren</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, who co-signed a letter with over 100 members of Congress urging the White House and Treasury Department to crack down on cryptocurrencies due to their alleged use in funding Hamas operations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, Elliptic revealed that the data has been misinterpreted.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“There is no evidence to suggest that crypto fundraising has raised anything close to this amount,” the analytics firm wrote in its blog post.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The UK national taxing authority has asked crypto users to disclose any unpaid taxes they might have in order to avoid fines. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-hmrc-about-unpaid-tax-on-cryptoassets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wednesday announcement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) asked crypto users to make a &#8220;voluntary disclosure of any unpaid tax&#8221; relating to income or gains from cryptoassets, including exchange tokens, NFTs, and utility tokens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The government agency warned that users who fail to pay their taxes would face additional penalties. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;If you do not contact us to declare your unpaid tax, you could be liable to additional interest and penalties.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The HMRC said before considering making a voluntary disclosure to the tax authorities, there are several key steps you need to take.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First, it is crucial to collect all the necessary information regarding the cryptoassets on which users owe taxes, including personal details such as your name, address, email address, and contact telephone number, as well as National Insurance number. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, users need to gather data on the number of cryptoasset transactions, the proceeds or income that they have not declared, and the number of years for which they need to disclose unpaid taxes.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The agency said the number of years users need to disclose depends on the circumstances surrounding their previous tax compliance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If they can demonstrate that they took reasonable care but still failed to pay the correct amount, they will only need to address unpaid taxes for the past four years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;If you did not pay enough because you did not take enough care, you must pay HMRC what you owe for a maximum of 6 years,&#8221; the agency said.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UK Government Pushes for More Regulations</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The UK government has been actively addressing policies related to artificial intelligence, financial technology, and the metaverse through regulatory measures, enforcement actions, and investigations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back in October, the </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">implemented some new rules pertaining to digital assets, which require crypto firms to register with the financial regulator and have their marketing materials approved by an FCA-authorized firm.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Key updates include exchanges providing clear warnings to customers about the risks associated with crypto investments. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Marketing materials must be fair, transparent, and not misleading. Additionally, a 24-hour cooling-off period for new customers is required.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this month, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bim Afolami</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-appoints-bim-afolami-as-economic-secretary-to-oversee-crypto-regulation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">was appointed as the economic secretary</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to the Treasury of the United Kingdom, where he has authority over policies that impact the adoption of digital assets and central bank digital currencies within the country.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He emphasized the need for regulators to strike a balance between effective oversight and allowing room for innovation and growth.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“There’s no point having the safest graveyard. Animal spirits need to be there, we need to innovate, we need to drive growth and initiative,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is facing a proposed class-action lawsuit for promoting crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawsuit, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/51497314/Sizemore_et_al_v_Ronaldo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed on November 27</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in a United States district court in Florida, asserts that Ronaldo played a role in the sale of unregistered securities in conjunction with Binance.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In mid-2022, Binance entered into a multiyear partnership with Ronaldo to promote a series of his own nonfungible tokens (NFTs), with several of the soccer star&#8217;s collections tied to Binance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The complaint argues that users who purchased Ronaldo&#8217;s NFTs were more likely to engage with Binance for other purposes, such as investing in what the plaintiffs claim are unregistered securities, including Binance&#8217;s BNB token and its crypto yield programs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the lawsuit, Ronaldo&#8217;s endorsement of Binance and his massive following of 850 million social media users significantly contributed to the exchange&#8217;s popularity. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Ronaldo’s promotions solicited or assisted Binance in soliciting investments in unregistered securities by encouraging his millions of followers, fans, and supporters to invest with the Binance platform.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The plaintiffs contend that Ronaldo&#8217;s NFT sales were exceptionally successful in promoting Binance, resulting in a 500% increase in searches for the exchange during the week following the initial sale.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawsuit asserts that Ronaldo should have been aware of Binance&#8217;s sale of unregistered crypto securities, given his investment experience and substantial resources that could have been used to seek external advice. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also references guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which warns celebrities about the necessity of disclosing payments received for promoting cryptocurrencies—a requirement that the complaint claims Ronaldo failed to fulfill.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposed class-action lawsuit has been brought by Michael Sizemore, Mikey Vongdara, and Gordon Lewis, who are seeking damages and funds to cover legal expenses.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance Faces Legal Action Despite DOJ Settlement</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance and its founder Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao are facing legal challenges despite a settlement with DOJ. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They recently pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion settlement to the U.S. government for violating Anti-Money Laundering laws and operating an unregistered money-transmitting business. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zhao has stepped down as CEO and may face up to 18 months in prison. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance has also committed to up to five years of compliance monitoring by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, as </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cz-not-off-the-hook-as-sec-continues-binance-us-investigation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still probing the exchange. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The agency is seeking evidence regarding Binance.US’s alleged backdoor control over customer assets, resembling a structure akin to FTX.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In June, the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC initiated legal action against Binance</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and its American counterpart, Binance.US, asserting their involvement in the sale of unregistered securities.</span></p>
