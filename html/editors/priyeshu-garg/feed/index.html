Source: coincodex.com</figcaption></figure><p><b>Bytom (BTM)</b><br>
Bytom was launched via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that began and ended on the 20th of July, 2017, capturing over USD 2.28 million in token sales. <br>
Bytom is a fully-fledged blockchain protocol designed to synergize artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. The goal of the project is to create what is called &ldquo;heterogeneous by-assets that can operate forms on their own blockchain within the wider Bytom network&rdquo;.</p><p><b>Ontology (ONT)</b><br>
Ontology, a blockchain distributed ledger network, launched on November 27, 2017, by  a Chinese company, OnChain. The Ontology platform employs a dual token (ONT and ONG) model. Ontology is one of the newest cryptocurrencies to be introduced into the market and it has been doing well in 2018, with the price getting to as high as USD 4.18. The advantage Ontology has over others is that it is listed on Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest altcoin exchange.</p><p><b>Loopring (LRC)</b><br>
Loopring is a decentralized and open protocol. It is not an exchange, but it is a code that links together exchanges and allows trading between them, managed by smart contracts, which is what makes them unique. It launched its ICO in August 2017, capturing USD 45 million over a two-week period. The Loopring ecosystem consists of different elements that work together in order to deliver full exchange functionality. </p><p><b>RChain (RHOC)</b><br>
RChain wants to become a blockchain solution with industrial-scale utility. In order to do this, &ldquo;RChain must provide content delivery at the scale of Facebook and support transactions at the speed of Visa&rdquo;, according to the website of the project. <br>
RChain architecture was documented in July of 2016.</p><p><b>VeChain (VEN)</b><br>
VeChain is a blockchain service company poised with a mission to build a trust-free and distributed business ecosystem in order to enable transparent information flow, efficient collaboration, and high-speed value transferring. It was founded in November 2015.</p><h3 data-param="2" id="top-5-losers">Top 5 Losers</h3><p>While some cryptocurrencies were soaring in 2018, many others have not had the same story to tell. </p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ad/849b0c3ec7.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ad/849b0c3ec7.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5ad/849b0c3ec7.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5ad/849b0c3ec7.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5ad/849b0c3ec7.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5ad/849b0c3ec7.png 2184w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Data from April 18. Source: coincodex.com</figcaption></figure><p><b>Bitcoin Diamond (BCD)</b><br>
Bitcoin Diamond was forked off from Bitcoin blockchain on 24th November 2017. The Bitcoin Diamond sets to solve problems such as lack of privacy, slow transaction confirmations, and a high threshold for new members. The pseudonym names of the Bitcoin Diamond are Team Evey and Team 007. BCD was selling for as high as USD 109, but the story seems to have changed in 2018, as the price has plummeted to USD 2.56 and its fall is mainly due to Bitcoin&rsquo;s dip. </p><p><b>Bitcoin Gold (BGD)</b><br>
Bitcoin Gold is a digital currency and a hard fork of Bitcoin. The hard fork occurred on October 24th, 2017. Bitcoin Gold once traded at USD 500 but as at 2018, it is well in the red at USD 52.14. Bitcoin Gold was created to &ldquo;return to the decentralized nature&rdquo; of the BTC, and give ordinary users an opportunity to mine the new digital currency.</p><p><b>Qtum (QTUM)</b><br>
The cryptocurrency, Qtum, is a hybrid of Ethereum and Bitcoin. While Ethereum is primarily a smart contract platform, Bitcoin was designed to be a value transfer tool, and Qtum is a bridge between these two. Qtum was launched in March 2017, with a crowdfunding campaign that lasted 30 days. It sold over USD 10 million worth of its token in the first 90 minutes, raising a total value of USD 15.7 million and stopped the campaign after five days. </p><p><b>Ripple (XRP)</b><br>
Released in 2012, Ripple is a technology that acts as a cryptocurrency and digital payment network for financial transactions. The digital currency, XRP, acts as a bridge to other currencies, as it does not discriminate between one crypto and another. This makes it easy for any currency to be exchanged for one another. In 2017, Ripple was one of the best performing digital assets, but they are not having it easy in 2018, as the price has nosedived, despite the hype in 2017 and the announcements of new partnerships and projects. </p><p><b>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</b><br>
Bitcoin Cash developers aims to &ldquo;increase confidence in cryptocurrency&rdquo;, as Bitcoin was criticized for slow transaction times, high mining fees and high energy consumption, factors that BCH&#8217;s supporters feel it combats. The fork from Bitcoin occurred on August 1, 2017.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are more than 200 live initial coin offerings (ICO) on the market, according to Coinschedule data, with another 150 due to launch shortly. As the ICO market is very dynamic and the number of live and upcoming projects is changing rapidly, we&rsquo;ve provided a snapshot of the top 10 most popular ICO categories on February 28. </p><p><b>Trading &amp; Investing</b><br>
The emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrency has created a new asset class that has opened up the trading and investment market to more people. Cryptocurrencies as tradable assets have traditionally proven to be highly volatile, but the volume of trades and investment continues to grow. Over the years, several cryptocurrency exchange platforms and other crypto investment vehicles have been launched. Binance, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms in the world, was launched via an ICO in July 2017. <br>
On February 28, there were 30 live ICOs in this category with about 20 more on the cards for the next few days and weeks.</p><p><b>Finance</b><br>
The original disruptor market for blockchain, the finance market has seen a number of notable blockchain-based projects over the years. There are many areas of application for blockchain technology in finance, including banking, digital identity, clearing and settlement, and digital identity management. One area of particular interest is the banking sector, where blockchain and smart contracts could completely digitize the industry. In total, there are 31 live finance-based ICO campaigns with almost 20 more set to launch.</p><p><b>Commerce &amp; Advertising</b><br>
The monopoly enjoyed in the commerce and advertising market by behemoths like Amazon, Google and Facebook has almost stifled the growth of the industry. Digital advertising is viewed as a declining market by most millennials &ndash; who are incidentally the biggest target group for advertising campaigns, yet the most likely to use adblockers. Content generators don&rsquo;t earn much for their work and all of the profit is in the hands of Facebook, Google, and the like.<br>
Blockchain technology has been identified as being able to &ldquo;democratize&rdquo; the commerce and advertising space, as well as create the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/3-ways-blockchain-can-make-your-internet-experience-profitab-1258.htm">potential for creators to monetize</a> their content. The Basic Attention Token (BAT) ICO of 2017 raised USD35 million in about 30 seconds. The project will reward users for viewing ads. There were 23 live ICOs in the commerce and advertising sector as of February 28, with around 15 more confirmed to commence soon.</p><p><b>Infrastructure</b><br>
Blockchain technology can be applied to public utility infrastructure like water and power. Inefficiency is one of the major banes of infrastructure development in many countries. The contract validation process is beset with a plethora of bottlenecks and administrative/bureaucratic red-tapes.<br>
Applying blockchain to infrastructure is not limited to the physical sense &ndash; it can also be applied to internet infrastructure management, as highlighted by projects such as Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Service (TBIS). These projects are revolutionizing the internet network structure. There are 18 active ICOs in the infrastructure space and 13 more are upcoming.</p><p><b>Social Network</b><br>
Social media is seen as the pinnacle of the Web 2.0 internet framework. Now, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/the-blockchain-is-coming-for-facebook-1229.htm">blockchain technology is looking to usher in Web 3.0</a>. There have been several blockchain-based social network platforms like Steemit, Synereo and Nexus. One common denominator of these platforms is their incentivized nature which rewards users and contributors &ndash; making them distinct from traditional social networks. As of February 28, there were 11 live social network-themed ICOs with 10 more in the pipeline.</p><p><b>Gaming &amp; Virtual Reality</b><br>
Blockchain is being touted as having the potential to revolutionize the gaming space by facilitating the establishment of decentralized parallel gaming universes that offer cross-platform support. Players will be able to import and export assets from one game to another. In the area of virtual reality (VR), projects like Decentraland and CEEK are looking to develop solutions at the intersection of blockchain and VR. There are 11 ongoing ICOs in this category with eight more scheduled to begin momentarily.</p><p><b>Payments</b><br>
Payments were the original use-case for blockchain and the arena has seen plenty of innovations. While each project strives to bring a bit of uniqueness to the scene, the core principles remain the same: faster and less expensive transactions. The emergence of smart contracts has taken blockchain-based payment protocols to greater heights. Scalability still remains a bit of problem but the signs are encouraging. There are 13 live ICOs in this category with five more on the cards within the next few days and weeks.</p><p><b>Gambling &amp; Betting</b><br>
Long before bitcoin and blockchain could gain any form of mainstream acceptance, bitcoin online casinos were already popular on the internet. In fact, it can be argued that blockchain technology has been able to connect with the gambling industry on a much deeper level than most other markets. Blockchain has enabled anonymous gambling to flourish, thus making entry into the industry a lot simpler for many would-be players. Currently, there are 12 active ICOs in the infrastructure space and 15 upcoming ICOs.</p><p><b>Drugs &amp; Healthcare</b><br>
Enhancements to the supply chain, improved data security, and easy tracking of payment, billings and claims are some of the potential applications of blockchain technology in the health industry. Of particular interest is in the drug supply chain management system. Blockchain technology can help to secure the drug supply chain on a global level. There are already some Hyperledger based systems, such as the Yijan Blockchain Technology Application System, which are dedicated to the health sector. On February 28, eight live ICO campaigns were ongoing with six more due to launch.</p><p><b>Mining</b><br>
Several start-up companies are entering into the cryptocurrency mining or staking arena. Cloud mining and staking services continue to multiply as individuals and corporations try to get a hold of valuable cryptocurrencies. Mining is seen as an alternative investment to cryptocurrency trading. On February 28, there were eight active ICOs in the infrastructure space and five upcoming ICOs.</p><p>***<br>
Among the runner-ups are ICOs in communications, data storage, identity and reputation solutions, and real estate. Less popular are ICOs related to charity and donations, legal projects and governance.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With cryptocurrencies ironing out issues and gaining credibility, several banks have opted to take a hard line on them, thereby frustrating the domestic efforts of virtual currencies to gain traction in the financial industry and greater world. </p><p>With renewed regulatory focus all over the world as lawmakers seek to both educate themselves on cryptocurrencies while enacting regulatory legislation, court battles are becoming the norm. </p><p>According to media reports, in a dramatic stance, Israeli banks have refused to open an account for a new cryptocurrency exchange Bitflash LTD.  </p><p>The company is suing Leumi Bank after all the banks in the area refused to open an account to enable it to start trading trading. </p><p>While a bank is not obliged to service any particular entity, records show that they have been obstructive in enabling a local company to open up for trading. Hoping to succeed in its action on the back of the findings that banking is thwarting the local economy, Bitflash attorney Alon Huberman pointed to his experience of the difficulties faced with banks. </p><p>With transcripts as evidence, even once the company had taken away all of the banks&#8217; concerns completely, they still refused to do business with Bitflash. In addition, some of the banks that declined Bitflash have companies with a similar focus which hold accounts with them, which suggests there is at least the open possibility of cartel-style dealings taking place to prevent certain companies from trading in the region. </p><p>Meanwhile, in Thailand, Reuters reported on February 12, 2018 that the Thai Central Bank has formally requested that all of the country&rsquo;s banks avoid backing cryptocurrencies in every way until policy on the issue can be formulated. Although labeled a &ldquo;request,&rdquo; polite missives from Thai political and formal business sectors are typically more an edict than anything else. </p><p>Moreover, in India, Koinex has suffered embarrassing issues related to users&rsquo; Indian rupee withdrawals. Stymied by a conflict between its payment service provider and its bank, Koinex has been diplomatically trying to resolve the issue, in what appears to be another case of banks pulling the rug out from underneath virtual currency business. Issues around legitimacy and taxation have been in the news since mid-2017, when India&rsquo;s courts felt compelled to look at the credibility of virtual currencies. </p><p><b>Dealing with &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;</b> </p><p>Also, while not targeting a specific company, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-declines-further-after-more-banks-ban-credit-crypto-1155.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several banks</a> in the US and the UK have banned crypto purchases with credit cards.  </p><p>Meanwhile, in Poland, the central bank has derided cryptocurrencies on YouTube. According to media reports, the bank has spent almost USD 30,000 funding a &ldquo;marketing campaign&rdquo; aimed at warding people off Bitcoin and others.   </p><p>It appears that banks view cryptocurrencies as being in conflict with their operating model, and so are engaging in various campaigns to slow or stop the growth of crypto-businesses. While banks want a piece of the action, they also fear doing business with the opposition. Employing tactics of obfuscation and worse, there seems no limit to what banks will do to maintain their hegemony at the expense of virtual currencies.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that figures are available for 2017, it appears South Korea&rsquo;s moderate regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies is paying dividends, at least to government. Some 30 of the country&rsquo;s cryptocurrency exchanges generated a combined USD 648 million in taxable revenue in 2017, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing politician Park Kwang-on. </p><p>The Upbit exchange appears first in line to lose a chunk of revenue, as it boasted a 52.9% market share, with Bithumb and Coinone ranking second and third respectively during 2017. Korbit was fourth, and is also facing a hefty tax bill. </p><p>The released figures are a spur to both private sector approval and governmental appraisal of digital currencies in South Korea. </p><p>The most impressive statistic is that, in 2017, revenues of South Korean virtual exchanges grew almost 90 times compared with 2016, when revenues were what now seem a paltry USD 7.5 million.  </p><p>Although January saw a costly ruling for exchanges operating in South Korea, with regulators deciding that exchanges would be liable for both corporate and local income tax, the financial figures are being seen as broadly positive for the future of cryptocurrencies in South Korea. Meanwhile, the total tax bill for digital exchanges amounts to around 24%, payable this spring for corporate and local tax combined, according to a separate report by Yonhap. </p><p>South Koreans are among the most enthusiastic nationalities for cryptocurrencies. The South Korean government&rsquo;s currently staid approach is seen as a relief to many investors, with the current climate boding well for those with ambitions for South Korea to become a south-east Asian hub. The apparent acceptance by government of cryptocurrency exchanges as just another tax-paying business sector demonstrates a wish to integrate cryptocurrencies fully into the existing regulatory framework. </p><p>Singapore and other neighbors are among other nations who have adopted a cautious, yet relaxed, approach to virtual currencies. All of the countries displaying a positive attitude towards crypto exchanges seem to have a detailed understanding of the value of blockchain technology, with a hesitance to stymie the use of the blockchain with over-regulation with regard to cryptocurrencies.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unusual for the rest of the world, the Chinese government has always attempted &ndash; and largely succeeded &ndash; to control the uncontrollable. The liquidity of the internet is pervasive, but not in China. Alongside other tight controls on social media and online content, comes the new effort by the current regime to stamp out cryptocurrency trading.</p><p>Last year, the Chinese government made all domestic ICO (Initial Coin Offering) activity illegal, warned citizens not to participate in foreign ICOs, and ordered all local crypto exchanges to shut down. Now, the Chinese regime is set to enforce a nationwide ban on citizens trading cryptocurrencies offshore.</p><p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) stated that in order &ldquo;to prevent financial risks, China will step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs&rdquo;. The ban will entail blocking foreign websites that facilitate trading, as well as tightening up on entities promoting offers or trading in any way within the country.</p><p>Donald Zhao, a stand-alone trader who left Beijing for Tokyo as the local ban came into effect late in 2017 told South China Morning Post, &ldquo;It is common for people to use VPNs (Virtual Private Network) to trade cryptocurrencies, as many exchange platforms have relocated to Japan or Singapore.&rdquo; The new move means it would be even harder to circumvent the ban in China, while anyone promoting related business programs may be arrested, according to Zhao.</p><p>Ads for virtual currencies have already been discontinued on Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine. The local social media platform Weibo has also binned any promotion or depiction of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>But what is the Chinese experience after last year&rsquo;s bans?</p><p><b>Life finds a way</b></p><p><u>ICOs</u><br>
When an order to halt ICOs was first initiated, many in China immediately suspected this would be the first part of a multi-stage shutdown. Normally, when the Chinese government wants to make something complex illegal, it will not immediately outlaw the entire thing.</p><p>However, the Chinese have admitted that ICOs and virtual currency trading did not completely withdraw from the country following the official ban &ndash; many people turned to overseas platforms.</p><p><u>Buying/Selling crypto</u><br>
Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges are still operated locally in China. The reason why they were able to continue is that they completely relocated their operations to Hong Kong or another similar location.</p><p>Hong Kong is part of China, but it operates under significantly different laws. This is through a policy known as one country, two systems. Therefore, the laws requiring the shutdown of exchanges did not apply there. And so today, exchanges like Binance, Kucoin, and Huobi continue to be widely successful and accepted by traders all over the world.</p><p>For those wishing to buy and sell cryptocurrency for Chinese RMB, services like localbitcoins.com offer an easy way to do this. The service typically works in conjunction with Alipay (or WeChat pay), which is a mobile banking app that allows instant transfers with no fee through a mobile phone. In this way, Bitcoin trades can be made safely and instantly thanks to localbitcoins.com and its escrow and reputation tracking service.</p><p><u>Mining</u><br>
China is also often thought of as a location for the centralized factory mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At this point, the Chinese government has not directly made mining illegal. While they have taken some steps to rein in electricity usage in areas such as Sichuan province, the practice still continues generally unabated to this day.</p><p>Additionally, individual or hobby miners that mine out of their own homes are unaffected, as they are simply too small to appear on the radar. In either case, more and more Chinese miners are looking for new countries to relocate their business, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/the-great-migration-of-bitcoin-miners-to-canada-1180.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by <i>Cryptonews.com</i></a>.</p><p><u>Capital flight </u><br>
While most Western countries seem only interested in taxing income made through cryptocurrency investments or salaries, China seems to have another concern entirely. Last year saw the enactment of significant capital flight laws.</p><p>Capital flight laws are financial regulations that are designed to limit the flow of money from domestic to international accounts or sources. Basically, it aims to slow down the speed at which money can leave the country. In China, it is quite common for wealthy people to leave the country and move to greener pastures. Understandably, these wealthy people want to take their money with them.</p><p>The country has also been actively shutting down various loopholes such as using a debit card in a foreign country to buy luxury items, and then return them in exchange for cash.</p><p>While the government has not explicitly said so, it is obvious that cryptocurrency poses a potential capital flight risk.</p><p>***</p><p>What&rsquo;s next? It looks like the government is aiming to tighten regulations further on the crypto world. Li Lihui, former president of the Bank of China, one of the largest state-owned commercial banks in the country, told South China Morning Post, &ldquo;regulators will certainly step in&rdquo;, if any kind of financial innovations infringe upon the interests of consumers and affect the stability of the financial market. But will the crypto community find its way again?</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speculation is rife about India&rsquo;s first-ever homegrown cryptocurrency &ndash; Laxmicoin. It has not been launched yet, but a number of fraudulent websites are already ripping off unsuspecting investors by offering Laxmicoin for sale. Meanwhile, the crypto market is abuzz with rumors that Laxmicoin is in some way associated with the Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) &ndash; which it&rsquo;s not! At the same time, unconfirmed reports have appeared that Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, an Indian telecommunication giant, is developing its own cryptocurrency JioCoin.</p><p>I approached Mitthan Meena, co-founder of Laxmicoin, to try to clarify the myths and confusion surrounding the forthcoming crypto asset. </p><figure style="max-width: 635px"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a7/95a6fb936d.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 635px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5a7/95a6fb936d.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5a7/95a6fb936d.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5a7/95a6fb936d.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5a7/95a6fb936d.jpg 900w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><b>Mitthan, could you briefly introduce yourself and the team behind the development of Laxmicoin?</b></p><p>I have a Bachelor of Technology from Indian Institute of Technology (ITT), Delhi and a qualification in advanced project management from Stanford. I have worked in India, Ireland, and the USA &ndash; which included holding key positions in many start-ups. I have also contributed to the growth of a couple of start-ups as an angel investor.</p><p>I used to run a website called www.opencoin.in in 2013 and was very much involved in the cryptocurrency/blockchain circuit. That&#8217;s when I came up with the idea of Laxmicoin and started developing India&#8217;s first crypto coin with a friend who was working in the USA at the time but had agreed to move back to India.</p><p>Back then, we had a team of 10 engineers in Jaipur and everything was sailing smoothly. We were very close to funding the project. But then the RBI raids happened and India&#8217;s regulatory environment became increasingly hostile to the crypto economy. We had to stop. At that time, we also started communicating directly with RBI and were waiting for their permission to proceed. We eventually received a reply in 2014. They gave us standard guidelines. </p><p>Right now, we have an excellent team of five full-time employees based in our Jaipur office. We also have around eight more people working part-time for Laxmicoin. Some of these guys are IITians who have previously worked at Apple, Google, and other Fortune-10 companies. However, due to the lack of funds at our disposal, they are only able to contribute part-time right now. As we continue raising funds, we intend to hire some of them full-time. </p><p><b>What was the RBI&rsquo;s response and what is the current status in terms of negotiations/agreements with them?</b> </p><p>The RBI gave us the same guidelines as they issue when dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges and ICOs. There are some finer details, which can&#8217;t be disclosed at this juncture, but overall it was pretty much the same as their standard warning/guidelines.</p><p><b>Okay, so will the Laxmicoin ICO receive the RBI nod?</b></p><p>Well, we didn&#8217;t talk to the RBI regarding the ICO, but I don&#8217;t think the RBI will give us a positive response anytime soon on that. My assumption is that they will come with guidelines sometime soon, but that&rsquo;s just my opinion. Just to clarify, the RBI has no relation nor association with the development of Laxmicoin.</p><p><b>I understand the tough nature of the RBI. However, what was different in 2013, compared to now in terms of the government role? They still don&#8217;t seem fond of crypto.</b></p><p>Well, in 2013 they closed buysellbitco.in and Unocoin was raided. Laxmicoin suffered too. But now you can see all of them back in operation and doing good business. The RBI did not close any of the exchanges. </p><p>These exchanges convert crypto to Indian Ruppes (INR). As for Laxmicoin, we will be a cryptocurrency like any other cryptocurrency, for example Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum or IOTA. We will not change or convert to INR.</p><p><b>Can you explain the technicals of Laxmicoin? How is it different from Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin etc., apart from the fact that it is an Indian coin? What value does it add in terms of technology?</b></p><p>We have our own unique blockchain tech approach. We can&#8217;t disclose it yet, but it&rsquo;s  definitely unique. You could say we take a more &lsquo;mobile-friendly approach&rsquo;. We will disclose some of the details in our white paper soon, it&rsquo;s due to be released in February. We&rsquo;re spending most of our tech team time in testing and improving our tech.</p><p><b>The project has stalled over the past five years, the cryptosphere has largely changed since then. How well has the development of Laxmicoin been paced, relative to the cryptosphere?</b></p><p>We did a lot of hard work in 2013, but much of it is outdated today, given that  blockchain technology has come a long way in a short space of time. Now there are different and better blockchain approaches. </p><p>If you look at Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, they have scalability issues. Some of them are trying to solve this. As for us, we are also trying to come up with a more scalable and mobile friendly approach. The end result should be secure, scalable and mobile friendly. And that&rsquo;s exactly what we are working on.</p><p><b>What are the limitations of existing cryptocurrencies? Will they exist during Laxmicoin&rsquo;s ICO?</b></p><p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, Bitcoin, Ethereum and the likes offer slow transaction speeds, in addition to charging large fees. That isn&rsquo;t the true intent that Bitcoin and other crypto coins were created with. Bitcoin is not suitable for micro transactions, either. </p><p><b>Coming to the Indian context, what makes it better than using India&rsquo;s favorite mobile wallet PayTM? (PayTM charges no fees to the sender, whereas business receivers are charged just around 1%)</b></p><p>We are not a competitor to PayT, nor do we compare ourselves with it. We are in the crypto-space and Laxmicoin is a P2P or micro-transaction platform. In the long run, anyone can make their own payment gateway or payment solution atop the Laxmicoin blockchain. </p><p>We will have our P2P/micro-transaction solutions. Once we have opened our APIs, if someone wants to build a payment solution for one specific use-case, they will be able to do so on our platform very quickly and securely. Moreover, our transaction fee will be super super small, or even zero.</p><p><b>Do you have any solutions in mind which would keep fees minimal (or even free) when Laxmicoin scales to one million transactions per day? Usually cryptos start with the concept of free to small, and then fees go up with usage.</b></p><p>Yes, we are trying to work around that problem. We already have a prototype undergoing testing. As things stand today, a million transactions per day is possible, but not a million transactions per second or minute. Let me clarify that it&rsquo;s still in the beta phase, and needs some time before we can open it up.</p><p><b>So, do you have preliminary agreements with exchanges?</b></p><p>A few exchanges have reached out to us via email. We also had phone discussions with a few, but right now our focus is mostly on the technological aspects of Laxmicoin. We are in the process of hiring a business developer to take care of the business side of things. But yes, as of today, we are in discussion with a couple of exchanges.</p><p><b>What&#8217;s the growth strategy? Will you target Indian users only?</b></p><p>Initially, we are launching in India, but our focus in the long-run is global.</p><p><b>I saw a lot of scams using the name of Laxmicoin, including one fake announcement thread on bitcointalk where the poster was using your trademark document as a &#8216;permission from the RBI&#8217;. How are you dealing with such scams? Could you also share some more interesting ways people are trying to scam?</b></p><p>Seriously, we&rsquo;re at the height of scamming! They put my trademark with my name on it. But thankfully some hosting providers are willing to help. If you provide them with relevant data, they will shut the fraudulent sites for you. But others are not nearly as cooperative. Some Indian domain name providers, like Bigrock, are irresponsible, but others are mostly cooperating. </p><p>These scammers show Laxmicoin prices going high in seconds and make people believe that they will be rich in hours. Some people are also running Multi Level Marketing (MLM), or pyramid selling schemes in India. I would request people to stay away from these MLM schemes. I get loads of emails from agents asking about our MLM plans. I clearly tell them that we are not offering any MLM schemes.        </p><p><b>I feel for a coin to be truly decentralized, venture capitalists (VCs) should not be part of it. What is your opinion?</b></p><p>The coins will be decentralized only, but VCs help us by providing enough funds to build a great platform and great solutions. VCs don&#8217;t stop you from being decentralized, they are only there to help you offer a better solution.</p><p><b>Can you give any information about token distribution?</b></p><p>The only thing I can tell you now is that we want more and more people to have Laxmicoin and want to distribute it to many people. Our first conference will take place in Jaipur on 7 February, at which we&rsquo;ll distribute some coins to people.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pre-sale of the Venezuela&#8217;s oil-backed national cryptocurrency, the petro, will begin on February 20, while President Nicolas Maduro is clearly hoping that the release will ease some of the country&rsquo;s current economic hardships, according to CNBC. </p><p>In the meantime, critics are up in arms over the government&rsquo;s plan. A bold move on empty coffers, the motion is widely seen as a spurious attempt to trade on cryptocurrency&rsquo;s current enchantment.</p><p>However, Venezuelan President remained upbeat when announcing the offer on 30 January 2018, in spite of it being labeled a debt issuance by detractors. Critics point to the fact that the entire proposition flies in the face of the country&rsquo;s laws, and the proposed cryptocurrency is essentially illegal. The offer is backed by Venezuelan crude oil, something the parliamentary opposition has made expressly clear that is forbidden by law. </p><p>The details of the offer point to an overall value of USD 6 billion for the issuance, with the projected earnings on the presumption that the market accepts the offer as valid and agrees to terms at hand. Maduro mooted a total issue of 100 million tokens recently, each &ldquo;redeemable&rdquo; at the value of a single barrel of crude</p><p>In January, a newly-formed advisory group to the Venezuelan government, VIBE, have recommended that 38.4 million of the country&rsquo;s newly formed oil-backed cryptocurrency, the petro, be sold at private placements at a discount of up to 60%, as reported.</p><p>Muddying the concept of cryptocurrency, Maduro said on national television that &ldquo;all the cryptocurrencies of the world have been revalued after Venezuela&#8217;s announcements about the creation of the petro,&rdquo; while critics dismissed this bold statement as wishful thinking. </p><p>Moreover, Maduro&#8217;s socialist government has feted the issuance as a means to combat American sanctions. It hopes it will enable financial transactions and the preservation of normality in many critical public service arenas.</p><p>Venezuela has been looking for avenues down which to raise some cash, embroiled as it is in a crippling economic crisis. It&rsquo;s not great timing, as the value of Bitcoin has slumped in the first month of 2018. Yet it appears the Venezuelan government is out of options, as it desperately needs some hard currency to inject life into the economy.</p><p>The USA has taken issue with the proposal, warning its citizens of possible prosecution in terms of the current sanctions. It has claimed that &ldquo;[buying] the petro digital currency would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government,&rdquo; and that additional credit would not solve the larger problem at hand.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the approximate 260,000 people affected by the crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coincheck-hacked-more-than-500-million-xem-stolen-1093.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coincheck hack</a> were the Virtual Currency Girls, a Japanese pop band which actively promotes cryptocurrencies through its music and performances. </p><p>As part of their contract, the eight performers between the ages of 15 and 22 receive a large portion of their salaries in cryptocurrency &ndash; yet with the respective account among those frozen by Coincheck, they were unable to receive that portion of their income. Nonetheless, the members did not appear perturbed. </p><p>&ldquo;Our manager offered to pay us in yen, but we said no because we proudly promote the cryptocurrency in our performance and concert merchandise,&rdquo; shared Hinano Shirahama in an interview with Reuters. She represents Bitcoin in the group.</p><p>As part of their act, each member embodies a different digital currency, and dons a mask bearing the symbol of the one she represents. </p><p>The Virtual Currency Girls is still a relatively new addition to Japan&rsquo;s music industry. </p><p>Although the group&rsquo;s debut performance on January 12, 2018 was successful, the VC Girls have not yet established a name for themselves or attracted a significant fan-base. </p><p>As part of their act, the eight girls dress up in black and white maid costumes, sing and dance about cryptocurrency. Their primary objective is to raise awareness and promote the widespread benefits of cryptocurrencies, their investment potential and their applications. </p><p>&ldquo;We want to enlighten Japan through entertainment about the possibilities of virtual currency,&rdquo; said Rara Naruse, the apparent leader of the group and member who represents Bitcoin Cash.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><iframe width="560" height="315" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EODCw3jjeo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
