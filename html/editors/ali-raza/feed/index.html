Since many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/casinobit-review.htm">crypto casinos</a> are booming, their native assets are spiking in value.</p><p>Combine that with the transparency iGaming digital assets offer to casino-related transactions, and the reason behind their popularity is evident.&nbsp;</p><p>The advancements brought by these tokens are nothing short of impressive. But another iGaming crypto is pushing the boundaries even further.</p><h2>Introduction to TFS Token</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://bonafides.club/66134/787?l=3692&amp;utm_medium=2450&amp;param1=cryptonews&amp;param2=article&amp;param3=fix&amp;param4=2023-06">TFS Token</a> is native to the Fairspin casino and creates revolutionary reward-generating capabilities.</p><p>Obviously, it is underpinned by blockchain tenets like its iGaming counterparts and any cryptocurrency in general, making the rewarding mechanisms at Fairspin transparent.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/117764/314362/tfs-token.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/117764/314362/responsive-images/tfs-token___media_library_original_1758_619.jpg 1758w, https://cimg.co/news/117764/314362/responsive-images/tfs-token___media_library_original_1200_423.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/117764/314362/responsive-images/tfs-token___media_library_original_900_317.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/117764/314362/responsive-images/tfs-token___media_library_original_720_254.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/117764/314362/responsive-images/tfs-token___media_library_original_600_211.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/117764/314362/responsive-images/tfs-token___media_library_original_300_106.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1758" class="content-img"></figure><p>The token helps overcome shady practices employed by fraudulent casinos to cheat players out of their gains.&nbsp;</p><p>Transparency aside, TFS also enables users to tap into DeFi-related yields, bringing unique earning possibilities that other tokens are not.</p><p><a href="https://fairspin.io/">Fairspin</a> gamblers earn TFS as rewards within the Play to Earn program. All they have to do is place bets in any game hosted at the casino.&nbsp;</p><p>And such rakeback is received for both winning and losing bets, Moreover, players can instantly move it from the platform to their wallets.</p><p>TFS Token is not only offered as a reward to gamblers but can also be used to earn more. That is how the other Fairspin loyalty programs operate.&nbsp;</p><p>On that line, the Hold to Earn program allows users to put their TFS to work and generate huge returns. They can stake their TFS for three different periods &ndash; eight hours, one day, or three days.&nbsp;</p><p>The casino holders&rsquo; average APR is a whopping 535%, whereas daily APR offerings can reach 23%, besting the returns offered by other iGaming tokens by a mile.</p><p>There is also a Liquidity Staking program that allows users to hold TFS for an indefinite period and withdraw their rewards anytime.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, TFS is staked alongside USDT in the TFS/USDT pool, boosting the liquidity within the pool. Stakers can hold their funds as long as they wish.&nbsp;</p><p>The longer, the better, as yields increase with the staking period. The returns maximize at the 30-day mark, allowing users to capitalize the most from the casino GGR.</p><p>The ingenious reward-generating mechanism of <a href="https://bonafides.club/66134/787?l=3692&amp;utm_medium=2450&amp;param1=cryptonews&amp;param2=article&amp;param3=fix&amp;param4=2023-06">TFS Token</a> is one of the main reasons Fairspin is rising to the top of the iGaming space.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the TFS dominance within the online casino landscape does not stop there. It boasts several other characteristics that make it even more attractive to crypto users.</p><p>For instance, the reliability of TFS is guaranteed by the Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain networks, owing to it being an ERC-20/BEP-20 token. Thus, it can store, transact, and trade value safely.&nbsp;</p><p>TFS breaks out of being just another iGaming asset. And Fairspin, establishing itself as a leading crypto casino, gives impetus to its token&rsquo;s price, making TFS a safe crypto for various purposes.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>TFS Token is a prime choice to acquire, whether one is a gambling enthusiast or not &#8211; its powerful utility and tokenomics, the innovative reward-bearing mechanisms surrounding it, and the massive casino it calls home make it one of the most promising crypto assets presently.&nbsp;</p><p>Obtaining TFS allows one to leverage high-return loyalty programs and profit outside playing at Fairspin &ndash; the token&rsquo;s massive potential for growth should place it on every crypto user&rsquo;s radar.</p><p>Want to secure <a href="https://bonafides.club/66134/787?l=3692&amp;utm_medium=2450&amp;param1=cryptonews&amp;param2=article&amp;param3=fix&amp;param4=2023-06">TFS Tokens</a> for their array of merits? Acquiring them is just a swap away on DEXs.</p><p>Otherwise, try gambling at <a href="https://fairspin.io/">Fairspin</a> to get TFS rakeback. Get the crypto and tap into unparalleled earnings.</p>

In November last year, the SEC won a case against LBRY Credits, with the judge ruling that the LBC token was an investment contract. However, in a recent win for the LBRY community, the judge clarified that the ruling did not include secondary market sales.</p><h2>LBRY Credits makes a major win against the SEC</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Attorney John Deaton has settled a debate eminent in the LBRY vs. SEC lawsuit. The ruling made in favor of the SEC in November could have given the regulatory body legitimacy over the secondary cryptocurrency market.

At the time of writing, TWT was trading at $2.27 after a 7.5% gain in 24 hours. The token is also up 92% over the past week.</p><h2>TWT price analysis</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>TWT has been one of the greatest gainers over the past week. The token has been performing contrary to the rest of the market, which is still being battered by the demise of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-used-10-billion-of-customer-funds-prop-up-alameda-research-lost-it-all-what-happens-next.htm">FTX cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p><p>Amid the recent price rally, TWT has already reached a new all-time high. The token reached an all-time high of $2.71 before retreating slightly to the current levels. The current buyer support could see the token creating new record highs again.</p><p>In the last 24 hours, TWT has moved between the $1.83 and $2.71 levels, indicating high volatility. The TWT rally is attracting much attention, as seen in the token&rsquo;s trading volumes of over $820 million in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Following the recent gains, the TWT market cap is also rising, and it currently stands at $933 billion, according to CoinGecko, ranking it as the 45<sup>th</sup> largest cryptocurrency by this metric. As the price continues to gain as the rest of the market struggles, it is likely that TWT will continue to rise in the market cap ranks.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/94678/236322/fireshot-capture-004-twtusdt-2-3611-22-76-unnamed.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/94678/236322/responsive-images/fireshot-capture-004-twtusdt-2-3611-22-76-unnamed___media_library_original_1510_804.jpg 1510w, https://cimg.co/news/94678/236322/responsive-images/fireshot-capture-004-twtusdt-2-3611-22-76-unnamed___media_library_original_1200_639.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/94678/236322/responsive-images/fireshot-capture-004-twtusdt-2-3611-22-76-unnamed___media_library_original_900_479.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/94678/236322/responsive-images/fireshot-capture-004-twtusdt-2-3611-22-76-unnamed___media_library_original_720_383.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/94678/236322/responsive-images/fireshot-capture-004-twtusdt-2-3611-22-76-unnamed___media_library_original_600_319.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/94678/236322/responsive-images/fireshot-capture-004-twtusdt-2-3611-22-76-unnamed___media_library_original_300_160.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1510" class="content-img"></figure><p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) movement shows a massive drop in buying pressure. After a new all-time high was hit, traders have been selling the token, explaining the drop from $2.71 to the current price. The RSI at 39 shows that the token is heading toward an oversold level, hinting that the trend will reverse. If TWT breaks past $2.71 again, the next target price will be $3.</p><h2>Growing demand for self-custody wallets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>TWT has been gaining amid a growing demand for wallet storage following the collapse of FTX. The FTX exchange has already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, with billions of user funds still locked in the exchange.</p><p>The demise of FTX is not the first failure of a crypto firm this year. Users suffered similar losses after Celsius and Voyager collapsed, raising concerns about the security of funds stored on exchanges. Users are now rushing to withdraw their tokens from exchanges to store them in wallets such as Trust.</p><p>Trust is a wallet created by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/">Binance exchange</a>. Unlike storing funds on exchanges, wallets allow a user to be in full control of their funds. The main risk of storing crypto on wallets is forgetting the private key or phishing campaigns.</p><p>Trust Wallet supports 8 million crypto assets, including non-fungible tokens. It does not only support funds from Binance but also other exchanges. TWT is the native token for the Trust Wallet, with the growing use of this wallet translating to significant gains for the token. Therefore, it is likely that TWT will continue rallying.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/"><strong>Visit Dash 2 Trade Now</strong></a></p>

The token benefited from last week&rsquo;s volatility which saw most of the market make some gains. Over the past week, AVAX is up by 18.6%, but as the bearish momentum takes shape, these gains could likely be erased.</p><h2>Avalanche price forecast</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>AVAX is losing its weekly uptrend momentum. The recent gains rallied the token from $16 to $19. However, this uptrend has weakened, and the token is falling again, with $15 being the likely outcome as the market adjusts after the interest rate hike expected to happen on Wednesday after this month&rsquo;s FOMC meeting.</p><p>Even though the price is correcting, investors anticipate that this token could rally higher in the long term, after which a rally to $20 could be on the way. AVAX trading volumes in the past 24 hours stand at over $457 million. Such gains will most likely be attributed to the growing adoption of the network by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-apps.htm">best crypto apps</a>.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/93182/232901/avalanche-price-forecast.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/93182/232901/responsive-images/avalanche-price-forecast___media_library_original_929_400.jpg 929w, https://cimg.co/news/93182/232901/responsive-images/avalanche-price-forecast___media_library_original_900_388.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/93182/232901/responsive-images/avalanche-price-forecast___media_library_original_720_310.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/93182/232901/responsive-images/avalanche-price-forecast___media_library_original_600_258.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/93182/232901/responsive-images/avalanche-price-forecast___media_library_original_300_129.jpg 300w" width="929" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>The Relative Strength Index at 43 shows that AVAX is leaning more towards being oversold, which is a bullish outlook.

This presents a buying opportunity for traders anticipating that the token will achieve a bullish momentum. However, a bull run for AVAX largely depends on how the broader cryptocurrency market performs.</p><p>Traders looking to make significant gains in the short term should consider diversifying their portfolio into new cryptocurrencies. Presales are historically lucrative to early investors, and one of the best presales happening right now is Dash 2 Trade.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/">Dash 2 Trade</a> is a crypto analytics and intelligence platform for new and expert traders.

The rate at which the presale is selling out is attracting the attention of cryptocurrency investors globally.

The meme coin is one of the top gainers among the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Over the past week, SHIB has gained by around 22%.</p><h2>Shiba Inu price analysis</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Shiba Inu is following a similar trend seen with most meme coins over the past few days. Meme coins have had a hard time dealing with the bear market this year, but the notable price gains seen during the past day have led to some losses being recovered.</p><p>In the last 24 hours, SHIB traded between $0.0000107 and $0.00001270. SHIB&rsquo;s trading volumes have increased substantially to $1.4 billion during this time. The bullish sentiment across the broader market could see an influx of buyers pushing SHIB&rsquo;s price higher.</p><p>If SHIB maintains the rally, it could likely test the resistance at $0.00002. The meme coin community is currently actively buying because of the news of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter. If this bullish sentiment continues being in play amid an FOMC rally, SHIB could continue recording double-digit gains in the coming days.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92839/232170/shiba-inu.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92839/232170/responsive-images/shiba-inu___media_library_original_928_402.jpg 928w, https://cimg.co/news/92839/232170/responsive-images/shiba-inu___media_library_original_900_390.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/92839/232170/responsive-images/shiba-inu___media_library_original_720_312.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92839/232170/responsive-images/shiba-inu___media_library_original_600_260.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92839/232170/responsive-images/shiba-inu___media_library_original_300_130.jpg 300w" width="928" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p>Shiba Inu has a Relative Strength Index of 54, which places the meme coin in neither the overbought nor the oversold territory. The notable gains made during the past 24 hours have not influenced a lot of buying pressure, which raises the chances of the current bull run being sustained.</p><p>Crypto analysts have also gone bullish on SHIB. Gigantic rebirth, one of the analysts that predicted Bitcoin&rsquo;s last ATH and the crash of Terra, predicts that SHIB will rally higher as the DOGE/SHIB trading pair reverses. The DOGE/SHIB pair has been strong amid a notable pump in the largest meme coin.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And with this I am long a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SHIB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SHIB</a>.<br><br>How could you not when GCR tips his hand? <a href="https://t.co/MlI7Niug0j">https://t.co/MlI7Niug0j</a></p>&mdash; HORSE (@TheFlowHorse) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheFlowHorse/status/1586038870755266560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>This meme coin could rally 10x</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>If you are buying SHIB, you might also look into Tamadoge (TAMA).

TAMA has gained 1.4% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.0232 at the time of writing.</p><p>Tamadoge recently launched a new non-fungible token (NFT) drop on OpenSea comprising 20,000 Tamadoge NFTs. The NFTs allow players to interact in the soon-to-be-launched Tamaverse.</p><h2>New cryptos to consider buying</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>If you want to diversify your portfolio beyond meme coins, you should consider participating in some of the best presales that could deliver major gains.</p><p>One of these presales is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/">Dash 2 Trade</a>. Dash 2 Trade is a crypto signals platform based on the Ethereum blockchain.

Here are the 4 best cryptocurrencies to buy today, October 27th.</p><h3>IMPT</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/">IMPT</a> is an interesting asset poised to deliver excellent gains to investors. It has already generated a significant amount of attention from investors, and it could easily be a major hit in the market.</p><p>The project calls itself the greenest cryptocurrency, and its idea is to use the power of blockchain to combat climate change. It was launched earlier this year on Ethereum, and it allows users to buy carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint and fund eco-sustainability projects around the globe.</p><p>The project is holding a presale right now, with a goal of selling 1.2 billion IMPT. So far, it has sold about half of that amount &mdash; 610 million, raising over $11 million along the way.</p><h3>DOGE</h3><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92534/231730/doge.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92534/231730/responsive-images/doge___media_library_original_902_571.jpg 902w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231730/responsive-images/doge___media_library_original_900_570.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231730/responsive-images/doge___media_library_original_720_456.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231730/responsive-images/doge___media_library_original_600_380.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231730/responsive-images/doge___media_library_original_300_190.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="902" class="content-img"></figure><p>Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that needs no special introduction. It was created in 2013 as a joke &mdash; a meme coin, and somehow, it managed not only to survive for almost 10 years, but also to thrive and become one of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. In the past 24 hours, the token has seen its price skyrocket by almost 15%, going from $0.066 to $0.080. Since then, it has dropped slightly to $0.076, where it sits at the time of writing, although its price is showing signs of recovery once again.</p><p>The token might be surging due to Elon Musk, one of its biggest promoters, who entered Twitter HQ yesterday, carrying a kitchen sink to signal &ldquo;moving in,&rdquo; after completing the purchase of the network.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! <a href="https://t.co/D68z4K2wq7">pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Interestingly Elon Musk <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-prices-dump-pump-cpi-day-elon-musk-bitcoin-call.htm">predicted Bitcoin would hit $20,000</a> over a week ago on October 13th, on CPI day.</p><h3>D2T</h3><p>Another new project that is holding a presale right now is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/">Dash 2 Trade (D2T)</a>. The project aims to offer all the tools that a crypto trader/investor would need to make educated decisions and handle the market with the best possible results. It can offer trading signals, price predictions, social analytics, exchange listing notifications, notifications involving various community events, and more.</p><p>It already has 70,000 people in its community, which is about the following of Learn 2 Trade, a platform that launched the project. So far, it has raised over $2.7 million by selling D2T tokens, only taking 3 days to hit $1m, which indicates that these tokens are disappearing quickly.</p><h3>KLAY</h3><p>Finally, we recommend Klaytn, which is a public blockchain focused on the metaverse and GameFi. Klaytn recently made headlines by overtaking even DOGE in the race for being the most profitable crypto by 44%. Its price went from $0.1245 on October 21st to $0.2469 earlier today.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92534/231735/klay.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92534/231735/responsive-images/klay___media_library_original_906_568.jpg 906w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231735/responsive-images/klay___media_library_original_900_564.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231735/responsive-images/klay___media_library_original_720_451.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231735/responsive-images/klay___media_library_original_600_376.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92534/231735/responsive-images/klay___media_library_original_300_188.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="906" class="content-img"></figure><p>In the last 24 hours alone, the project has skyrocketed by over 23%, and for the time being, its price only continues to rapidly climb, making it the most profitable crypto to hold right now.</p><h2>Alternative investment: RIA</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Another project from the GameFi sector that many might be interested in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/calvaria/">Calvaria (RIA)</a>, which is currently holding a presale as well. The project is a P2E battle card game that allows players to duel, earn, and upgrade their cards, all of which feature impressive and beautiful designs. The goal, of course, is to become the dominant force on the battlefield and beat all who stand in your way.</p><p>Right now, 1 USDT is capable of buying you 66.67 RIA tokens, and the project has already sold more than half of them, raising $366,244 in the process. Anyone wishing to join the presale needs to hurry, as the tokens are being purchased rapidly, and chances are that they will not be available for much longer.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/"><strong><u>Visit Dash 2 Trade Now</u></strong></a></p>

While a fairly low increase, it is still notable, as it suggests that the project might be recovering, especially after recent news involving a 4-year plan to bring back value to the token.</p><p>However, the increase was then suddenly interrupted, possibly by the recent development that has seen the minting of 200 million LUNC.</p><h2>Terra sees the minting of 200m LUNC</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The surprise comes due to the fact that Terra Classic is now trying to burn LUNC tokens in order to reduce the supply. And yet, on October 26th, the community was confused after seeing a green candle emerge on StakeBin, indicating that someone minted around 173 million LUNC.</p><p>The explanation came quickly after members of Terra Rebels, a developer team supporting the Terra Classic chain, clarified that the new LUNC came from the community&rsquo;s approval of the recent proposal 5234.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/o4yqjAzDas">pic.twitter.com/o4yqjAzDas</a></p>&mdash; Tobias Andersen (@ZaradarBH) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZaradarBH/status/1585314705111146496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>As it turns out, the community was warned that something like this might happen, and they were instructed not to panic, as it is an expected possibility.</p><h2>Terra becomes the most searched cryptocurrency in 14 US states</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Another surprising development for Terra came from Google data, compiled and reported by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thefintechtimes.com/terra-luna-has-more-searches-in-more-states-than-ethereum-as-top-crypto-for-each-state-revealed/">Fintech Times</a>.

That includes things like trading signals, social analytics, exchange listing alerts, user trading competitions, and more.</p><p>The project was created by Learn 2 Trade, which is a crypto-learning platform with a community that numbers over 70,000 members. D2T is also holding a presale right now, which offers D2T tokens at a price of 0.0513 USDT per token. The project has already raised over $2.7 million, with a goal of hitting $5.16 million.

However, in recent weeks and even months, most of the crypto market has been struggling to shake off the bears and grow again. Chia, however, has had less success in this field, and even in the last three months, the token saw almost no attempts at recovery; it just kept sinking deeper and deeper to the current price of $31.58.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92529/231715/22.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92529/231715/responsive-images/22___media_library_original_911_568.jpg 911w, https://cimg.co/news/92529/231715/responsive-images/22___media_library_original_900_561.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/92529/231715/responsive-images/22___media_library_original_720_449.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92529/231715/responsive-images/22___media_library_original_600_374.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92529/231715/responsive-images/22___media_library_original_300_187.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="911" class="content-img"></figure><p>With that being the case, many are calling it a dead altcoin, and investors are looking toward new, more promising alternatives.</p><h3>Dash 2 Trade (D2T)</h3><p>The first altcoin to consider is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/">Dash 2 Trade (D2T)</a>, currently in the middle of a presale, stage 2. The project is a native cryptocurrency of a Dash 2 Trade platform, which provides crypto trading signals, social analytics, predictions, and alike, all of which are dedicated to helping traders make the best trading decisions on the market.</p><p>The project already has over 70,000 traders, and, as mentioned, it is in the middle of a presale with the goal of raising $5,166,000. So far, it has managed to raise about half of that amount, of $2,721,120.5 in USDT. Users can purchase 1 D2T token for 0.0513 USDT, and at the time of writing, there are only 48.8 million D2T tokens remaining.&nbsp;</p><p>The project has raised its first $1 million in less than three days, so anyone who wants to join the presale is advised to do it quickly before the second half of the tokens is sold.<br><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/"><strong><u>Visit Dash 2 Trade Now</u></strong></a></p><h3>IMPT (IMPT)</h3><p>Another alternative worth considering is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/">IMPT</a>, which calls itself the greenest cryptocurrency, and is dedicated to helping the fight against climate change. The Ethereum-based platform and token are using blockchain technology to push this goal by allowing companies and individuals to purchase carbon credits that can help them offset their own carbon footprints.</p><p>IMPT is also holding a presale right now, where each token can be purchased with USDT at a price of $0.023 per 1 IMPT. So far, the project has sold 609 million tokens out of 1.26 billion in total, and it raised slightly over $11 million out of a $25.9 million goal.&nbsp;</p><p>By investing, anyone can become a part of a large ecosystem that connects socially responsible brands with businesses and individuals who wish to help save the environment, which is definitely a goal worth pursuing.<br><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/"><strong><u>Visit IMPT Now</u></strong></a></p><h3>Calvaria (RIA)</h3><p>Finally, there is a project called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/calvaria/">Calvaria (RIA)</a>, which is a P2E battle card game set beyond the veil of death, as its platform says. It allows users to engage in duels against other players, earn tokens for winning, and upgrade their cards to become the best player on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p><p>All the cards feature beautiful, highly detailed designs, and the project is developing deep and complex lore for the world of its game, to the great pleasure of card game fans.</p><p>As for RIA itself, it is in the middle of a presale, as mentioned, where players can purchase 66.67 RIA per USDT. So far, the project has raised 47% of its goal, which is 356,192 USDT out of 750k in total. It sold 33.7 million RIA, so anyone who wishes to get some of these coins should hurry.<br><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/calvaria/"><strong><u>Visit Calvaria Now</u></strong></a></p><h2>The biggest potential in the market?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While all three altcoins are worth investors&rsquo; attention, D2T seems to be among the most popular options, indicating that it might see the greatest potential to help investors earn from engaging with it.&nbsp;</p><p>The project supplies investors and traders with exchange listing notifications, user trading competitions, trading signals, on-chain analytics, and more &mdash; including everything that traders could ever need in order to tackle the market, no matter how it changes.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/"><strong><u>Visit Dash 2 Trade Now</u></strong></a></p>

During the same time, many altcoins have traded in the green zone, with Ethereum making double-digit gains.</p><p>However, SOL has failed to register major gains, as seen in the token trading between $30 and $32, indicating low volatility. The trend made by SOL is different from the one seen with most of the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>During the past 24 hours, SOL has reported trading volumes of around $1.44 billion, representing a 42% increase over the past day. This is a healthy volume, showing that traders are interested in the token.</p><p>SOL currently ranks as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of over $11 billion. If SOL can mimic the performance of the broader cryptocurrency market and rallies, it could test the next level at $35 before dashing for $40.</p><p>SOL registered a solid bullish rally in November last year when it reached an all-time high of $259. However, the token has since dropped from these levels by around 88% amid the bearish trend seen for most of this year.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92386/231357/solana-price-prediction.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92386/231357/responsive-images/solana-price-prediction___media_library_original_938_427.jpg 938w, https://cimg.co/news/92386/231357/responsive-images/solana-price-prediction___media_library_original_900_410.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/92386/231357/responsive-images/solana-price-prediction___media_library_original_720_328.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92386/231357/responsive-images/solana-price-prediction___media_library_original_600_273.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92386/231357/responsive-images/solana-price-prediction___media_library_original_300_137.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="938" class="content-img"></figure><p>The technical indicators show that SOL could be headed toward a trend reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the token is in the overbought zone, indicating that a reversal could be on the way.</p><p>The movement of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line also shows that the trend is bullish. The MACD line is above the signal line, which could be attributed to the slight gains that SOL has made after the broader cryptocurrency market rallied.</p><p>If the bullish trend emerges to be strong, SOL could be headed toward $50. However, the crypto market has been trading sideways over the last few weeks, indicating that the current trend could also reverse. This could lead to SOL dropping below $30K if the bearish trend is strong enough.</p><h2>New cryptos make major gains</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As Solana trades sideways, some new cryptocurrencies are attracting attention and could lead to 10X gains in the short term.

ETH is now on the way to breaking past the psychological level of $2,000.</p><p>The cryptocurrency market has traded in the green zone over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has managed to break past $20K for the first time since October 7, and altcoins are also rallying as traders take advantage of the spike in volatility.</p><p>In the last 24 hours, Ether has traded between $1,378 to $1,543, indicating high volatility. ETH&rsquo;s trading volumes stand at $27.44 billion after triple-digit gains over the past day. Ethereum&rsquo;s market cap is at $184 billion, with a market dominance of 17.83%.</p><p>Like most large-cap cryptocurrencies, Ether has been consolidating over the past few weeks, with the prices barely changing as volatility dropped to notably low levels. However, as stock markets rallied yesterday amid the release of earnings reports by tech firms, the crypto market volatility has also increased in response.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92383/231355/ethereum-price-analysis.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92383/231355/responsive-images/ethereum-price-analysis___media_library_original_1862_794.jpg 1862w, https://cimg.co/news/92383/231355/responsive-images/ethereum-price-analysis___media_library_original_1200_512.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/92383/231355/responsive-images/ethereum-price-analysis___media_library_original_900_384.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/92383/231355/responsive-images/ethereum-price-analysis___media_library_original_720_307.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92383/231355/responsive-images/ethereum-price-analysis___media_library_original_600_256.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92383/231355/responsive-images/ethereum-price-analysis___media_library_original_300_128.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1862" class="content-img"></figure><p>The technical indicators prove that ETH is indeed in bullish territory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI0 is at 59, showing that the token is leaning toward the overbought zone. The buying pressure witnessed over the past 24 hours could have created this trend. On the other hand, the RSI level does not show a high risk of a trend reversal.</p><p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is also in the bullish zone, indicating that Ether could continue gaining. If the rally is sustained, a push to $1,550 is likely, after which the price could gain to $1,750.</p><p>On the other hand, the buying pressure could be exhausted if the macroeconomic factors attributed to the recent rally are no longer in play. If the price of ETH retraces, the token will drop to $1,460, and the token could test lower support levels at $1,360.</p><h2>Diversify your portfolio with these altcoins</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Presales are usually a good way to diversify your crypto portfolio.

LUNC has been seeing price drops throughout October, but this might change moving forward.</p><p>At the time of writing, the token&rsquo;s price is $0.000234, and while this is far from its lowest point, it might be its new bottom.</p><h2>Terra Classic community reduced tax burn to 0.2%</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Following the crash of the Terra blockchain back in May of this year, the project saw a hard fork that split it into two. The original Terra blockchain was renamed to Terra Classic, with its native token becoming Luna Classic (LUNC).</p><p>After the token&rsquo;s crash, a large portion of the community simply abandoned the project. Those who remained, however, decided to start over, and now, they are doing everything in their power to bring LUNC back to greatness. One part of that includes token burning that Binance has been conducting, as the exchange and the project agreed to burn 1.2% of each transaction as a type of tax.</p><p>Token burning will reduce the circulating supply and bring value back to the coin through its own scarcity. However, after a recent community vote, it was decided that the tax rate would be reduced from 1.2% to 0.2% since the earlier rate was believed to be causing a decline in the network activity, according to Binance&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.binance.com/en/news/top/7243061">announcement</a>.</p><p>So far, Binance has burned over 19.22 billion LUNC, with 4.39 billion burned only two weeks ago. Some have estimated that Binance&rsquo;s burning program would lead to 1 trillion LUNC burned per year by the exchange alone, even if the amount set to be burned was only 0.1% of each transaction.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With this volume &#39;if&#39; the fees sent to burn were 0.1%.

However, there are those who believe that it remains a good project, and they are ready to work on its revival.</p><p>Its developers recently unveiled a 4-year plan to revive the LUNA ecosystem, called the Terra Expedition. According to the proposal, &ldquo;The Terra Expedition is a 4-year program aimed at growing the Terra ecosystem through a series of initiatives with 3 main objectives, namely: Incentivising developers to build on Terra, Deepening liquidity on Terra, and Onboarding users to Terra.&rdquo;</p><h2>Luna Classic price prediction</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>So far, the news has not done much good to the LUNC price. The price did see a small rally yesterday, October 23rd, when it went from $0.0002267 to $0.0002441, but since then, it has corrected again to $0.000232, where it sits at the time of writing.</p><p>&nbsp;<img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92036/230374/luna-classic-price-prediction.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92036/230374/responsive-images/luna-classic-price-prediction___media_library_original_893_569.jpg 893w, https://cimg.co/news/92036/230374/responsive-images/luna-classic-price-prediction___media_library_original_720_458.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92036/230374/responsive-images/luna-classic-price-prediction___media_library_original_600_382.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92036/230374/responsive-images/luna-classic-price-prediction___media_library_original_300_191.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="893" class="content-img"></p><p>Analysts believe that the project has a long way to go even to return to the pre-crash levels, and the fact that it lost almost all of its value within 48 hours says a lot about the decline in the investors&rsquo; trust and confidence levels. The last few months have brought both spikes and plunges, and it is worth noting that there is still a major question about the project&rsquo;s original co-founder, Do Kwon, who is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-prosecutors-do-kwon-left-singapore-for-dubai-last-month.htm">believed to be on the run from the authorities.</a></p><p>LUNC developers and the community are now trying to raise value through token burns and sound planning, which includes building utility and gaining back the trust of investors.</p><h2>Dash 2 Trade offering quicker returns?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>For those traders that maybe can&#8217;t wait another few months for big gains, there are a number of smaller altcoins that have been beating the market in recent weeks, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tamadoge-price-blasts-up-235-as-ultra-rare-auction-launches-best-new-nft-drop.htm">presale tokens proving particularly lucrative</a>.</p><p>One promising ongoing presale is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-dash-2-trade-token.htm"><strong>Dash 2 Trade</strong></a><strong> </strong>&ndash; a crypto analytics and intelligence platform for traders and investors.

However, there are indications that ADA could see a massive 45% rally as the week progresses due to a recent announcement by Cardano&rsquo;s Charles Hoskinson, who hinted at &ldquo;something big&rdquo; coming in November.</p><h2>FTX intends to add spot Cardano (ADA) pair</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of one of the largest global crypto exchanges, FTX, recently responded to a tweet that said that FTX won&rsquo;t list ADA because they view Cardano as a &ldquo;threat to everything they want to control.&rdquo; Bankman-Fried decided to handle the matter personally responding that this is &ldquo;definitely not the case,&rdquo; and adding that ADA is already listed on the exchange internationally.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92033/230371/sbf-on-twitter-at-lucidcic-definitely-not-the-case-we-have-https-t-co-mst1xoz1mv-listed-internati.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92033/230371/responsive-images/sbf-on-twitter-at-lucidcic-definitely-not-the-case-we-have-https-t-co-mst1xoz1mv-listed-internati___media_library_original_589_658.jpg 589w, https://cimg.co/news/92033/230371/responsive-images/sbf-on-twitter-at-lucidcic-definitely-not-the-case-we-have-https-t-co-mst1xoz1mv-listed-internati___media_library_original_300_335.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="589" class="content-img"></figure><p>Furthermore, he added that adding spot ADA is on the platform&rsquo;s roadmap, as well. The revelation was posted yesterday, and it seemingly gave a boost to Cardano&rsquo;s price which started seeing a small correction at the time.</p><p>For the time being, FTX currently offers perpetual futures tied to Cardano, and they are, as its CEO noted, available to international users. And, while Cardano is the only coin of the exchange&rsquo;s top 25 listed currencies without a spot listing, this will reportedly change soon.</p><h2>Charles Hoskinson: Something special is coming in November</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In the past 12 months, Cardano has seen a great amount of growth as a network. After launching smart contracts and concluding its Shelley Era, the project has seen the launch of countless projects in search of a reliable, scalable network to call home. Input Output, a research and development company that uses blockchain technology&rsquo;s P2P innovation to build accessible financial services, recently posted a development update on Cardano, showing some of the highlights of the project.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92033/230372/input-output-on-twitter-icymi-our-weekly-cardano-development-update-is-live-on-essentialcardano.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92033/230372/responsive-images/input-output-on-twitter-icymi-our-weekly-cardano-development-update-is-live-on-essentialcardano___media_library_original_590_672.jpg 590w, https://cimg.co/news/92033/230372/responsive-images/input-output-on-twitter-icymi-our-weekly-cardano-development-update-is-live-on-essentialcardano___media_library_original_300_341.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="590" class="content-img"></figure><p>The report includes over 100 projects launched on Cardano, more than 6.4 million native tokens, 52.4 million transactions, 1,122 additional projects that are building on Cardano right now, and more.</p><p>However, that is not the end for Cardano, as its founder, Charles Hoskinson, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/CardanoFeed/status/1584207512030453760">hinted </a>recently that something big is coming in November. He did not give any details about what or when other than that it will happen next month and that it will be really special for Cardano.</p><h2>Cardano NFT volume surges by over 300%</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Another big development for Cardano concerns its NFT sector. Recent reports have shown that Cardano&rsquo;s trading volume &mdash; a metric used to measure the total number of NFTs being traded in a marketplace &mdash; has seen considerable growth in October after seeing low levels between June and the end of September.</p><p>On October 14th, the metric&rsquo;s value <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://opencnft.io/market-overview">climbed up</a> to 943k ADA, but by October 22nd, it skyrocketed to over 4 million ADA, which represents a 320% surge.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/92033/230369/cardano-nft-volume-surges-by-over-300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/92033/230369/responsive-images/cardano-nft-volume-surges-by-over-300___media_library_original_748_814.jpg 748w, https://cimg.co/news/92033/230369/responsive-images/cardano-nft-volume-surges-by-over-300___media_library_original_720_783.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/92033/230369/responsive-images/cardano-nft-volume-surges-by-over-300___media_library_original_600_652.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/92033/230369/responsive-images/cardano-nft-volume-surges-by-over-300___media_library_original_300_326.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="748" class="content-img"></figure><h2>Cardano price prediction</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>According to a recent study conducted by Santiment, Cardano is currently extremely undervalued. The value of the coin right now is comparatively lower in comparison to the same period in 2019. In fact, the MVRV Z-Score is at -1.35, which puts it at the lowest position it has seen in the last 45 months.</p><p>According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, ADA value is at $0.3609, which puts it at 3.10% higher than 24 hours ago. The project&rsquo;s 24h volume is at $403.02 million, which is around $60 million higher than yesterday during the same period.</p><p>The project has seen quite a significant amount of development, but despite that, holders did not see a significant upward trend since November 2021. In order to return to its pre-ATH value of 2021, Cardano would have to see an 88% rally. While this might not happen in the near future, experts do expect to see a rally that is about half of that, or 45%, as the week unfolds; not only because of Hoskinson&rsquo;s announcement but also due to Cardano, alongside Bitcoin, XRP, and BNB, flashing bullish signals, as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1582967005535092736">reported </a>by Santiment.</p><h2>Alternative Coins &#8211;&nbsp; D2T Presale</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Another project that is important to mention is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/">Dash 2 Trade (D2T)</a> &mdash; a growing, cutting-edge crypto market platform dedicated to research and analytics. The platform was developed by Learn 2 Trade, which features the largest crypto-learning community in the world, containing over 70,000 members.</p><p>The platform offers everything that traders could ever need in order to accurately monitor the market in real time, including on-chain analytics, trading signals, notifications involving exchange listings, trading competitions, and more.</p><p>D2T is currently in the middle of a presale that has already raised over $1 million in less than 3 days since the start, and is currently nearing its second million, sitting at $1,937,460.4 USDT raised at the time of writing. The goal of the presale is to raise $5.166 million, and presently, only 64,570,792 D2T tokens remain.</p>

These cryptos include Ripple (XRP), Terra USD Classic (USTC), Tamadoge (TAMA), and the Impact Project (IMPT).</p><h2>XRP</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>XRP has plunged by 6.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $0.456 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. XRP&#8217;s current pullback is erasing the coin&#8217;s gains over the last few weeks. XRP&#8217;s recent rally has gained 26% over the past month.</p><p>XRP&#8217;s trading volumes during the past 24 hours stand at $1.69 billion, showing high investor interest in the token. The bearish sentiment across the broader market could see XRP record a selloff that will drop prices to $0.42. The bearish thesis will be invalidated if XRP can gain past $0.53.</p><p>The release of the US CPI data is expected to see a price breakdown, and the price is more likely to retrace. Nevertheless, the news could ignite a rally if the data is positive.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90753/227287/ripple-xrp.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90753/227287/responsive-images/ripple-xrp___media_library_original_1860_795.jpg 1860w, https://cimg.co/news/90753/227287/responsive-images/ripple-xrp___media_library_original_1200_512.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/90753/227287/responsive-images/ripple-xrp___media_library_original_900_384.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90753/227287/responsive-images/ripple-xrp___media_library_original_720_307.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90753/227287/responsive-images/ripple-xrp___media_library_original_600_256.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90753/227287/responsive-images/ripple-xrp___media_library_original_300_128.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1860" class="content-img"></figure><h2>Terra USD Classic (USTC)</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>USTC seems to be losing the bullish momentum that it has commanded over the past few days. CoinGecko shows that USTC has increased by around 65% over the past week. The coin&#8217;s recent rally fuelled speculation about whether USTC will repeg back to the dollar.</p><p>At the time of writing, USTC was trading at $0.0495 after a 3.7% decline over the last 24 hours. The decline reflects the trend across the broader cryptocurrency market. The rally witnessed over the past week saw USTC reach $0.062, but it is now retracing from these levels.</p><p>USTC seems to be losing the support of buyers, and the selling pressure could see the coin dropping to $0.038 while bulls could push prices to $0.060.

The uptrend comes amid a slight recovery in the global cryptocurrency market. The overall crypto market has risen by 0.7% in 24 hours, but it is yet to hit the $1 trillion mark.</p><h2>Can LUFC rally to $10?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The LUFC token has been having a hard time making a price recovery despite the English Premier League kicking off the latest season. Over the last 30 days, this token has declined by around 22%.</p><p>LUFC, like most of the altcoins, has been battered by the ongoing bear market. The token has dropped by around 92% since reaching an all-time high in December 2021. The token has been testing lower lows this year, and rallies have been limited.</p><p>The recent plunge could attract last year&#8217;s profit takers that want to buy the token at low prices, which begs the question of whether this token could rally to $10. This would be difficult to achieve in the current market however, should prices pick back up again, then it may be possible.<br><br><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/90640/227164/screenshot-2022-10-12-at-17-53-58.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/90640/227164/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-10-12-at-17-53-58___media_library_original_1668_922.jpg 1668w, https://cimg.co/news/90640/227164/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-10-12-at-17-53-58___media_library_original_1200_663.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/90640/227164/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-10-12-at-17-53-58___media_library_original_900_497.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/90640/227164/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-10-12-at-17-53-58___media_library_original_720_397.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/90640/227164/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-10-12-at-17-53-58___media_library_original_600_331.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/90640/227164/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-10-12-at-17-53-58___media_library_original_300_165.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1668" class="content-img"></p><p>Over the past day, LUFC has traded within the range of $1.29 and $1.37. The token managed to reach a weekly high of $1.54, but it has since retreated from these levels each time. If the token can sustain the current uptrend, LUFC could break past $1.50 again in the coming days.</p><p>On the other hand, if the broader markets start showing signs of weakness, LUFC could drop from the current level to below $1.20. If this momentum continues, then LUFC below $1 is also likely. The last time that LUFC dropped below $1 was earlier this year when the token plunged to an all-time low of $0.78.</p><p>LUFC is a fan token. Fan tokens such as LUFC have some of the best utility as they allow supporters to have a direct impact on the team they support.
