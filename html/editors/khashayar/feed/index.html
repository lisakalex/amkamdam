Source: CNBC International TV / YouTube</figcaption></figure><p style="text-align:justify;">In an insightful conversation with <i>Cryptonews</i>, Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of both <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/tether/"><strong>Tether</strong></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitfinex/"><strong>Bitfinex</strong></a>, shed light on crucial topics relating to the crypto world.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The dialogue navigated the volatile waters of inflation, the allure of gold as a tangible asset, and the growing fascination with digital gold &ndash; Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Ardoino also explained Tether&#8217;s novel approach toward global transactions and the role of their unique digital gold model.<br><br>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Central Banks Printed 30% of all USD in Circulation in Three Years</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As inflation escalates and national currencies depreciate, &#8220;the only lifeline to have something tangible in your portfolio is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/gold/">gold</a>,&#8221; according to Ardoino.</p><p>This ancient safe haven asset is finding parallels with its digital counterpart, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-significant-drop-of-over-5-raises-concerns-can-btc-find-support-above-24000.htm">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/coronavirus/">COVID-19</a> pandemic and subsequent economic stimulus have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/inflation/">inflated</a> global economies, as a result of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/central-bank/">central banks</a>&#8216; mass money printing.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, a whopping 30% of all USD in circulation was printed in the past three years, Ardoino noted to <i>Cryptonews.com.</i></p><p>Countries like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/turkey/">Turkey</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/argentina/">Argentina</a> are bearing the brunt of this trend, grappling with severe currency devaluations.</p><p>In response, central banks are pivoting to secure assets like gold and, to a lesser extent, Bitcoin.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Gold and Bitcoin as Safe Assets</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Both gold and Bitcoin are seen as scarce, hard-to-extract assets, making them attractive, safe assets.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While central banks have a long history of using gold as a reserve asset, Bitcoin remains less understood, and is harder for these institutions to integrate.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;So what they do in this case is go out and try to buy the safest asset that they can hold in their portfolios, and that is gold.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">The shared characteristics of gold and Bitcoin include their scarcity, as well as the extraction difficulty and the cost of their production.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The largest gold buyers are in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/asia/">Asia</a>, said Ardoino, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/china/">China</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/india/">India</a> leading the way.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;I love the fact that there is a deep connection between gold and digital gold, Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">However, Ardoino stressed,</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;I always try to make the point that Tether Gold is not competing with Bitcoin but with dollars. I personally think that Bitcoin is much better than gold.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, the reality is that Bitcoin needs a currency to trade against.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;So if you are selling your Bitcoin for something else, in my opinion, selling it for gold is better than selling it for dollars.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Shift Toward Digital Gold</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">Globally, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/economic-and-political-factors-behind-acceleration-of-de-dollarization.html">several countries have started seeking an alternative to the US dollar</a> for settling transactions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, accepting foreign currencies for international trade introduces the risk of inflation exposure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Gold may be the solution. It is &ldquo;the only currency that can be understood and could be the common denominator,&rdquo; Tether CTO said.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As physical gold is challenging to move and use in transactions, digital gold is seen as a more practical option.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Stablecoin-issuer, Tether, has created a model for digital gold, called <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-gold-digital-gold-for-the-modern-era/">Tether Gold</a>, that Ardoino believes other countries and organizations could replicate for international trade.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;We believe that this solution can potentially even outgrow USDT.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Tether targeted the crypto industry first with its digital gold, as this sector is best positioned to grasp its purpose.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now, the company is also in talks with hedge funds looking to add Tether Gold to their portfolios.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Tether Gold is designed to play a pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ardoino explained. It would reduce the dependency on USD in lending and borrowing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, he posited, gold trumps fiat currency as a superior DeFi asset.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Regulatory Hurdles and Security Measures</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>On top of regulation, Tether Gold&#8217;s focus is on security and validating the gold that underpins the digital tokens.</p><p>One key security measure is ensuring that the physical gold is stashed in the world&#8217;s safest location.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/switzerland/">Switzerland</a>, renowned for its trustworthiness and neutrality, is the perfect repository for this gold, being an &#8220;agnostic&#8221; nation, Ardoino suggested.</p><p>A comprehensive audit is another crucial step. This entails more than just weighing the gold; sophisticated tools must measure other parameters, including density.</p><p>With the physical and auditing aspects covered, attention then shifts to regulatory matters.</p><p>On the regulatory front, Ardoino confirmed that Tether is collaborating with global regulators to secure licenses and expand.</p><p>In this evolving landscape of Fintech and crypto, the fusion of traditional assets like gold with blockchain technology demonstrates an exciting potential.&nbsp;</p><p>As Tether continues to pioneer this new frontier, the world watches, ready to navigate the uncharted territories of digital gold.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">____</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">Learn more:</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-announces-q1-profit-of-148-billion-discloses-bitcoin-gold-reserves.htm">Tether Announces Q1 Profit of $1.48 Billion and Discloses Bitcoin, Gold Reserves</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-stablecoin-recoups-lost-market-value-2022-crash-topping-832-billion.htm">Tether Stablecoin Recoups Lost Market Value in 2022 Crash, Topping $83.2 Billion</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-plans-bitcoin-mining-uruguay.htm">Tether Plans Bitcoin Mining in Uruguay</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-plans-15-of-its-net-profits-into-bitcoin-move-of-confidence.htm">Tether Plans 15% of Its Net Profits Into Bitcoin in Move of Confidence</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm">What is DeFi?

From MoneyGram&#8217;s perspective, the current events are seen as potentially advantageous.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Maday firmly believes that &#8220;blockchain is here to stay,&#8221; and regulation will inevitably follow, though its exact form remains uncertain.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">He stressed the importance of regulation and protection in the crypto space.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While not elaborating on MoneyGram&#8217;s specific expectations for regulatory direction, Maday commented on the company&#8217;s interaction with regulators, noting that regulations are likely being drafted in response to current market conditions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To illustrate the necessity for regulators, Maday shared a common analogy: &#8220;What allows a car to go fast? Most people say it&#8217;s the engine, the gas, the accelerator. However, it&#8217;s the brakes on the car. Otherwise, we&#8217;d all be driving 5MPH.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Acknowledging the learning curve for all parties involved, Maday added,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a new tech &ndash; we&#8217;re all learning, legislators too, they&#8217;re just humans.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2 style="text-align:justify;">Blockchain Easily Going Where Few Have Gone Before</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">On the global level, the world has been hit by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/pandemic/">COVID-19</a> pandemic, followed by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/russia/">Russian</a> invasion of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, as well as the massive earthquakes in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/turkey/">Turkey</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/syria/">Syria</a>.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This too may have affected crypto adoption for remittance.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Per Maday, the way aid is being delivered to Ukrainian refugees, as well as the earthquake victims, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/">USD coin (USDC)</a> stablecoin, is particularly noteworthy.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re noticing that the usage of USDC as an instrument for aid relief is coming out to be somewhat easier and faster to deliver.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Notably, it is not so much that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/ukraine-war">war in Ukraine</a> is helping this adoption, but that it is hard to deliver aid to certain areas in general, he argued.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">That&rsquo;s why, in the contemporary world, the combination of digital assets and MoneyGram makes it easy to send aid where it would previously have been very difficult to do so.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">What is MoneyGram currently working on when it comes to the crypto space?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p style="text-align:justify;">From a remittance perspective, the trend MoneyGram is trying to follow is use cases around <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/stablecoin/">stablecoins</a> and central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDCs</a>), Maday said.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It&rsquo;s too early to see &ldquo;who&rsquo;ll come out on top&rdquo; between the two, but the company will stay close to USDC and its partners &ndash; USDC issuer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/circle/"><strong>Circle</strong></a> and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/stellar/"><strong>Stellar</strong></a> network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As of June last year, MoneyGram launched a partnership with Stellar, enabling anyone with a Stellar wallet to go crypto-cash-crypto.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;It services a huge part of the global population that&rsquo;s unbanked or underbanked,&rdquo; Maday said.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Any on-off ramp that requires a bank account doesn&rsquo;t address the population that operates in cash.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;Our project allows everyday people to tap into the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">For <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/usa/">US</a> customers, in November last year, MoneyGram <a href="https://ir.moneygram.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moneygram-introduces-new-crypto-service-enabling-customers-buy">launched</a> a new service enabling these users to buy, sell, and hold <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/litecoin/">Litecoin (LTC)</a> via its mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;Consumer reaction has been pretty positive,&rdquo; said Maday, without sharing specific numbers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">MoneyGram has witnessed a &#8220;great adoption&#8221; of USDC in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/latin-america/">Latin America</a>, where it serves as a hedge against inflation.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Despite geographical differences, Maday contends that the technology itself knows no boundaries.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The tech has no limitations. The tech doesn&rsquo;t know borders.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">Although, when it comes to adoption, MoneyGram&#8217;s experience has revealed a correlation between countries with high inflation rates and their interest in alternative assets like USDC.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This insight has been one of the most significant lessons learned by the company in its ongoing exploration of the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">____</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">Learn more:&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-moneygram-partners-with-stellar-development-foundation-first-two-etfs-launched-in-hong-kong-ftx-wants-to-sell-four-subsidiaries.htm">MoneyGram Partners with Stellar Development Foundation</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-global-payments-network-moneygram-offer-cryptocurrency-services.htm">Leading Global Payments Network MoneyGram to Offer Cryptocurrency Services</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/moneygram-to-support-transfers-via-stablecoins-ceo-says-crypto-is-obviously-here-to-stay.htm">MoneyGram to Support Transfers via Stablecoins, CEO Says Crypto is &#8216;Obviously Here to Stay&#8217;</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/moneygram-slapped-with-lawsuit-over-ripple-xrp-partnership-9402.htm">MoneyGram Slapped With Lawsuit Over Ripple, XRP Partnership</a><br><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology.htm">What is Blockchain Technology?</a><br>&#8211; <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/different-categories-of-cryptocurrencies.htm">Different Categories of Cryptocurrencies</a></p>

The topic of discussion was <strong>social trading</strong> and how it can revolutionize the crypto industry.</p><p>During his interview, Jay explained how Bitget differentiates itself from other crypto exchanges in the market and how they approach listing new cryptocurrencies on the platform.</p><h2>Reliable and Transparent Information for Copy Traders</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Lee noted that the most significant difference in Bitget is its <strong>social trading feature</strong>. He mentioned that while other exchanges also have social trading, Bitget &#8220;makes sure that every trader&#8217;s information is real and assesses all traders in a transparent way&#8221; to ensure reliable information is delivered to copy traders.&nbsp;</p><p>He further explained that Bitget monitors the trading history of expert traders who sign up for the service to assess their performance. That way, a trader cannot fake their performance to dupe other users into following them.</p><p>Lee stated that becoming a social trader on Bitget comes with incentives such as getting <strong>2.5%</strong> of their followers&#8217; profits. Bitget pays this incentive in advance, as they want their users to keep their assets, and do not want to take money out of their profits.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Bitget charges no depositing fees for European and UK customers.</p><p>When asked about how Bitget evaluates new cryptocurrencies to list on the platform, Lee noted that they attend all blockchain events to find new listing projects, and have a professional listing team to add and evaluate projects. He added that they are more curious about a project&#8217;s &#8220;community, size, and liquidity.&#8221;</p><p>There are a comprehensive set of criteria checks in place to ensure that only the most promising projects are listed on the platform.</p><h2>Pioneering Education and Community in the Crypto Industry.</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>On the topic of how best to educate newcomers to the space, Lee explained that Bitget has the <strong>Bitget Academy </strong>to produce videos and articles that provide tips, market insights, and one-click copy trading to help customers. He further mentioned that Bitget&#8217;s social trading feature would attract more novice traders to the crypto industry by providing trusted traders to follow.</p><p>Lee sees social trading evolving to have a large market size in the future. He predicted that it will reach <strong>$3.8 billion</strong> <strong>USD</strong> in 2028, up from $2.2 billion today. Lee also noted that Bitget is already ranked first by social trading volume and has the largest world community, with over 380,000 social traders.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, Bitget will continue to pioneer the social trading industry.</p>

As the founder of GrantTree, a company that helps tech startups get government funding, Tenner had been deeply involved in the startup ecosystem for over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>After leaving GrantTree in 2019, he rediscovered himself through crypto and NFTs, and realized that NFTs presented a powerful fundraising model for startups.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the fact that most NFT-based startups were not successful, Tenner saw the potential in the fundraising model itself and noticed that no one else was tapping into this potential.</p><p>As such, Tenner decided to build his own NFT-based fundraising platform.</p><h2>Benefits For Both Startups and Investors</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Tenner explained that NFTs differ from traditional fundraising methods like equity crowdfunding or venture capital in several ways.&nbsp;</p><p>For investors, NFTs provide more liquidity, which is a huge advantage compared to traditional startup shares that can be very illiquid.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, NFTs can offer investors more engagement and fun, with benefits attached that can be more exciting than just getting a report once a year or quarter.</p><p>&#8220;From the startup perspective, NFTs can offer the benefit of having investors who are also customers, which can help turn early investors into super fans and evangelists who can help with marketing&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Another advantage is that NFT-based fundraising can be &#8220;global from day one&#8221;, instead of being limited to local fundraising efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Tenner, the NFT space is also less discriminatory than equity fundraising, with female founders being statistically more likely to be successful yet less likely to receive investment from VCs and angels.</p><h2>The Importance of Investor Education in Making Smart Investment Decisions</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Tenner emphasized the importance of investor education in making smart investment decisions. He has been making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@swombat/videos">YouTube videos</a> and writing threads for a year and a half, with the goal of educating people to be better investors.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Tenner, there is a &#8220;huge flaw in the education system, with people having basically no financial education when they come out of school&#8221;.&nbsp;</p><p>He believes that people should be taught how to balance a budget and how to invest, as these are &#8220;critical skills to building wealth&#8221;. Indeed, without proper education, people can fall prey to scammers.&nbsp;</p><p>Tenner hopes that either people like him or governments can fill this educational gap.</p><h2>Bring the Benefits of NFTs to One Billion People</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Tenner sees a bright future for NFT-based fundraising, hoping that as Pledg3r continues to succeed, more people will copy what the company is doing, providing many more options for fundraising through NFTs.&nbsp;</p><p>Although some people see NFTs as a big thing, Tenner thinks that, in reality, it is &#8220;still a very tiny space&#8221; so there&#8217;s plenty of room to grow.</p><p>However, he believes that in the future, &#8220;people won&#8217;t even realize they&#8217;re using NFTs&#8221;, as everything will have become an NFT in one way or another and the user interface will be completely seamless.</p><p>For Tenner, the ultimate goal is not to onboard one billion people to NFTs but to bring the benefits of NFTs and Web3 to one billion people.</p><p>As the NFT space continues to evolve and grow, Tenner&#8217;s efforts to educate and expand the market for NFT-based fundraising could play a pivotal role in shaping its future.</p><p>Tenner&#8217;s vision for NFT-based fundraising is ambitious yet practical, and he is confident that Pledg3r&#8217;s success will pave the way for more innovative ways to fundraise through NFTs, ultimately bringing the benefits of this technology to a much wider audience.</p>

Lex noted that crypto is now considered just another <strong>risk asset class</strong>, with its performance tied to that of other risky assets &ndash;&nbsp;when risk assets do well, crypto does well.&nbsp;</p><p>Lex explained that over the last year, the big blowup in Terra Luna, which hit every asset manager and custodial service that had exposure to it, resulted in <strong>lower</strong> <strong>trust</strong> in <strong>custodial services</strong> and perhaps <strong>greater</strong> <strong>trust</strong> in <strong>decentralized solutions</strong> and <strong>increased regulatory action</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The chief cryptoeconomics officer highlighted that the market drivers now include the risk of a <strong>recession</strong>, which impacts <strong>discretionary spending</strong> and relates to how much money people have to invest in crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>Lex also mentioned other drivers, such as Ethereum&#8217;s ability to stake and unstake with the <strong>Ethereum Shanghai upgrade</strong>, <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to have NFTs</strong>, and <strong>fundamental progress in the technology</strong>, which reinforces the confidence in the underlying technology.</p><p>Finally, Lex touched on the <strong>regulatory challenges</strong> in the crypto market, which continue to be difficult and will take some time to become more clear.</p><h2>The Collapse in Prices is a Repricing, Not a Major Concern</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Lex Sokolin discussed the potential timing of the next crypto bull market in relation to the current high-interest rate environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Sokolin suggested that just because the next bull market may be years away, it doesn&#8217;t mean that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are not valuable. Rather, it is just a reflection of the current economic cycle valuing them lower. Sokolin pointed to <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Netflix</strong> as examples of companies that survived through a period of undervaluation and became <strong>more valuable later</strong>.</p><p>Despite the collapse in prices, Sokolin notes that crypto has been surprisingly resilient and has remained relatively flat after a short period of volatility. He suggests that this represents a repricing of the entire market, with both tokens and tech companies going from 50x revenue to 5x revenue valuations.&nbsp;</p><p>To snap out of this period of undervaluation, Sokolin argues that there are two things that need to happen: <strong>fundamental secular adoption</strong> and a <strong>different market regime</strong>.</p><p>Sokolin believes that fundamental secular adoption will occur over time as more people begin to use Web3 services and there is increased utility in blockchain applications.&nbsp;</p><p>As for a different market regime, Sokolin advises against trying to predict when this will occur as it can lead to frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Sokolin remains optimistic about the future of crypto and believes that surviving through this current period of undervaluation can lead to <strong>significant</strong> value in the long term.</p><h2>Will MetaMask Do an Airdrop?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>When asked about a potential MetaMask airdrop, Lex Sokolin smirked and answered that ConsenSys has been exploring &#8216;all the different ways of decentralizing and tokenizing our various products and initiatives&#8217;.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Sokolin explained that it is a delicate balance for a company like ConsenSys, which has a significant footprint, to ensure its key infrastructure persists well, as so many people rely on it.&nbsp;</p><p>From an analysis and modeling perspective, the team has looked at lots of different permutations, and &lsquo;it&rsquo;s in the spirit of the company to continue in that direction&#8217;.</p><p>Finally, Lex added that given the systemic importance of MetaMask, they have to be careful about what they can do and when.</p><p>Lex&#8217;s ambiguous response is likely to sustain and even intensify ongoing speculation about a potential airdrop, given that he did not outright deny the possibility.</p>

As a result, industry <a href="https://youtu.be/VAPjTlVZGVw"><u>analysts</u></a> are predicting that it has the potential to become the fastest-growing play-to-earn cryptocurrency of the year with 10x potential.</p><p>In any gaming endeavor, it&#8217;s essential to create products that are not only rewarding but also enjoyable to play.

The feedback tool introduces a dedicated area for users to provide feedback and comments, ranging from suggestions for product improvements to community ideas covering new features.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The launch of the feedback tool marks the first phase of a multi-phase project. After months of testing and experimenting, the Binance product team has developed a new feature enabling the community to participate in the platform&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/my/user-support/feedback/entry"><u>future product roadmap</u></a>. This dedicated space will make it easier for users to suggest ideas for product features they want to see on Binance.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The product team has clarified that the central idea behind launching this new tool is to create a more direct way to gather feedback from the community on the features they want to see. Accordingly, the Binance product team will review all suggestions, following which the team will build a public-facing roadmap of all user-suggested features in March 2023.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once the public-facing roadmap goes live, the Binance community can vote on the proposed features. Based on the results, the Binance product team will add the top suggested features to its roadmap. The Binance team will continue adding live updates related to the progress of the features that people request. The feedback section will be updated later this year to allow people to leave feedback for features launched through the program.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We love hearing feedback from the community, whether it&#8217;s direct from the customer or from reviewing comments from social channels and messages &#8211; Binance has always built feedback into the product development process,&rdquo; explains Binance Head of Product Mayur Kamat. On average, we get around 1000 pieces of feedback every month &#8211; now we have a dedicated place for the community to make suggestions and leave a lasting impact on future Binance product developments.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About Binance</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Binance is the world&rsquo;s leading blockchain ecosystem and cryptocurrency infrastructure provider with a financial product suite that includes the largest digital asset exchange by volume. Trusted by millions worldwide, the Binance platform is dedicated to increasing the freedom of money for users. It features an unmatched portfolio of crypto products and offerings, including trading and finance, education, data and research, social good, investment and incubation, decentralization and infrastructure solutions, and more.&nbsp;</p>

They aim to integrate blockchain, tokenization, and earning mechanics into their games without sacrificing player enjoyment. Sustainability is also emphasized, with a focus on maintaining a steady player base with enjoyable content.</p><p><strong>True Ownership</strong>: All in-game assets in the MMG ecosystem are verified and tradable on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for a decentralized system and increased incentives for buying these assets. Players can truly own and keep their assets forever.</p><p><strong>Communities Make Games</strong>: The MMG community plays a crucial role in the development of their games. They are committed to involving players in the decision-making process and gathering feedback to continually improve their titles, while also encouraging other developers to do so. Through events, competitions, and giveaways, they will reward loyalty and skill from their members.</p><p><strong>Play and Earn</strong>: Unlike play-to-earn (P2E) games, MMG believes in play and earn (P&amp;E). Players can earn money while playing their games, but the emphasis is on gameplay enjoyment first. The focus on earning money and speculation has caused many P2E games to decline in popularity and value.</p><iframe title="Meta Masters Guild Crypto Presale $2m SOLD &#x1f680;Can This 10x Your Investment?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWKGC4Crd2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Meta Kart Racers Brings the Thrill of Earning with Racing, Plus More Games in Development</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Meta Kart offers both free play and earn-as-you-play options.</p><p>In play-to-earn mode, players can earn Gems from in-game activity and win exclusive NFTs.</p><p>Getting started with Meta Kart Racers is easy: select a driver and kart, then race on one of many tracks.
