<h2><b>Betfury Bonuses &amp; Promos</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betfury offers a decent range of bonuses and promotions. Let’s take a look at everything they currently have going on.</p>
<h3><b>Betfury Welcome Bonus Offers</b></h3>
<p>When signing up for Betfury, or when depositing for the first time, you’ll be prompted to choose a bonus. This doesn’t really do much in and of itself, other than redirecting you to a signup page. But first, let’s take a look at the bonuses.</p>
<p>The Betfury welcome bonus packs are called Bronze, Silver, and Gold, and depend on the amount you’re depositing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140422" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035484-betfury-welcome-bonus.png" alt="Betfury casino welcome bonus" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035484-betfury-welcome-bonus.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035484-betfury-welcome-bonus-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035484-betfury-welcome-bonus-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035484-betfury-welcome-bonus-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>The smallest pack, Bronze, will net you 50% on your first and 100% on your second deposit. The minimum deposit is $40 and $60 respectively, while the maximum is $200 and $300. You’ll also get a total of 600 free spins on your next six deposits.</p>
<p>In the Silver pack, your minimum amount needs to be $200 on the first and $300 on the second deposit. You’ll be getting 100% and 200% respectively, for up to $1,000 and $1,500. There are also 800 free spins waiting for you in this pack on deposits three through ten.</p>
<p>Finally, the bonus pack for high rollers, called Gold, will give you 100% on your first deposit which is at least $500, up to $1,500, and 150% on the second at a minimum deposit of $700 and maximum payout of $2,000. The extra 1,000 free spins run at 100 free spins per deposit through deposit number 12.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/betfury/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Sign up for Betfury</a>
<p>All of these bonuses have a wagering requirement of 35x. You don’t really need to do anything extra. Simply deposit at least $40 for the lowest bonus pack, or more if that’s what you’re going for. The bonus amount will be credited to your account according to the package you’ve qualified for.</p>
<p>Finally, the Betfury welcome offer needs to be completed within seven days. If you’ve reached the wagering requirement during this period, you can transfer the Bonus balance amount to your main balance.</p>
<h3><b>Betfury Shitcodes</b></h3>
<p>The term “shitcodes” refers to unique promo codes that you can use on the gambling platform. Interestingly, Betfury is one of the few casinos that <i>does</i> have an ongoing shitcode hunt promotion.</p>
<p>However – and this is what’s so specific about shitcodes – they’re the type of codes you can’t find in reviews.</p>
<p>You can usually find these codes on their social media, like X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and Reddit. They will also occasionally send you some to the email address you signed up with. Keep an eye out for promo codes advertised on the website itself.</p>
<p>Usually, the number of bonuses in them is limited, so you want to activate the code ASAP. Using a Betfury promo code, you may get free spins, a deposit bonus, free bets, or a crypto bonus on your balance.</p>
<h3><b>Existing Customer Promos</b></h3>
<p>Like all high quality casinos, Betfury does not forget its existing customers by favoring new ones. If you’ve been with them for a while, you can still take advantage of a number of different promotions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140423" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035509-betfury-promotions.png" alt="Betfury casino ongoing promotions" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035509-betfury-promotions.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035509-betfury-promotions-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035509-betfury-promotions-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035509-betfury-promotions-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>There are two main types of existing customer promos: temporary and permanent ones. Permanent promos include Betfury battles, the hunt for promo codes, bet builders and combo boosts on sports bets.</p>
<p>Other, temporary promos mostly refer to prize pools you can share if you play a certain game. These go up to an incredible €1,500,000, depending on the game.</p>
<p>All the temporary promotions clearly denote when they run out, which is extremely useful for keeping track of them.</p>
<h3><b>Betfury Loyalty Program</b></h3>
<p>The Betfury VIP program is actually not the loyalty program in its entirety. Betfury is keeping it separate: you need to get to at least level 10 in their ranking system before you can reap the best rewards reserved for VIPs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this does not mean that lower-ranked players don’t get rewards. Quite the contrary: each level has a rank bonus and a cashback percentage.</p>
<p>As soon as you get above the first level, you will get more of a personalized casino experience, as well as daily tasks for more rewards.</p>
<p>The 5% cashback starts to increase from level 6. Starting from level 10, you’re in the VIP club, which means all bonuses will be higher, you will have access to exclusive promotions, and a personal VIP manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140424" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035533-betfury-vip.png" alt="Betfury casino VIP program" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035533-betfury-vip.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035533-betfury-vip-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035533-betfury-vip-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035533-betfury-vip-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>At the top-most level, which is level 20, you get an incredible 25% of your coins back. Additionally, regardless of level, sports wagers are calculated with a 3x coefficient. In other words, excellent news for sports fans: sports betting is thrice as beneficial!</p>
<h2><b>Betfury Bonus Promo Codes</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Who doesn’t love Betfury bonus codes? They are great opportunities for you to take advantage of the platform. However, most of their bonus codes are <i>highly</i> time-sensitive.</p>
<p>In other words, the codes they post on their social media channels, mainly Telegram, will only last a day or two, or be tied to a certain event.</p>
<p>This means you can’t really find them in Betfury casino reviews such as this one. Most of the time, they are simply no longer available.</p>
<h3><b>Betfury No Deposit Bonus Codes</b></h3>
<p>Here’s some good news: Betfury does have a no deposit bonus for all who sign up at the casino. Perhaps even better, you don’t need a bonus code to activate the bonus.</p>
<p>Every new user gets 100 free spins even before they make their first deposit. All you have to do is click on the Bonuses button at the top left of your screen. Find the bonus card and click Activate.</p>
<p>You have to activate and use the free spins within 24 hours of registration. The wagering requirement is 30x, which is relatively low.</p>
<h2><b>What Games Can You Play at Betfury Casino?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Betfury casino offers access to a wide range of Betfury casino games. You’re likely to find everything you need here. Let’s take a closer look at everything they have.</p>
<h3><b>Slots</b></h3>
<p>Can you imagine a casino without slots? Luckily, you won’t have to, if you decide to sign up at Betfury.</p>
<p>There are an incredible 7,546 games on the platform as of the time of writing. Although thousands of games are pretty common at online casinos, this is still at the top of the range. It’s no surprise, then, that Betfury is among our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-slots-sites.htm">best bitcoin slots sites this year</a>.</p>
<p>The slots are arranged so that the most popular games are at the top. This way, if you’re looking for classic titles such as Sweet Bonanza, Book of Egypt, or Gates of Olympus, you don’t have to scroll at all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140425" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035552-betfury-slots.png" alt="Betfury casino available slot games" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035552-betfury-slots.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035552-betfury-slots-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035552-betfury-slots-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035552-betfury-slots-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Of course, you can also search through Betfury games if you’re looking for something specific. Also try filtering them by features such as free spins, bonus games, or a buy feature.</p>
<p>All slot games are playable in demo, so you can figure out the way they work before using real money. Also, when you hover your cursor over any of them, you can see their RTP, their provider, or add them to a list of favorites.</p>
<h3><b>Roulette</b></h3>
<p>Here’s another must have game type for any casino: roulette. You’ll find all the roulette games under the Table Games tab on the left side of the screen. You can also select only the roulette category lower in the left sidebar.</p>
<p>There are 167 different roulette titles among Betfury casino games that you can play. Choose among different types of roulette games, different providers, or simply by language.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not all of them offer demo versions of the game. Veterans will know that this is not surprising, but it may come as a surprise to newbies.</p>
<p>A few of the games are geolocked, so they will be blurred out and at the bottom of the list. But if you’re not too bothered by the exact game you’re playing, there will be plenty more to choose from.</p>
<h3><b>Blackjack</b></h3>
<p>If you’re looking for one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-blackjack-sites.htm">best crypto blackjack casinos</a>, Betfury is your friend. With more than 400 titles, it’s almost impossible to be looking for something you can’t find.</p>
<p>Our Betfury casino review found all sorts of blackjack games, including European, Vegas Strip, and Switch. There are also plenty of VIP game options for high rollers. There are also a few Free Bet games.</p>
<p>As with other games, you can usually find a language-specific game as well. Games that participate in the Drops &amp; Wins tournament have a sticker saying so in the top right corner of their icon.</p>
<h3><b>Poker</b></h3>
<p>Poker is a game that does not have its own separate category on Betfury. Still, there are plenty of poker games to choose from. You will either have to search for them or browse through the Table Games category.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/betfury/en" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Sign up for Betfury</a>
<p>Choose between Caribbean Stud, Texas Hold’Em, or any other popular type of poker. Betfury games include video poker as well as live poker.</p>
<h3><b>Live Dealer</b></h3>
<p>Live dealer games at Betfury include the games we’ve already mentioned, as well as baccarat, craps, Monopoly, and plenty of game shows.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140426" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035576-betfury-live.png" alt="Betfury casino live dealer games" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035576-betfury-live.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035576-betfury-live-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035576-betfury-live-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035576-betfury-live-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>There are almost 600 live dealer titles, so you can browse to your heart’s content. Also, if you find a game you like but the tables are full, you can probably find another version of it with more space.</p>
<h3><b>Other Games</b></h3>
<p>Among other games, Betfury also offers access to their Originals, which means they’re not games by third party software providers. Here, you’ll find Dice, Limbo, CoinFlip, Plinko, and quite a few others.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Betfury is also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-plinko-gambling-sites.htm">one of the best places to play Plinko</a> this year. You can choose among plenty of other games as well. Some of the Betfury Originals have RTPs up to an incredible 99.02%! These are definitely worth checking out.</p>
<h2><b>Betfury Sports Betting</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betfury has a pretty good sportsbook. Additionally, you can often find a Betfury bonus code specifically for a certain event, like a sports match, in their Telegram channel.</p>
<h3><b>Available Sports &amp; Markets</b></h3>
<p>Betfury has 46 different sports available on their platform. Here, you’ll find classics like soccer, tennis, basketball, but also esports like FIFA, Valorant, Dota 2, and others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140427" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035596-betfury-sports.png" alt="Betfury sportsbook" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035596-betfury-sports.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035596-betfury-sports-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035596-betfury-sports-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035596-betfury-sports-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>The number of available markets will depend on the popularity of the sport. For example, high profile soccer matches, like those from the English Premier League, will have hundreds of markets.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to place a bet on virtually anything: the number of goals, goalscorers, whether a team will score in both halves, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>The situation in esports is quite similar. Our Betfury casino review found that FIFA games also have an incredible number of markets. On the other hand, games like Dota 2 will have only a few markets, as the number of possible choices is simply lower.</p></blockquote>
<p>The total number of markets also goes down as the game progresses, as do the odds. You can still place bets throughout the games, but they won’t be as potentially lucrative as pre-match bets.</p>
<h3><b>Betfury Odds </b></h3>
<p>Betfury has decently competitive odds for a crypto casino. For example, the odds in soccer are quite similar to those offered by traditional bookmakers in the space. The same goes for all of the popular sports.</p>
<p>When it comes to esports, Betfury has a significant advantage: many more traditional bookies don’t offer any esports at all. This makes the odds at Betfury higher by default. Handy, right?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140428" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035619-betfury-dota.png" alt="Betfury sportsbook Dota 2 markets" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035619-betfury-dota.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035619-betfury-dota-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035619-betfury-dota-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035619-betfury-dota-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Generally speaking, crypto gambling enthusiasts who are also sports fans will find Betfury a very good gambling site. It’s actually one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">best bitcoin sports betting sites</a> currently available.</p>
<h2><b>What Software does Betfury Use?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Even if you’re completely new to online gambling, you’ve probably seen the words “software provider” somewhere. These are basically the creators of the games you’re playing.</p>
<p>Our Betfury casino review saw the casino using very well known and trusted software providers. There are a total of 67 different providers on the platform, including the platform itself, as it has its original games.</p>
<p>Under the Providers tab, you can see all of these names, and the number of games each provider has on Betfury. Generally speaking, however, all of these providers are verified and safe. Many of them rely on provably fair technologies, which means you can check for yourself that their games are fair.</p>
<h2><b>Betfury Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betfury deposit options are extremely varied. There are a total of 57 different cryptocurrencies that are accepted. These include the top cryptocurrencies, as well as smaller altcoins.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140429" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035652-betfury-deposit.png" alt="Betfury casino deposit window" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035652-betfury-deposit.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035652-betfury-deposit-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035652-betfury-deposit-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035652-betfury-deposit-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>The platform does not charge any deposit fees. However, there are some relatively minor withdrawal fees that depend on the method you choose.</p>
<p>Withdrawals are pretty quick. They are processed instantly. However, in the case of network congestion, it can take a little longer before the amount is credited to your private wallet.</p>

<h2><b>Betfury Interface &amp; User Experience</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Betfury has an intuitive, easy to understand interface. Signing up is quick and painless. All you need to do is provide a valid email address and set a secure password.</p>
<p>You will be prompted to use both upper- and lowercase letters, plus numbers in your password.</p>
<p>Once you’ve signed up, you don’t even have to confirm your email before you start playing. Depositing and withdrawing is done through the Wallet button at the top of the screen. This is also extremely straightforward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140430" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035750-betfury-sign-up.png" alt="Betfury casino signing up" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035750-betfury-sign-up.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035750-betfury-sign-up-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035750-betfury-sign-up-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035750-betfury-sign-up-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Finding help is also pretty easy. There is always a support chat button in the lower right corner of the screen. Opening it, you can either look for help in the FAQ section, or type your issue into the chat and wait for a reply.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-anonymous-casinos.htm">Betfury is a privacy-oriented gambling platform</a>. This means there is no mandatory KYC procedure. This tends to make a world of difference for players who take their security very seriously.</p>
<h2><b>Does Betfury Have a Mobile App?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At the time of writing, our Betfury casino review did not find a mobile app for the platform.</p>
<p>Still, the platform works very well on mobile devices when opened through a browser. This means you can still take your betting with you.</p>
<p>There is currently, however, no publicly available information whether the Betfury team intends to work on a mobile app.</p>
<h2><b>Betfury Security</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Like all quality gambling sites, Betfury holds a gambling license. It is issued by the Government of Curaçao, under the license number N.V. #365/JAZ. This means they have gone through the due process to ensure their operations are in compliance with the law in Curaçao.</p>
<p>In addition to this, using verified and trusted software providers is another point in Betfury’s favor. The same goes for their password requirements, as this is a good way to ensure that your data is well-protected.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140431" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035773-betfury-providers.png" alt="Betfury casino software providers" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035773-betfury-providers.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035773-betfury-providers-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035773-betfury-providers-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702035773-betfury-providers-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>All in all, Betfury is a secure, trusted site within the casino industry.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Metaspins?</strong></h2>

Metaspins is a relatively new crypto casino already making waves and becoming a household name as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoin-casino-sites.htm">one of the best altcoin casinos to play at</a>. But don’t be fooled by this: it also accepts bitcoin, meaning you don’t have to go out of your way to buy altcoins in order to play.</p>

<h2><strong>Metaspins Bonuses and Promos</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Metaspins offers a couple different promo options. These are available both for new and existing users. Here, we’ll take a closer look at everything that is currently available.</p>
<h3><strong>Metaspins Welcome Bonus Offers</strong></h3>
<p>The Metaspins welcome offer will match your initial deposit 100%. The maximum amount of the bonus depends on the payment method you choose. The difference can be quite noticeable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126521" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986792-metaspins-promos.png" alt="Metaspins casino promotional offers" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986792-metaspins-promos.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986792-metaspins-promos-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986792-metaspins-promos-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>It can go up to 1 BTC if you’re choosing to deposit bitcoins. But for any other payment method, the total will actually vary. The other bonuses go up to 10 ETH, 10,000 USDT, 10,000 USDC, 100 BCH, 200,000 TRX, 35,000 ADA, 150 LTC, and 125,000 DOGE.</p>
<p>For the sake of a short comparison, this makes the maximum bonus available in BTC around triple the amount that you get when you deposit stablecoins.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the bitcoin bonus was by far the most advantageous, when comparing fiat values. After that came bitcoin cash, TRON, then ether. The rest of the coins were pretty similar, with dogecoin bringing up the rear, as this bonus is worth the least.</p>
<p>The Metaspins welcome bonus actually makes it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casino-bonuses.htm">one of the best crypto casinos with bonuses</a>. No Metaspins bonus codes are required to claim this welcome bonus. However, you will be prompted to opt in when you create an account, so don’t forget to do that.</p>
<h3><strong>Metaspins Shitcodes</strong></h3>
<p>Shitcodes are codes that casinos share on their social media in order to reward their users, popularized by the BC.Game casino. However, at the time of writing, Metaspins did not offer any known shitcodes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the point of shitcodes is that they’re not always widely advertised, to reward more dedicated users. We recommend following Metaspins social media to keep up with their posts.</p>
<h3><strong>Existing Customer Promos</strong></h3>
<p>Metaspins does not have too many existing customer promos at this time. While the Metaspins welcome bonus is generous enough, existing customers will have to make do with only a couple promotions.</p>
<p>One of them is Game of the Week, where playing a certain game nets you double the points needed to level up through their loyalty program. They also list the games that will be eligible for double the points each week in the next month or so.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the daily MetaLotto. You can buy as many tickets as you want, with a discount for bulk purchases. The jackpot is worth $20,000. You also get a free ticket with every deposit you make at Metaspins.</p>
<h3><strong>Metaspins Loyalty Program</strong></h3>
<p>The casino does have a loyalty program that anyone can participate in. It requires you to place bets with real money and level up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-126523 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986906-metaspins-level-up.png" alt="Metaspins loyalty program rewards" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986906-metaspins-level-up.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986906-metaspins-level-up-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986906-metaspins-level-up-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Each time you earn points and level up, you get new rewards depending on your new level. Also, if you’re part of the Metaspins VIP program, you will also get a daily Metaspin as long as you play at least $30 at the casino within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Higher levels also get rakeback (up to 50% at the highest level) and reloads (at the highest level, 50% up to $1,000). The reload bonus adds the appropriate amount to your next deposit as a new bonus. It’s always 50%, but the maximum amount you can receive increases as you level up.</p>
<h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Metaspins Casino?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Metaspins casino offers access to all the popular casino games. Let’s break it down into sections and take a closer look at everything they have.</p>
<h3><strong>Slots</strong></h3>
<p>Metaspins offers access to thousands of slot titles on its site. They’re even categorized, making it easier to choose when you’re unsure. You’ll find categories like Drops &amp; Wins, High/Low Volatility, Classic Slots, Books games, etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-126526 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987032-metaspins-slots.png" alt="Metaspins slots selection" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987032-metaspins-slots.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987032-metaspins-slots-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987032-metaspins-slots-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /><br />
Some of the games are even categorized by their providers. This makes it easier to find titles that are extremely different from each other, but are offered by the same provider. Metaspins games are quite varied, so it’s no surprise they can also be found using the search bar. With the number of games offered, it’s no surprise Metaspins is one of the top casinos at this time.</p>
<h3><strong>Roulette</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s another must have for all online casinos. Although there is no separate category just for roulette, you can find it under Table Games, which is straightforward enough. There you’ll see Metaspins offers access to a total of 13 roulette games. Choose between live roulette and video roulette. Within these categories, you can also find the different variants, including European and French roulette.</p>
<h3><strong>Blackjack</strong></h3>
<p>Blackjack is another game found under the Table Games category (for obvious reasons). You’ll find a total of eight games available.</p>
<div class="raw-html-embed">
<div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration: none;color: white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/metaspins/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">Visit Metaspins</a></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the casino does not offer a Metaspins bonus code for any games at the time of writing, including blackjack. Additionally, table games do not count towards the wagering requirement for the welcome bonus. There are some variations among the available games, but it’s nothing too big. You’ll find European, Multihand, and Classic blackjack. There’s also a VIP option for high rollers.</p>
<h3><strong>Poker</strong></h3>
<p>Poker is one of the games that’s actually not featured within Table Games. With a total of seven games, this doesn’t seem to be very popular on Metaspins. Still, you’re able to choose between video poker and the live version. Compared to other Metaspins casino games, the number of available games is low, but the selection still covers everything people may want to play.</p>
<h3><strong>Live Dealer</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve already mentioned some of the live dealer games available on Metaspins. However, it’s important to note that there are many others, all under the Live Casino tab.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126529" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987072-metaspins-table-games.png" alt="Metaspins available table games" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987072-metaspins-table-games.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987072-metaspins-table-games-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987072-metaspins-table-games-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>You can choose among live Drops &amp; Wins, Native games (which means the games are in languages other than English), Game Shows, but also aforementioned games like blackjack and roulette, plus baccarat.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Games</strong></h3>
<p>Among the games we haven’t mentioned, very few remain. Metaspins is also home to a great selection of crash games, including Aviator. In fact, it’s one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crash-gambling-sites.htm">top crash gambling sites currently available</a>. Other Metaspins games include Plinko, Dice and Mines, among a number of others. There are plenty of opportunities for players to dig in and find something new to enjoy!</p>
<h2><strong>Metaspins Sports Betting</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Unfortunately, Metaspins does not offer sports betting. It is unclear from their website whether they intend to add this option at some point. Although there is no indication that they will, there is also no unequivocal statement that they <em>won’t</em>. This means that sports fans still have some hope their wishes will come true.</p>
<h2><strong>What Software Does Metaspins Use?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Our Metaspins review found that the casino uses well-established and well-known software providers. They have a total of 52 providers available. You can see them all under the Providers tab in the casino. To veteran players, most of the names on the Metaspins providers list will sound familiar. You’ll find Pragmatic Play, Evolution Gaming, Hacksaw Gaming, Spribe, and plenty of others here.</p>
<p>Clicking on any of the names will bring up all the games offered by that provider. This is a great way to approach your game exploration differently.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126525" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986999-metaspins-providers.png" alt="Metaspins list of software providers" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986999-metaspins-providers.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986999-metaspins-providers-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698986999-metaspins-providers-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>What’s important, however, is that all these providers are known to be trustworthy.</p>
<p>Finally, regardless of provider, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/provably-fair-bitcoin-casinos.htm">Metaspins does offer a separate tab for Provably Fair games</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Metaspins Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Metaspins deposits and withdrawals are quite straightforward and easy to understand. Metaspins deposit options include nine very popular cryptocurrencies. Depositing is easy: you click the Cashier icon in the top right of the screen, choose your currency, and follow the steps. You can choose between copying the provided address or scanning the QR code, whichever you prefer.</p>
<p>Withdrawing is just as simple. Enter the address of your private wallet and the amount you want to withdraw. There is a tiny tab that’s supposed to show the withdrawal fee, but that’s always zero. Metaspins does not currently charge any deposit or withdrawal fees.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any crypto, you can buy it through the casino. It offers purchases using Visa, MasterCard, Google Pay, and Apple Pay through Changelly and Onramper.</p>

<p>However, not only do these methods charge fees, but they also require you to go through a KYC process that is otherwise not mandatory. In fact, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-anonymous-casinos.htm">Metaspins is well-known as an excellent anonymous casino otherwise</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Metaspins Interface &amp; User Experience</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Our Metaspins review is also taking the entirety of user experience into account. Here, we break down everything we’ve found. The Metaspins casino is quite simple to navigate. On the left hand side of the screen, you’ll find the basic navigation tabs. There are five of them if you’re not logged in; seven if you’re an active user. From there, you can access the casino, MetaLotto, your own rewards, all promotions, the loyalty program, your own account, and support. As you can see, everything you need is neatly organized and accessible from one place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126534" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987142-metaspins-metalotto.png" alt="Metaspins MetaLotto promotion" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987142-metaspins-metalotto.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987142-metaspins-metalotto-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987142-metaspins-metalotto-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>When you enter the casino, the games at the top will be the games you’ve played most recently (if there are any). Under that are the categories that we’ve mentioned when we reviewed the available selection of games.</p>
<p>Signing up is also simple enough. We’ve mentioned that Metaspins is a no-KYC casino, which means you only need to provide a valid email address. However, you’ll be prompted to create a secure password, with both uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. A healthy approach to security is always good to see.</p>
<p>Another feature that Metaspins reviews in general agree is great to see is the number of available languages. Aside from English, you can also use the casino in German, French, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Finnish.</p>
<p>One potential drawback we’ve noticed is that the website does not have a scroll bar on its right side, which means you can only scroll using your mouse wheel. This makes scrolling on laptop mousepads somewhat tricky. However, this is admittedly a very minor criticism.</p>
<p>Help is also readily available. There is a Support section on the left hand side of the screen that opens a live chat with their support staff. You can also open it by clicking the Open Chat prompt written at a 90-degree angle on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126535" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987168-metaspins-help.png" alt="Metaspins help window" width="376" height="629" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987168-metaspins-help.png 376w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987168-metaspins-help-179x300.png 179w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></p>
<p>It will prompt you to either search their FAQ (another great way to troubleshoot the most common issues) or to enter your information and start chatting. The response times are pretty good, so you won’t be waiting long.</p>
<h2><strong>Does Metaspins Have a Mobile App?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At this time, Metaspins does not have a typical mobile app that would be downloadable from an app store. Instead, its interface is actually quite well optimized for smaller screens, like phones and tablets. In other words, although you won’t have a dedicated mobile app for your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">cryptocurrency betting</a>, you can still take your Metaspins profile with you wherever you go.</p>
<h2><strong>Metaspins Security</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Metaspins is a licensed crypto casino. Its parent company is incorporated under the laws of Curacao with registration number 16010, according to their website. Having a license means that Metaspins is a safe and trusted casino. Additionally, the fact that they use trusted and secure providers also helps in maintaining that image. Also, the fact that many Metaspins casino games are provably fair shows that they have no intention of looking for a better edge against you, the player.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126536" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987197-metaspins-blackjack-vip.png" alt="Metaspins blackjack VIP table" width="854" height="480" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987197-metaspins-blackjack-vip.png 854w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987197-metaspins-blackjack-vip-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1698987197-metaspins-blackjack-vip-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>Finally, their commitment to safety and security is evidenced even in the smallest details, like requiring you to set up a secure password when you’re signing up.</p>
<h2><strong>Metaspins Pros and Cons</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Summing up everything we’ve written about this casino up until now, we can make a simple list of pros and cons. Without further ado, let’s take a look at them.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Great welcome bonus</li>
<li>Straightforward leveling system in their loyalty program</li>

<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Metaspins is a great new addition to the crypto casino industry. With a great selection of games and a generous welcome bonus, it’s no wonder it’s considered one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">top crypto gambling sites</a> overall. Our Metaspins review found it very easy to navigate, secure, and customer-oriented. Admittedly, it does not have a sportsbook, so it may not be a good choice for sports fans.</p>
<p>If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, be sure to check out Metaspins. Signing up is easy and fast, and you don’t need to provide anything other than a valid email address. It will take you 30 seconds to create an account and then you’re ready to play!</p>

<p>Have you wondered if CryptoBetSports is an online gambling site worth your time? This review will go into the details of everything that it offers. </p>
<p>Here, we look at available bonuses, games, features and much more. Read on to learn whether CryptoBetSports is the gambling site for you.</p>
<h2><strong>What is CryptoBetSports?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/cryptobetsports">CryptoBetSports</a> is a crypto online gambling site offering both a casino and a sportsbook. Sports fans will be glad to know that their focus is on the latter. This means that the CryptoBetSports sportsbook is pretty rich, with competitive odds and a great interface.</p>
<p>The platform was launched by gaming veterans who decided to start offering what they thought was missing in gambling. While they don’t explicitly state what those things are, it’s pretty clear from the website. It’s easy to access, even easier to navigate, and has an enviable sportsbook.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334599/cryptobetsports-about.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Aside from this, it also has a casino with a decent spread of games: slots, tables, plus a live casino. There are constant tournaments and a loyalty program. We’ll go into more detail about each in the rest of the review.</p>
<h2><strong>CryptoBetSports Pros &amp; Cons</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>CryptoBetSports reviews agree that the gambling site looks very inviting and offers an immersive experience. To find out more about the pros and cons we’ve found while preparing this review, read on.</p>

<h2><strong>CryptoBetSports Welcome Offers</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>CryptoBetSports offers two main welcome offers: for their casino and for their sportsbook. As they differ greatly, we will be explaining both of them next.</p>
<h3><strong>CryptoBetSports Casino Welcome Bonus</strong></h3>
<p>The CryptoBetSports welcome bonus for their casino is a pretty generous one. It comes in three installments for your first three deposits.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334600/cryptobetsports-promotions.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>The first bonus is equal to 100% of your first deposit up to 1 BTC total. It also adds 50 free spins for Book Of Dead. They have a value of €0.10 each. They also expire 7 days after being credited, so don’t forget to use them!</p>
<p>The second matches your deposit 125% up to 1 BTC and adds 60 free spins for Sugar Rush. </p>
<p>The third is 150% of your third deposit, up to 5 ETH this time, with 75 free spins on Pho Sho. </p>
<p>The spins that come with the second and third deposits are worth €0.20 each and also last a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypto veterans will immediately notice that the third maximum bonus amount is significantly lower than the first two. However, with the first two being so generous, this may not be such a huge loss. After all, many casinos only offer a matched deposit up to 1 BTC <i>once</i>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each deposit bonus, regardless of amount, has a 40x wagering requirement before it can be withdrawn. All the welcome bonuses are active for seven days after activation. In other words, you have a week to meet the wagering requirements (if that’s something you’re going for).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you have to opt in to receive the welcome bonuses when you’re signing up. You will be asked whether you want to claim them or sign up without a bonus. Be sure to select the former option so you don’t miss out.</p>
<h3><strong>CryptoBetSports Sports Welcome Bonus</strong></h3>
<p>Separate from the casino, there is also a CryptoBetSports welcome bonus available for the sportsbook. It’s a bit lower than the casino: it’s worth 100% of your first deposit up to €300. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334601/cryptobetsports-sportsbook2.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>This is all they offer as a welcome within their sportsbook for the time being. However, these are not the only bonuses you can find. Let’s take a look at some of the other ones.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Bonuses &amp; Promos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although welcome bonuses are great for attracting new users, the best casinos figure out ways to keep the old ones there as well. One of the most widely appreciated ways is offering new, different bonuses and promotions.</p>
<p>One of these promotions is a weekly spin bonus. If you deposit at least €30 in a week (and $20 per week after the first time), you will get 50 free spins on a certain game. The games are chosen by the casino, which means the spins go towards players trying out new games every week.</p>
<p>On a weekly basis, there are also sports promos. These will depend heavily on the current sports events. You can find them within the sportsbook (as opposed to the Promotions tab), so keep an eye out for changes!</p>
<p>Finally, CryptoBetSports has a daily spin opportunity for all players. The prizes go from free spins for certain games up to 1 ETH. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334602/cryptobetsports-free-spin.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, at this time, there is no CryptoBetSports casino no deposit bonus available. This means you can claim their bonuses only if you deposit funds. </p>
<h2><strong>What Sports Can You Bet on at CryptoBetSports?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Like its name implies, CryptoBetSports offers a great selection of sports. There are currently 31 sports available, plus a Specials tab for other types of bets. </p>
<p>The offered sports range from immensely popular ones, like soccer or tennis, to stock car racing and Gaelic hurling. This means pretty much everyone is guaranteed to find something they’re interested in.</p>
<p>When you open the CryptoBetSports sportsbook, you can find the range of sports on the left-hand side of the screen. First, there are the most popular available markets: current soccer games, for example, plus all of today’s events.</p>
<p>Under that, you will find a complete list of sports, with the number of currently available markets listed next to them. </p>
<p>If you’re late to placing a prematch bet, CryptoBetSports also offers live betting. The odds will change depending on the way the game goes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334603/cryptobetsports-sportsbook3.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>CryptoBetSports also offers a Cash Out feature which lets you claim some of your potential profits before the event ends and the tide potentially turns against you. However, keep in mind that using this feature may void any bonuses you used within that bet.</p>
<p>Get your non-sports bets ready to go in the Specials section. You can bet on Emmy and Oscar awards here, with odds as great as on any other gambling platform.</p>
<p>There is also a completely separate tab for esports betting. Here, you’ll find the basics: DotA, Counter Strike, and League of Legends. Still, these are also approached with the professionalism inherent to their sportsbook, so you won’t be disappointed.</p>
<h3><strong>CryptoBetSports Odds</strong></h3>
<p>A good range of available markets is a great thing, but a lot still depends on the odds – no pun intended. </p>
<p>Generally, CryptoBetSports boasts pretty competitive odds. They’re similar to – if admittedly slightly lower than – the odds offered by the top fiat-based bookies in the world.</p>
<p>Combine your betting with any CryptoBetSports bonus codes you may have, and you’re in for a treat. The most popular games, like the English Premier League soccer games, will have hundreds of markets available. </p>
<p>When it comes to the way odds are denoted, the decimal system is set as default. You can also choose between the fractional, American, Hong Kong, and Malaysian systems.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334604/cryptobetsports-sportsbook.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>It’s also possible to set up your betslip to practically automate the bets you place. Set a certain bet amount, which events you want to bet on, and whether you want the platform to automatically accept changes to the markets, and you’re good to go.</p>
<h2><strong>CryptoBetSports Casino Games</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although their focus is visibly on the sportsbook, CryptoBetSports also offers a decent spread of casino games for their users. Our CryptoBetSports review takes a look at (some of) everything you can find here.</p>
<h3><strong>Slots</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-slots-sites.htm">Like every good casino</a>, CryptoBetSports offers a great range of slot games. Here, you’ll find all the immensely popular games from top providers: Sweet Bonanza, Gates of Olympus, The Dog House, and Aviator are all immediately available. </p>
<p>The majority of games can also be tried through their demo mode. Simply choose Demo instead of Play and you can see how the games work before you commit your funds to them. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334605/cryptobetsports-slots.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>It is also quite useful that each game has the name and logo of their provider in the upper right corner. This way, you can choose among the often visually quite similar games and find the one you prefer. </p>
<h3><strong>Poker</strong></h3>
<p>CryptoBetSports has a great selection of different poker games. They range from your usual video poker to different variants like Deuces Wild or Jacks or Better.</p>
<p>All video poker games can be demoed. Unfortunately – but not uncommonly – you can’t demo live games. This is the same across all platforms, so it’s not a quirk of this gambling site.</p>
<p>Even before you start playing poker (or any card game available on the platform), CryptoBetSports offers a rulebook that you can read. It encompasses a number of different games from different providers. Our CryptoBetSports review found this quite useful to learn their often subtle differences. </p>
<h3><strong>Blackjack</strong></h3>
<p>Blackjack is another immensely popular card game that can be played both as a video game and in its live version. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, CryptoBetSports was offering more than 120 different Blackjack titles. Many of them are variations of pretty much the same rules from different providers.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334614/cryptobetsports-blackjack.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>As with all game options, you can filter the games you see by provider, or search them up by name. </p>
<p>Once again, the rulebook available on the website can help you figure out the slight differences between the versions.</p>
<h3><strong>Roulette</strong></h3>
<p>With almost 160 titles to choose from, CryptoBetSports offers all the roulette versions you could want.</p>
<p>The live versions often have several games available, so you don’t have to wait for a spot to open up at the table.</p>
<p>Choose between Russian, French, or European roulette. If you’re feeling up to the challenge, check out the high stakes version of the game. </p>
<p>Overall, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that CryptoBetSports is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-roulette-sites.htm">one of the best roulette casinos currently available</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Live Tables</strong> </h3>
<p>This CryptoBetSports review found that the main featured live games were roulette and blackjack. However, browsing the plain Casino tab, we found that they offer some other live games as well, including poker.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334606/cryptobetsports-live.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>However, it’s easy to see why only these two take the live tables spotlight. There are 51 live roulette games, and 50 live blackjack options. </p>
<p>In other words, anything you might want – you can find it here, no problem. It should come as no surprise that CryptoBetSports is overall a very loved and appreciated casino.</p>
<h2><strong>CryptoBetSports Features</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>We’ve mentioned the gambling platform’s focus on sports several times already. This is why it’s practically expected of them to offer better sports features than other similar platforms.</p>
<p>And they do not disappoint. Here, you will find weekly bonuses that depend on the sports events that are happening. </p>
<p>The choice of bonuses depends on the season as well. When it’s time for soccer championships, you can expect more soccer-focused promos. As if you’d need more incentive to play the hottest markets of the day!</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334607/cryptobetsports-rulebook.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>The CryptoBetSports sportsbook is super user-friendly, so you can see most of their advantages at a glance. Choose between a single bet and a multiple bet slip; this lets you either keep your bets separate or combine them for better odds. </p>
<p>There is also a System option; the difference between Multiple and System is that Multiple requires at least two, and System at least three bets to be valid. </p>
<h2><strong>Software Providers</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>CryptoBetSports offers access to games from a decent 73 software providers. All the industry giants are there: Pragmatic Play, Spribe, Evolution, and Nolimit City, among many others.</p>
<p>The opportunity to check out providers you may not know presents itself immediately. You can filter any and all games through the Provider tab.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334608/cryptobetsports-providers.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>All of these software providers are tried and tested. They offer great games, transparent RTPs, and are often provably fair. All of them help CryptoBetSports be <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-decentralized-gambling-sites.htm">one of the best decentralized casinos in the industry</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>CryptoBetSports Deposits and Withdrawals</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Nobody wants to be kept waiting when they want to gamble. CryptoBetSports reviews in general agree: deposits and withdrawals at this site are quick and painless.</p>
<p>However, deposits are not necessarily instant. The casino states that they process withdrawals “regularly”; this can mean in regular intervals. Some casinos do this to preserve the privacy of their users, for their own security reasons, but also to keep network costs down.</p>
<p>CryptoBetSports does not charge any deposit or withdrawal fees. Users opting for crypto payments will have to pay the usual network fees – but that’s outside of the casino’s scope of influence.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334609/cryptobetsports-register.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>However, keep in mind that CryptoBetSports is <strong>not</strong> an anonymous casino. You won’t be able to request a withdrawal until after you’ve completed the KYC process. This will require you to provide certain documents that the casino will notify you about.</p>
<h2><strong>Accepted Payment Methods</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although, as its name suggests, CryptoBetSports is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoin-casino-sites.htm">primarily a crypto casino</a>, it does offer more payment options. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, all the most popular cryptos are covered. You can use <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), TRON (TRX), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a>, XRP (XRP), and bitcoin cash (BCH) to deposit and withdraw funds. It also supports Interact for Canada and Pix for Brazil.</p>
<p>If you do not have crypto but would prefer to use it instead of fiat, you can buy it through the casino. It offers purchases through MoonPay and Mercury, two well-known and trusted crypto payment solutions. Both of them accept Visa and MasterCard, but also Apple Pay.</p>
<p>If you are, however, completely unwilling to try out crypto payment solutions, you can also use fiat. Once again, Visa and MasterCard are accepted, along with Pix and Interact.</p>
<h2><strong>Banking Fees</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As with most casinos, the total fees will depend on the payment method you choose. This is why crypto may be a better option than fiat, as fiat payment options tend to cost a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>Crypto options charge a gas fee that goes to those maintaining the network. These fees can be tweaked when you’re sending from your private wallet. In other words, there is no set amount you have to pay. However, if you pay less than the average, your transaction may take longer to process.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fiat payment options tend to incur anywhere between 2% and 5% of your transaction total. The exact amount will vary depending on the method you choose. The best way to check is to request a withdrawal from your account and see what you’re presented with.</p>
<h2><strong>Withdrawal Times</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Once again, withdrawal times also vary depending on the payment method chosen. Crypto payments can take anywhere from a few seconds to 10 minutes. </p>
<p>However, the requested withdrawal has to be processed by the gambling site first. Although this is usually done very quickly, they reserve the right to take up to seven days to process your request. This is to ensure that all the KYC steps are completed before the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Usually, if you’ve completed your KYC process in time, the withdrawal shouldn’t take more than a few hours at most.</p>
<p>For fiat payment options, withdrawal times depend on the service provider or bank. </p>

<h2><strong>CryptoBetSports User Experience</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our CryptoBetSports review found this online gambling platform to be one of the best currently available crypto sportsbooks. Even on your first visit to the site, you will find it easy to navigate and figure out. </p>
<p>The site is separated into a Live Casino, a Casino, and Sportsbook. Aside from the three, there are also separate tabs for Promotions, Tournaments, and a Loyalty program. However, at the time of writing, the Loyalty program tab only said “Coming Soon”. We’re hoping to see an equally high-quality program from the gambling site as everything else they’re offering.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334611/cryptobetsports-language.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>We’ve mentioned that the Casino tab offers access to thousands of games. The number actually exceeds 9,000 as of the time of writing. To navigate this ocean of possibilities, you can search the games by name, filter them by provider, or just browse through until you find something to catch your attention.</p>
<p>The Live Casino tab features roulette and blackjack options. Again, they can be filtered by the provider, so you don’t have to scroll (seemingly endlessly!) through the available options.</p>
<p>Finally, the Sportsbook – the crowning jewel of the site – is an incredibly professional-looking feature. Offering plenty of necessary information without cluttering your desktop, it treads the border between accessibility and professionalism carefully. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Browsing through the possibilities offered at CryptoBetSports is great fun, but if you know what you’re looking for, you can actually find it quite quickly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site also offers both a light and a dark mode. You can toggle between the two in the top right of the screen.</p>
<p>In the same place, you can also find the different language options. Right now, gamblers can use CryptoBetSports in twelve different languages. The default is set to English, but the flag at the top of the screen makes it easy to find where to change your preference, if necessary.</p>
<p>Overall, CryptoBetSports reviews peg it as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-soccer-betting-sites.htm">one of the best crypto sportsbooks in the industry</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Licensing &amp; Security &#8211; is CryptoBetSports Safe?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Like any serious gambling site, CryptoBetSports does have a gambling license. It is provided by the Government of Curaçao under the number 365/JAZ, Sub-License GLH-OCCHKTW0703022023. You can check the number for yourself <a href="https://www.curacao-egaming.com/">on the Curaçao eGaming website</a>.</p>
<p>This means that the platform is bound by rules and regulations set out by the Curaçao gambling authority. In other words, their games have to be fair and transparent, and your funds kept safe.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334612/cryptobetsports-aviator.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Additionally, with the required KYC checks, CryptoBetSports shows that they take their customers’ safety seriously. KYC is not the most favorite term in the crypto world, although it&#8217;s not mandatory at CryptoBetSports.</p>
<p>This is one of the features that tends to be a dealbreaker for users, so we always urge users to weigh the pros and cons for themselves. As far as our own CryptoBetSports review goes, we can attest that this is a safe and secure platform. If you&#8217;re fine with the KYC, it is definitely worth checking out for any true sports fan.</p>
<h2><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Overall, CryptoBetSports has established itself as one of the best casino and sportsbook options in the market. Although its focus is decidedly on the sportsbook part of the platform, its casino is on par with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">any of the best gambling sites we have reviewed</a>. But for sports fans, this is the promised land. From thousands of markets to competitive odds, you&#8217;re guaranteed to find what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126716/334613/cryptobetsports-sweet-bonanza.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>If you&#8217;re still unsure whether CryptoBetSports deserves your attention, let us point out that the welcome bonus is competitively generous. With its low minimum deposit and withdrawal limits, a safe and secure platform, and a great selection of games, CryptoBetSports is the next casino you should definitely check out.</p>

<h2><strong>Best VPN-Friendly Crypto Casinos Reviewed</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>If you can’t decide from the simple descriptions we’ve offered, in this section, we will go into more detail about each listed casino.</p>
<p>Here, we cover what we found to be among the most important aspects of each casino. This includes deposit and withdrawal times, bonuses and promotions, but also restricted territories that may require VPN use. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Lucky Block: Best Overall Casino with 200% Welcome Bonus up to EUR 10,000</strong></h3>
<p>This is the best VPN-friendly crypto casino on our list, and in this review, you’ll find out why. First of all, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/lucky-block-casino/">Lucky Block</a> offers a generous welcome bonus of 200% of your initial deposit, going up to EUR 10,000. </p>
<p>You will also receive 50 free spins for the Wanted Dead or a Wild game, so you can get started painlessly and see if it catches your attention.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333595/lucky-block.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>This is far from the only promotion offered at Lucky Block. You can get up to EUR 200 extra on Mondays when you deposit funds into your account. There’s a new game being promoted weekly, so you can get free spins on your deposits to test it out. Weekends are for slots tournaments, so free up your schedule for a prize pool worth EUR 5,000.</p>
<p>Lucky Block is a VPN-friendly casino because it does have a decent list of restricted territories. There are a total of 27, including the US and quite a few western European countries. But as they’re still accessible by VPN, there’s no need to let the FOMO panic set in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you <i>would </i>be missing out quite a bit if you didn’t check out Lucky Block. This casino offers a myriad of slots, all the best table games, and a great sportsbook. This makes it easily <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">one of the best crypto casinos</a> overall.</p>
<p>Most games have a demo version so you can try them out. The sportsbook odds are also very competitive, and many popular sports (and quite a few less popular ones) are offered.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333596/lucky-block-2.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Finally, there is also the loyalty program. Playing every day will unlock you a streak, which offers free spins of a reward wheel. Leveling up, which is done by collecting points through wagers, unlocks new perks that are otherwise unavailable.</p>
<p>All in all, this is the top casino among casinos that allow VPNs and you shouldn’t miss it. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Mega Dice: 200% Welcome Bonus, Telegram Integration &amp; Loyalty Program</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s another casino you won’t want to miss. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice</a> offers a 200% welcome bonus on your first deposit up to a pretty generous 1 BTC. You’ll also get 50 free spins for Wanted Dead or a Wild. All you need to do is deposit the equivalent of at least EUR 20 in the cryptocurrency of your choice.</p>
<p>Speaking of cryptocurrencies, Mega Dice accepts 12 of the most popular coins. This VPN-friendly casino lets you deposit <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), dogecoin (DOGE), Tether (both USDTT and USDTE), TRON (TRX), XRP (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (both BNB and BNB-BSC), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin (USDC). </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333597/mega-dice.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Both deposits and withdrawals charge no fees and are instantaneous. In other words, you can start playing as soon as your first deposit is credited to your account. </p>
<p>Use the bonus to try out the games you’re less than familiar with. At a casino with such a generous selection of games, chances are, quite a few titles will seem new to you.</p>
<p>Mega Dice is one of the few VPN-friendly crypto casinos that offer a Telegram integration. This means you can play through the app, as well as on its website. Simply put, this is a whole new approach to making a casino mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>You can also find plenty of slots, live games and a sportsbook. All of them offer pretty much all the titles and sports casual fans tend to be interested in, but also a few more options for veterans.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333598/mega-dice-2.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Finally, your loyalty will be rewarded through a program that gives you new rewards for every level reached. As soon as you sign up, you immediately participate in the program, so no need to opt in separately. This makes it a great choice for players from all walks of life. </p>

<h3><strong>3. BC.Game: Four Bonuses, Daily Wheel Spin and Ongoing Quests</strong></h3>
<p>The first thing that greets you when you open the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bcgame/">BC.Game</a> casino is a prize wheel you can spin. This is available daily, both for existing users and for newcomers. </p>
<p>The only difference is that you can only claim the prize with an account. Every spin is a win, so you can be getting prizes before you even sign up.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333599/bc-game.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Once you do sign up, however, the first deposit you make will net you a 180% welcome bonus. Keep depositing, though! This VPN-friendly casino also offers bonuses of 200%, 220%, and 240% on the second, third, and fourth deposits.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more opportunities for free funds, you can participate in daily and weekly quests. They’re done through playing games offered on the platform, so you’re guaranteed to have fun throughout.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333600/bc-game-2.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>In a hurry to deposit and/or withdraw? BC.Game takes only as long as the blockchain network of the cryptocurrency you’ve chosen. This means deposits and withdrawals are instantaneous on their end. </p>
<p>Realistically, they can take anywhere between a couple of minutes and an hour. The latter is common for bitcoin, but not necessarily for other cryptos. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Betpanda.io: No VPN Needed for UK-Based Players</strong></h3>
<p>Many casinos have an issue with bitcoin (BTC) being relatively slow to deposit and withdraw, especially compared to other cryptocurrencies. Where most others take a few minutes tops, BTC takes a minimum of 10 minutes, sometimes even longer.</p>
<p>This is where the Lightning Network comes in: it significantly shortens the time required for the funds to be moved. Betpanda is one of the best VPN-friendly casinos offering Lightning Network deposits and withdrawals. This means deposits and withdrawals are <i>even faster</i> than at most other casinos.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333601/betpanda.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>When it comes to bonuses, Betpanda also offers a great welcome bonus. It matches your first deposit 100% up to 1 BTC, making it quite a generous offer. The casino also doesn’t charge any fees, hidden or otherwise, when you’re depositing and withdrawing funds.</p>
<p>The casino offers a pretty standard (but rich!) spread of casino games. You’ll find plenty of slots and crash games, which makes it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-slots-sites.htm">one of our best bitcoin slots sites</a>. Notably, however, there is no sportsbook available.</p>
<p>Ongoing promotions include a 10% cashback on a weekly basis, plus a loyalty club. Leveling up gets you new perks, and all you have to do is place wagers with real money.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Wild.io: Ongoing Promotions, Daily Rewards, and Great Loyalty Program</strong></h3>
<p>Among casinos that allow VPNs, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wildio/">Wild.io</a> is a popular choice due to its huge welcome package. It offers a total of 480% on your first four deposits; this means you’re continuously rewarded for staying with them. </p>
<p>The bonuses are divided so that you get up to 120% on your first deposit, and 110%, 125% and 125% on the second, third, and fourth, respectively. Each bonus also comes with free spins: 75 for the first, third and fourth, and 50 for the second deposit.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333602/wild-io.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>This is far from the only available promotion. You will be able to spin a prize wheel daily, get 20% in weekly cashback, participate in a daily rakeback, and more. Additionally, they often organize tournaments for specific games with generous prize pools, so many people get to share the pool.</p>
<p>On a regular basis, Wild.io will add a game to their weekly spotlight. Playing the game will double the status points you earn to climb through their loyalty program. This makes it significantly easier for you to unlock new levels and rewards.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-instant-withdrawal-bitcoin-casinos.htm">With quick deposits and withdrawals</a>, no fees, and no KYC, it’s no wonder this is one of the best VPN-friendly casinos we’ve found. </p>

<h3><strong>6. Metaspins: Try Out the MetaLotto for a $20,000 Jackpot</strong></h3>
<p>Who doesn’t love an opportunity to win big? <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/metaspins/">Metaspins</a> is another VPN-friendly casino on our list offering ways users can win even outside of traditional games. </p>
<p>Most notable is their MetaLotto, a daily lottery worth $20,000 in crypto. If you’re buying several tickets, keep an eye out for super useful discounts.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333603/metaspins.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Before that, however, you’ll have to sign up. Don’t forget to claim your welcome bonus, which is worth 100% of your first deposit up to 1 BTC.</p>
<p>Luckily, signing up is quick and easy and won’t require you to leave your personal information. You only need an email address to sign up.</p>
<p>Metaspins has a loyalty program named Level Up. Like with most casinos offering a similar system, you earn points by wagering. A promoted game will, on a weekly basis, offer double the usual amount of points. Leveling up through the system unlocks several rewards, including rakeback. </p>

<h3><strong>7. Heybets.io: Huge Loyalty Program Rakebacks for VIP Members</strong></h3>
<p>Heybets has one of the most generous VIP clubs among the best VPN-friendly casinos. All you need to do to become a member is meet their wager requirements. This will give you between 5% and 50% in instant rakeback, among other things. </p>
<p>If you already reached VIP status at some other online casino, that’s transferable! You just need to provide proof of your status to Heybets and they will match your level at their casino. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333604/heybets.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Interestingly, however, Heybets does not offer a welcome bonus anymore. We hope that this is temporary and that they will add a new welcome bonus soon.</p>
<p>Heybets also has a very user-friendly interface. The casino and sportsbook are separate and the landing site is very smooth and streamlined.</p>
<p>Deposits and withdrawals are free and fast. On the other hand, the number of accepted cryptocurrencies is quite limited. </p>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333605/vave.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Vave offers 100% cashback up to 1 BTC on their casino and sportsbook separately. You also don’t have to choose if you don’t want to – just pick both!</p>
<p>This VPN-friendly crypto casino is privacy-oriented in other ways, too. You don’t need to provide anything more than a valid email address when signing up. </p>
<p>This means there’s no KYC procedure, making it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-anonymous-casinos.htm">one of the best anonymous casinos currently available</a>. </p>

<h3><strong>9. Flush.com: Constant Promotions and Tournaments with Prize Pools</strong></h3>

<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333606/flush.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Their welcome bonus ranges between 100% and 150% on your first deposit, depending on the amount. The maximum amount that gets a bonus is $1,000, which is quite low compared to other casinos.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the number of casino games available, combined with tournaments, make this a casino worth your while. Here, you will find all the most popular slots, table games, a live dealer, game shows, and more. There is no sportsbook available. </p>

<h3><strong>10. Betplay: Weekly 10% Cashback on VIP Level 1</strong></h3>
<p>VIP levels at any casino will usually offer perks that are not available to others, but you have to level up quite a bit before you get to them. Not (necessarily) at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/betplay/en">Betplay</a>: the first VIP level already offers 10% cashback on a weekly basis, and this amount increases as you level up.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333607/betplay.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Their welcome bonus, on the other hand, is relatively humble. Your first deposit of up to $1,000 will be matched 100%. The exact amount will depend on the cryptocurrency you choose to deposit, but the total does not exceed $1,000.</p>
<p>Betplay made our list of the best VPN-friendly casinos due to its Lightning Network integration. This means that even the slowest BTC deposits and withdrawals are almost instantaneous. They’re also free, as the casino does not charge any deposit and withdrawal fees. </p>

<h2><strong>Why Use a VPN for Online Casinos?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>VPNs have a very wide range of use cases that mostly depend on your habits and needs. When it comes to online casinos that allow VPN usage, some of those use cases are especially apparent. Let’s take a look at some of them.</p>
<h3><strong>Evading Geo-Locks</strong></h3>
<p>Licensed casinos cannot offer their services in countries and territories that don’t have adequate regulations surrounding them. For example, in the United States, <a href="https://www.onlinegambling.com/us-gambling-laws/">offshore gambling is strictly prohibited for all citizens on a federal level</a>. Most online casinos are licensed by the government of Curaçao, which is decidedly not in the US.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that out of 50 states, only six allow online gambling in any form. Those are Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.claims.co.uk/knowledge-base/sports-law/online-gambling#:~:text=Gambling%20within%20the%20UK%20is,a%20casino%20and%20start%20gambling.">The UK does not forbid online gambling</a>, but navigating the rules can be confusing. Many casinos have the UK on their restricted list.</p>
<p>This means that, if you’re on holiday in a restricted country, you may be blocked from accessing your casino. VPNs offer a painless way of avoiding this restriction.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333612/cards.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Privacy and Security</strong></h3>
<p>There is no such thing as being too careful. While the best VPN-friendly casinos will already have security measures in place, users should also take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>By obscuring your actual IP address, VPNs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to glean your other information.</p>
<p>Many hackers can be lurking in places like casinos, where money is earned and spent. In spite of the casinos’ best efforts, they can slip through the cracks. VPNs can offer one more layer of protection for the end user.</p>
<h3><strong>Speed and Performance</strong></h3>
<p>Even if your jurisdiction allows online gambling, it’s possible they’re trying other ways to limit it. One of these insidious ways can be ISP throttling, in which your internet speed is deliberately limited for any reason. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/vpn-speed/#:~:text=Can%20a%20VPN%20improve%20Internet,streaming%20entertainment%20services%20like%20Netflix.">VPNs can help you circumvent these limitations</a>.</p>
<p>There are also potential network congestions, simply due to too much traffic, that can be evaded through VPN usage. In other words, VPN-friendly <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-casinos/">crypto casinos</a> will let you turn these problems into non-issues simply by enabling another access point.</p>
<p>On the other hand, keep in mind that VPN usage can actually exacerbate these problems. It’s important to weigh the pros and cons before committing to any course of action.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Pick the Best VPN-Friendly Casino for You</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The criteria to pick the best VPN-friendly casinos can (and should) differ from person to person. Here, we offer an overview of the general rules most people abide by. This way, you can choose which apply to your specific situation and which are mostly optional.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Bonus</strong></h3>
<p>Almost every well-known casino offers some sort of welcome bonus as an enticement for new users. The actual amounts tend to differ, as do the wagering requirements that you have to fulfill before you can withdraw your balance.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333611/lucky-block-3.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Most casinos offer a percentage bonus based on your first deposit, up to a certain amount. Others will offer different percentages depending on the amount. Some will even give you several welcome bonuses on your first few deposits.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you should also watch the wagering requirements. If they’re too high, chances are the welcome bonus will never really leave your account. Still, it can be a pretty good sum to play with!</p>
<h3><strong>Range of Games</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re committing to using a VPN for online casinos, might as well pick a casino that meets all your requirements. This can mean having all the slots you like to play, live options of table games, or an extensive sportsbook.</p>
<p>Some people couldn&#8217;t care less for baccarat, but don’t want to consider a casino that doesn’t offer esports betting. And that’s okay! This is a simple matter of preference, but one that can slip between the cracks when you’re focusing on everything else.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don’t care for sports but like live dealers for high rollers, you will want to pick a casino that caters to more exclusive members.</p>
<h3><strong>Accepted Payment Options</strong></h3>
<p>Privacy-oriented individuals are already very likely to choose cryptocurrencies for their relative anonymity. But not every crypto option is created equal, and many prefer one coin to all the others. For example, <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/privacy-coins-anonymity-enhanced-cryptocurrencies/">some coins are more focused on privacy than others</a>. Still, this doesn’t have to be your only criteria.</p>
<p>Regardless of your preferences, this means you need to check whether your VPN-friendly online casino accepts the cryptocurrency you want to use.</p>
<h3><strong>Regulations, License &amp; Provably Fair Games</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important aspects of online gaming is user security. Many users will rightfully insist upon feeling safe and secure at the casino of their choice.</p>
<p>On the casino’s side, this is done by obtaining a gaming license. This proves their commitment to offering a product deemed safe and viable by a gambling authority. </p>
<p>Additionally, a territory’s regulations will stipulate whether users are allowed to gamble at all, at which casinos, how much, and through which payment methods. This is another step in protecting the people from potentially uncontrollable and irretrievable losses.</p>
<p>Finally, all the casinos that allow VPN use we’ve listed use provably fair technology. In other words, there are ways users can check that the games are truly fair and not rigged against them. Most of our casinos on this list are considered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/provably-fair-bitcoin-casinos.htm">among the best provably fair casinos available</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Are VPN-Friendly Casinos Safe &amp; Legal?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Here’s a completely honest answer: not all online casinos that allow VPN usage are necessarily safe and legal. Their VPN-friendliness in no way guarantees they’re otherwise good to use. </p>
<p>They can present all of the usual risks that shady casinos tend to have: rigged games, unsafe accounts that are easily hacked, inadequate protection of personal data, and so on. </p>
<p>However, this is where reviews such as this one come in handy. Here we offer casinos that have been tested and found adequate. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126334/333613/mega-dice-3.jpg" alt="" width="854" /></figure>
<p>Names such as <strong>Lucky Block</strong> and <strong>Mega Dice </strong>are already well-known in the industry for their professionalism and security. This is one of the reasons they rank so highly on our list – other reasons include everything we’ve stated in our review.</p>
<p>Simply put, not every casino out there – VPN-friendly or not – is necessarily safe to use. But through some basic research and precautionary measures, there are quite a few gems you can find.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Whether you’re traveling abroad, trying to protect your data, or just wanting to check out new casinos, casinos that allow VPN use are a pretty great choice. Our list narrows down the choices offered in the market to the best we’ve found. If you’re still unsure, Lucky Block is the way to go.</p>

<h2><strong>Empire.io Bonuses &amp; Promos </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/empire/en">Empire.io</a> had several different ongoing promotions. Interestingly, no Empire.io bonus codes are required to claim any of them. You simply fulfill the requirements of the bonus you want to claim and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>First off is their welcome bonus. This will see your first deposit of at least $50 matched 100%, up to a total of 1 BTC. </p>
<p>On Tuesdays, there is also a 20% boost of up to 1000 USDT on any video slot you like. There is also a loyalty club: the more you play, the more points you collect. Points let you level up, and each of the seven levels offers extra perks.</p>
<p>The Empire.io review will now cover each of these in a little more detail.</p>

<h3><strong>Empire.io Welcome Bonus Offers</strong></h3>
<p>As we’ve already mentioned, Empire.io’s welcome bonus is a 100% match of your first deposit. Although it is advertised as going up to 1 BTC, the reality is a little more complicated. The actual bonus will depend on your deposit currency of choice.</p>
<p>If you’re depositing at least $50 worth of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, your bonus will go up to 1 BTC. For other cryptos, the bonus is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">Tether (USDT)</a>: 10,000 USDT</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ether (ETH)</a>: 10 ETH</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>: 130,000 DOGE</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tron/">TRON (TRX)</a>: 35,000 TRX</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/litecoin/">Litecoin (LTC)</a>: 120 LTC</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP (XRP)</a>: 20,000 XRP</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum bonus amount for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano (ADA)</a> is not listed on the website.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332859/empire-io-promotions.jpg" alt="Empire casino welcome offer" /></figure>
<p>The minimum deposit needed in order to claim the bonus stays the same, which is $50. You also have to claim your bonus within 10 days of registration.</p>
<p>The bonus is subject to a 50x wagering requirement before it can be withdrawn. The maximum single bet amount is 5 EUR or its equivalent in any currency.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is no Empire.io promo code needed to claim this welcome bonus.</p>
<h3><strong>Empire.io Shitcodes</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there were no active shitcodes for Empire.io. However, this doesn’t mean there won’t be any in the coming days. Be sure to check back and keep your eyes peeled. They may not be advertised too openly on the casino’s website, but it’s worth exploring a bit to find them.</p>
<h3><strong>Existing Customer Promos</strong></h3>
<p>For most people, the welcome bonus is only attractive if the casino proves they care for their existing users too. Luckily, our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/empire/en">Empire.io review</a> found that this is true: the casino does offer promos for existing customers. </p>
<p>One of them is a 20% bonus on Tuesdays. It goes up to USDT 2,000 and is usable for 10 minutes only. This means you have a short period of time to maximize your wins – which can be quite fun. The fun is amplified by the fact that there are no wagering requirements, so everything you win is immediately yours!</p>
<p>You can bet up to 2 USDT or currency equivalent each time, and all your winnings are boosted 20%. You can use whichever currency the platform supports, and the boost starts with the first spin after its activation.</p>
<h3><strong>Empire.io Loyalty Program</strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332867/empire-io-loyalty-club.jpg" alt="Empire casino player levels" /></figure>
<p>Empire.io casino games reward you in multiple ways. Other than the usual wins you can get, you also gain points for loyalty the more you play. </p>
<p>The loyalty program offered by Empire.io has seven levels total. There is no need to manually opt in; you start collecting points and leveling as soon as you start playing. All you need to do is place real money bets – win or loss, you get points.</p>
<p>Each level offers new rewards. These include generous cashbacks and rewards generated based on your gameplay, like free spins of specific games.</p>
<p>When you’re far enough, from level four onwards, you even get a points multiplier. This means collecting points should speed up even more.</p>
<p>Best of all, all rewards are real money, with no wagering requirement!</p>
<h2><strong>Empire.io Bonus Promo Codes</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>No Empire.io bonus code is necessary to claim any of the rewards. The rewards are usually quite simple to claim. All you need to do is deposit for the welcome bonus, or start playing for the Tuesday boost. </p>
<p>Many casinos require you to do all those steps and also enter a bonus code to claim your reward. Empire.io doesn’t, and that can be considered an advantage. This means what you see is what you get!</p>
<h3><strong>Empire.io No Deposit Bonus Codes</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there was no Empire.io no deposit bonus code available. Empire.io’s bonuses depend on you depositing money into your account. However, we are hoping that the platform will decide to add no deposit bonuses as well. </p>
<h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Empire.io Casino?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332860/empire-io-all-games.jpg" alt="Empire casino games offering" /></figure>
<p>Games available at the Empire.io casino fall into a few broad categories. In total, the casino offers more than 4,500 games. You can access them under the All Games tab on the left hand side of the screen. You can also search for any game you like in the search bar on the upper right side.</p>
<div class="raw-html-embed">
<div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration: none;color: white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/empire/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">Visit Empire.io</a></div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Slots</strong></h3>
<p>Our Empire.io review found a huge selection of slots available at this casino – more than 4,400. This includes all the popular titles like Fire in the Hole, Gates of Olympus, Sugar Rush, and others.</p>
<p>You can filter the games by provider as well. Empire.io has all of them listed: Evolution, Pragmatic Play, Hacksaw Gaming, and many others are available. </p>
<p>Like most casinos, Empire.io also offers a fun mode for most slots. This means you can try them out without risking your money before you’re ready. </p>
<p>Slots are also often part of tournaments. For example, you can participate in the Bet Blitz tournament, where the amount you wager places you on a leaderboard. The highest-ranking players share a prize pool worth USDT 500. Keep in mind you have to opt in for this tournament – you are not automatically considered part of it just by playing.</p>
<h3><strong>Roulette</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-roulette-sites.htm">Roulette is a must-have for many good casinos</a>. It’s no wonder that the Empire.io casino games number 35 roulette options. This includes Lightning Roulette by Evolution, which was awarded Game of the Year at the American Gambling Awards 2022.</p>
<p>There is also Roulette by Onetouch, a Live &#8211; Lobby Roulette by Pragmatic Play, and a myriad of other options. However, keep in mind that most providers don’t offer a fun mode for Roulette, so you will have to sign up to play.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332868/empire-io-roulette.jpg" alt="Empire casino roulette games" /></figure>
<p>Generally speaking, Empire.io separates roulette into two categories: Roulette and Live Roulette. Don’t let this confuse you: they’re the same games, offered in a slightly different order.</p>
<p>The biggest difference, however, is that Empire.io offers Bombay Club. This is a live dealer for high rollers. You can find Bombay Live games under the Live Roulette tab, as well as a separate Bombay Club section.</p>
<p>Some roulette games are also offered in different languages, like Brazilian Portuguese, Turkish, and Italian, among others. Empire.io reviews agree: this is a great approach for inclusivity for non-English speaking players.</p>
<h3><strong>Blackjack</strong></h3>
<p>Similar to roulette, Empire.io offers a total of 36 blackjack games. The same goes for the categories: there’s Blackjack and Live Blackjack, but no tangible difference between the two.</p>
<p>Most of the available blackjack options are offered by Evolution and Pragmatic Play. The two are known to be among the best providers in the casino space, so players are guaranteed to find something they like.</p>
<p>For example, Pragmatic Play offers several Blackjack and Blackjack Azure tables. In other words, you don’t have to worry about places opening up before you can play.</p>
<p>As there is no Empire.io promo code necessary, you can play blackjack just as easily with your welcome bonus. </p>
<p>All in all, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-blackjack-sites.htm">Empire.io has ranked among our best blackjack sites for this year</a>.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332861/empire-io-bombay-club.jpg" alt="Empire salon prive" /></figure>
<h3><strong>Poker</strong></h3>
<p>Talking about another must in the casino industry, Empire.io offers seven different poker options. This may be too little for passionate poker players, but for more casual ones, it’s actually perfect.</p>
<p>This way, you can try your hand at Texas Hold’Em or Caribbean Stud without feeling like you’re missing out on too many other options.</p>
<p>Our Empire.io casino review found that the poker games offered – from providers like Evolution and Onetouch – are generally quite popular. Their interfaces are easy to understand and likely familiar to veteran players. </p>
<p>The Bombay Club doesn’t include a poker option. This means you won’t be able to play the game in a specially crafted high stakes environment. On the other hand, stakes can get pretty high outside of the club too – although maybe less exclusive-feeling.</p>
<h3><strong>Live Dealer</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from the games we’ve mentioned before, Empire.io’s Live Dealer includes games like Dragon Tiger, Baccarat, and Cash or Crash, among others.</p>
<p>In total, there are more than 140 games under the Live Dealer tab on the website. </p>
<p>This also includes the same games offered in different languages, as we’ve mentioned before.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Games</strong></h3>
<p>Among other games, Empire.io also offers some ever-popular crash games like Aviator, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crash-gambling-sites.htm">available throughout the industry</a>.</p>
<p>Our Empire.io review found that the number of games offered is in line with most similar casinos. You are likely to find all the popular casino games offered here as well. Combined with their promotions, this makes Empire.io a great casino for players of all experience levels.</p>
<h2><strong>Empire.io Sports Betting</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Figuring out Empire.io’s sports betting section can be a little tricky. This is where our review comes in.</p>
<p>Browsing their website, you may notice that there is actually no separate section for the sportsbook. This doesn’t mean they don’t have one (despite what some other Empire.io reviews claim).</p>
<p>The trick is in the fact that they only <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">offer sports betting</a> from the Parlaybay provider. You can either find it in the All Games section of the site, or through their sports promotion. Keep in mind this isn’t really a promotion at all – it’s just a way that they highlighted the sportsbook so it’s easier to find.</p>
<p>Simply put, sports betting is treated like just another of Empire.io casino games.</p>
<h2><strong>Available Sports &amp; Markets</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332862/empire-io-sportsbook.jpg" alt="Empire sports betting" /></figure>
<p>The number of sports and markets is quite limited. The only sports offered are basketball, cricket, football, ice hockey, and handball. The platform does not offer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-esports-betting-sites.htm">esports betting</a>.</p>
<p>This can be a little limiting for sports fans, who may be looking for a more varied array of sports. However, for more casual players, this can actually make it easier to get into sports betting. The sports they offer are among the most popular in the world. In other words, the learning curve is actually quite friendly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the number of markets offered is much better. The actual number will depend on the sport you choose and the competition being played. UEFA Champions League matches will always have more markets than any ice hockey game.</p>
<p>Although Empire.io bonus codes are equally unavailable for sports betting, you can use your welcome bonus to try out this feature.</p>
<p>To further increase the number of markets offered, Empire.io also has STACK’EM, which is a bet builder feature. STACK’EM games will open one hour or less before the start of an event, which gives you time to figure out your strategy.</p>
<p>There is also STREAK, which is a game mode based on rounds where you try to hit the best accumulator in a fixed number of rounds.</p>
<h2><strong>Empire.io Odds </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Odds at Empire.io are quite competitive: they’re very similar, if not identical, to odds at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">other top crypto-based sportsbooks</a>. As the odds depend on the provider and not necessarily the platform, this means they’re the same across all platforms using the same provider.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, that means Empire.io more than makes up for the lack of different sports through competitive odds and a good range of markets.</p>
<h2><strong>What Software does Empire.io Use?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332869/empire-io-providers.jpg" alt="Empire gaming providers" /></figure>
<p>According to our Empire.io review, the software game providers available at the casino are among the best in the industry. Notable names include providers like Pragmatic Play, Spribe, Hacksaw Gaming, Onetouch, Nolimit City, and others.</p>
<p>All of these providers have several things in common. The first is that they offer a wide variety of games, where you can choose from a huge number of popular titles. The RTPs for their games are also publicly visible, which makes for a more transparent and trustworthy approach. Finally, these providers are all safe to use and adhere to the strictest security policies. </p>
<p>Although it may seem like these properties may only interest very experienced players, they’re especially important for newbies. This means that you can learn the ropes at any game and generally find your footing in the casino world without the risk of fraud or deception.</p>
<p>As all the providers accept cryptocurrencies, your privacy is also assured.</p>
<h2><strong>Empire.io Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332863/empire-io-deposit.jpg" alt="Empire crypto deposits and withdrawals" /></figure>
<p>Empire.io offers a decent range of accepted cryptocurrencies. You can use eight of the most popular coins to deposit and play at this casino. They are bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), ether (ETH), dogecoin (DOGE), TRON (TRX), litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), and XRP (XRP).</p>
<p>Both deposits and withdrawals are (nearly) instantaneous. They only depend on getting a certain number of blockchain confirmations before they’re credited to your account. This makes it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-instant-withdrawal-bitcoin-casinos.htm">one of the best instant withdrawal casinos currently available</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible that they take longer if the network is congested, but this is beyond the casino’s control.</p>
<p>Empire.io does not charge any deposit or withdrawal fees. You will only need to pay the network fee to send the funds to and from your personal wallet.</p>
<p>Any bonuses claimed through an Empire.io promo code or otherwise are subject to wagering requirements before they can be withdrawn. </p>

<h2><strong>Empire.io Interface &amp; User Experience</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Empire.io boasts an extremely simple interface. Signing up is quick and easy: all you have to do is enter your email address and set a password. Click the captcha button, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you will have to verify your email address before you can withdraw your funds. Other than that, the platform does not require you to provide any ID for KYC purposes.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332864/empire-io-sign-up.jpg" alt="Empire signup tab" /></figure>
<p>Once you’ve signed up, you can deposit your funds by clicking on the Deposit button in the top right. Choose the currency you want, then copy the account link you get from the platform into your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">personal crypto wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Withdrawals are equally simple. Just choose the currency you want to withdraw, paste your address (be sure to double check!), and wait for it to appear in your wallet.</p>
<p>Navigating the Empire.io casino games is also quite straightforward. If you’re unsure from which category to start, head on to All Games.</p>
<p>Games are sorted by popularity by default. You can also sort them by RTP to see the best opportunities, by volatility, hit ratio, or simply alphabetically.</p>
<p>Find the promotions and tournaments currently available in the lower third on the left side of the screen.</p>
<h2><strong>Does Empire.io Have a Mobile App?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Empire.io does not currently have a mobile app. Also, it is not clear from their website whether they intend to launch a mobile app in the future. </p>
<p>However, the website is optimized for smaller screens as well as desktops. This means you can still take your games with you and play on your mobile phone or tablet.</p>
<h2><strong>Empire.io Security</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/126065/332870/empire-io-verified.jpg" alt="Empire Gaming Curacao license" /></figure>
<p>Empire.io is licensed through the Government of Curaçao. Their license number is 365/JAZ, which can be checked online. </p>
<p>Of course, this is only the first step in ascertaining the security of a casino. Another is the way they’re offering their games. </p>
<p>We’ve already mentioned the providers Empire.io uses. Their previous track record shows that they’re trustworthy and secure, with the safety of the end user always in sight.</p>
<p>Another security measure Empire.io has implemented is that you can’t withdraw for 48 hours after changing your password. This ensures that you have time to reclaim your account if it has been hacked. This way, once you get a hacked account back in time, you won’t find it drained of funds. </p>
<p>With no forced KYC, you’re even safe from having to disclose your identity. Generally speaking, Empire.io reviews find it to be one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">safest crypto casinos</a> currently available.</p>
<h2><strong>Empire.io Pros &amp; Cons </strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<p>Reel Crypto is a newcomer to the crypto casino space, having only launched in 2023. It offers a wide range of games and betting options, including a sportsbook and a live casino. </p>
<p>With your first deposit of a minimum EUR 50 doubled up to the value of EUR 10,000 (and an extra 50 spins if you deposit EUR 100 or more!), the casino makes creating an account with them incredibly attractive. Add to that the fact that they’re licensed and require no KYC, and they tick all our basic casino must-haves.</p>
<p>Is this the casino for you? Read our Reel Crypto casino review to learn more.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Reel Crypto Casino?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As its name implies, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/reelcrypto/">Reel Crypto</a> is a crypto-focused casino. This implies all the advantages offered by crypto, including security and privacy. With no KYC, not only is the sign up process significantly more private, but it is also extremely quick. Even though they’re a new player, this means they’re already vying for a place on our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-anonymous-casinos.htm">best anonymous casinos list</a>.</p>
<p>The casino also places great value on customer security. It is licensed by the Governor of Curaçao under the Master Gaming License number #5536/JAZ. </p>
<p>The cryptocurrencies supported by Reel Crypto include bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), dogecoin (DOGE), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT), TRON (TRX), XRP (XRP), and Dai (DAI).</p>
<p>Reel Crypto’s casino includes hundreds of slot games that can be searched by themselves or filtered by their provider, along with live dealers and a sportsbook. The latter includes more than thirty sports with thousands of live events, as well as virtual sports. From traditional soccer, to Formula 1, to even Gaelic Football, any sports fan will find their dream sportsbook here.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329339/reelcrypto-promotions.jpg" alt="Reel Crypto Casino" /></figure>
<p>Most of their casino games have a Play for Fun option. This means you can test out any game you’d like without committing your funds to it before you’re certain.</p>
<p>Reel Crypto’s welcome bonus may have a relatively high deposit minimum of EUR 50 (EUR 100 if you also want to get your free spins), but it’s also pretty generous, doubling your initial deposit for up to EUR 10,000. On the other hand, bonus options for existing users are pretty limited. At the time of writing, there was only a weekly 10% cashback, up to EUR 10,000, offered to all users. </p>
<p>However, users should also keep in mind the casino’s newcomer status. We hope that, as time progresses and more users join the platform, the casino will decide to add more loyalty rewards.</p>

<h2>Reel Crypto Bonuses</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>For many users, bonuses are the first thing that draws them to a casino. Here, we will cover the bonuses offered at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/reelcrypto/">Reel Crypto</a>.</p>
<h3>Reel Crypto Welcome Bonus</h3>
<p>When first depositing at Reel Crypto, you can double it as long as you deposit at least EUR 50. Additionally, if your first deposit exceeds EUR 100, you will get 50 free spins on the Sweet Bonanza slot game. These will be credited daily for five days, with 10 spins each day. This way, you don’t have to worry about spending them all at once!</p>
<p>To be eligible for the welcome bonus, users need to make their first deposit within a month of opening the account. The bonus can’t be used to bet on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-betting-sites.htm">crypto sportsbook</a>, however. </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that the Reel Crypto welcome bonus has a 40x wagering requirement before it can be withdrawn. </p>
<p>Slots will contribute 100% to the wagering requirement. Live game shows contribute 50%, and other live games will contribute a mere 20%.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casino-bonuses.htm">crypto casino bonus</a> amount (and any other bonuses on the casino) is stated in the euro fiat currency, the total amount is not dependent on the volatility of crypto prices. This means that users can always depend on the amount shown, even if the crypto markets are in red at that time.</p>
<p>There is no cap on winnings or withdrawals, but keep in mind that the maximum bet value for contributing to wagering is EUR 3.</p>
<h3>10% Cashback</h3>
<p>For existing customers, there’s the option of a 10% cashback on all their losses on a weekly basis. The minimum cashback is EUR 1 and it cannot exceed EUR 10,000. Customers need to make a deposit of at least EUR 20 to be eligible for this promotion. If you’re quite unlucky while playing, Reel Crypto will be giving back to you! Every Friday at 12 UTC, the cashback will be added to your account.  </p>
<p>Aside from the Reel Crypto welcome bonus and the cashback, there are no more promos at the time of writing. </p>
<h2>Reel Crypto Bonus Codes</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Luckily for Reel Crypto users, the available bonuses and promotions do not require them to enter any bonus codes. There is also no need to use a referral link (nor is there an option to gain something by referring your friends). This can be considered a blessing in disguise: you can’t lose out on a bonus simply because you forgot to enter a code. For the Reel Crypto welcome bonus, all you need to do is deposit more than EUR 50 into your account. For the cashback, you simply have to play and they will give you part of your losses back.</p>
<p>Still, it is interesting to note that when signing up, the platform asks you to enter a referral link if you have one. This could mean that they plan to add a referral program relatively soon. If so, it could be a welcome addition to the currently available bonuses.</p>
<h3>Reel Crypto No Deposit Bonus Codes</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, there were unfortunately no bonus codes for no deposit bonuses. Both available bonuses can only be claimed with a high enough deposit. The absolute minimum for the cashback is EUR 20, while the welcome bonus is only available on deposits EUR 50 and higher.</p>
<h2>Games Available at Reel Crypto</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>For a newcomer, Reel Crypto offers a very decent spread of casino games. Here, we will take a look at some of them.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329340/reelcrypto-slots.jpg" alt="Reel Crypto Casino game offering " /></figure>
<h3>Slots</h3>
<p>Slots are one of the most popular game types in crypto casinos, for a good reason. The simplicity of placing a wager and watching to see whether your luck holds is hard to beat. </p>
<p>At Reel Crypto, players can try thousands of slot games from a wide variety of providers. </p>
<p>In the Featured tab, players can find the most popular games on the platform. This includes Book of Ra (both the traditional and the Deluxe version), Lucky Lady Charm Deluxe, Lord of the Ocean, and others.</p>
<p>Players can also browse by provider name. Under the Providers tab, they can see all the games offered by big names like Pragmatic Play, Hacksaw Gaming, OneTouch, and more.</p>
<p>Unsure what to pick (and how it works)? Try the game that piques your interest with the Play for Fun option. This way, you can figure out how it looks and works without betting real money.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most popular games:</p>
<h3>Book of Ra</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329341/book-of-ra-slots.jpg" alt="Book of Ra casino game" /></figure>
<p>Offered by Novomatic, Book of Ra is an insanely popular slot game. It features 10 lines and five reels, and a fixed jackpot of up to 5,000x your stake and an RTP of 96%. </p>
<p>The recognizable graphics make this online version of the game feel quite similar to a physical slot machine. </p>
<h3>Gates of Olympus</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329342/gates-of-olympus-slots.jpg" alt="Gates of Olympus casino game" /></figure>
<p>This Ancient Greece-inspired slot game is offered by Pragmatic Play with a default RTP of 96.5%. The potential of 5,000x, like in Book of Ra, is actually down from a previously advertised 21,100x.</p>
<p>The game also features a pay-anywhere system, which means you get paid out wherever the symbols land. This is in opposition to being forced to have them aligned horizontally, vertically or any other way.</p>
<h3>Sweet Bonanza</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329343/sweet-bonanza-slots.jpg" alt="Sweet Bonanza gambling game" /></figure>
<p>It should come as no surprise that Reel Crypto offers this massively popular game on their platform. They also offer a myriad of other games with the “sweet” prefix that use a similar visual design. However, the classic Sweet Bonanza remains one of the most played slot games from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The fruits and candies make for a very pleasing visual experience. This is only improved with a 96.5% RTP. The gameplay has a tumble feature: when winning combinations are removed, they get replaced with new symbols that can trigger extra wins. </p>
<h3>Patrick’s Coin: Hold the Spin</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329344/patricks-coin.jpg" alt="Patrick's Coin game" /></figure>
<p>This game by Gamzix features a leprechaun theme with a jackpot bonus round. The game has a 96% RTP and a special symbol, the Wild, that can boost your winnings tremendously.</p>
<p>To trigger the bonus round, you need to land at least six coins simultaneously. When the round starts, all coins that triggered it will remain in the same places and you get three respins. </p>
<h3>The Dog House</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329345/the-dog-house-slots.jpg" alt="The Dog House gambling game" /></figure>
<p>Another go-to game for many players, offered by Pragmatic Play, it comes with five reels, three rows, and a total of 20 paylines. The game’s maximum payouts go up to 6,750x the stake. </p>
<p>The game also has a feature round, triggered by landing a scatter on reels 1, 3, and 5. The free spins round offers between 9 and 27 extra spins.</p>
<p>All in all, players who are looking for highly popular slot games will find all of them on Reel Crypto. There is also a very good selection of lesser known, but still excellent slot games that are well worth trying.</p>
<h3>Roulette</h3>
<p>Reel Crypto offers an impressive 41 roulette games. These include a variety of games from European Roulette to Three Wheel Roulette. The former is offered by several different providers, letting players choose the one they prefer to the rest. There are also live roulette dealers.</p>
<h3>Blackjack</h3>
<p>Just like with roulette, Reel Crypto has a decent variety of blackjack games on the platform. 64 different titles are available, including Blackjack Bucuresti, Blackjack Lucky Sevens, but also a live dealer version.</p>
<h3>Poker</h3>
<p>Poker is a fan favorite among card games, and it is well-represented on Reel Crypto. With options ranging from Video Poker to Teen Patti and everything in between, the platform offers all the games users can’t do without. </p>
<p>The casino also offers a live poker lobby.</p>
<h3>Other Games</h3>
<p>Reel Crypto also offers a number of other games that we haven’t mentioned. There’s also Baccarat among card games, but also crash games like Aviator and arcade games like Plinko.</p>
<p>Their live casino also has game shows like Monopoly and Wheel of Fortune. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Live Dealer Games at Reel Crypto</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329346/live-casino-lobbies.jpg" alt="Live casino gaming lobbies" /></figure>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/reelcrypto/">Reel Crypto</a> provides live dealers for pretty much all stable casino games. The advantages of real-time games include being able to play whenever you want, at any place. </p>
<p>The games are offered by Ezugi and Evolution, both of which are regulated by the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UK Gambling Commission</a>.</p>
<p>There are also live game shows available at Reel Crypto. This includes Crazy Time, Dream Catcher, Wheel of Fortune, and similar titles.</p>
<h2>Reel Crypto Software</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The game providers at Reel Crypto all include reputable names, such as Ezugi, Evolution and Pragmatic Play. Each of these holds a license from the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>In other words, the games are both provably fair and random. </p>
<p>Other providers on the platform include Hacksaw Gaming, Relax Gaming, NoLimit City, and NetEnt, among others.</p>
<h2>Reel Crypto Deposits &amp; Withdrawals</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>As its name implies, Reel Crypto is a crypto-specific gambling site. In a game, money will usually be shown in fiat, either in US dollars or euros. This is due to the rules from their providers, as some of them don’t support the display of cryptocurrencies in their games.</p>
<p>Additionally, they state that it is easier to keep track of your wagers and winnings in fiat. In short, showing everything in fiat ensures consistency across all games.</p>
<p>However, when funding your account, know that the casino only accepts cryptocurrencies. Here is a list of the accepted coins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</li>
<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Ether (ETH)</li>
<li>Tether (USDTE &amp; USDTT)</li>
<li>TRON (TRX)</li>
<li>XRP (XRP)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>BNB (BNB)</li>
<li>Dai (DAI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Deposits are extremely simple. After clicking the red Deposit button that can be found on the left hand side of the screen, users will need to choose the coins they want. Whichever they choose, the platform automatically generates a wallet, complete with an address, tied to their account. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329347/deposit.jpg" alt="Online casino crypto wallet" /></figure>
<p>Each option also shows the minimum deposit amount for each cryptocurrency. All you need to do is copy the wallet address into the corresponding field when sending from your personal wallet. Make sure to double-check that you copied everything properly!</p>
<p>You can also use the provided QR code for quicker and more secure address copying.</p>
<p>Reel Crypto does not charge any deposit or withdrawal fees. Users only have to pay the required mining fees when sending their funds.</p>
<h3>Deposit Terms</h3>
<p>As we’ve already mentioned, each deposit option has a minimum amount that is stated when you click on that coin. Here are the minimum deposit amounts for each accepted cryptocurrency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC): 0.0001</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH): 0.001</li>
<li>Litecoin (LTC): 0.01</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE): 1</li>
<li>Ether (ETH): 0.01</li>
<li>Tether (USDTE): 5</li>
<li>Tether (USDTT): 1</li>
<li>TRON (TRX): 10</li>
<li>XRP (XRP): 0.001</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA): 1</li>
<li>BNB (BNB): 0.01</li>
<li>Dai (DAI): 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, to receive your welcome bonus, make sure the fiat equivalent of your first deposit exceeds EUR 50 (or EUR 100 for free spins). </p>
<p>Deposits are credited automatically, as soon as they reach the required number of blockchain transactions. Bitcoin is the only coin where this may last between 10 minutes and an hour. The rest of the coins will be available in your account within a few short minutes at most.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal Terms</h3>
<p>Each cryptocurrency also has its minimum withdrawal stated on the website. The minimum withdrawal amount for almost all of them is the same as the minimum deposit amount. The only exception is BTC, where the minimum withdrawal is BTC 0.0002.</p>
<p>There is no fiat equivalent of a minimum withdrawal – the only important minimum amounts are stated in each cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>There are, however, maximum payout limits. On a daily basis, you can request up to EUR 5,000 to be paid out. This becomes EUR 10,000 in one week, and EUR 50,000 in one month.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that requesting a withdrawal before you’ve completed all the wagering requirements will result in forfeiting all your bonus funds. </p>
<p>Withdrawals are mostly processed right away (although requesting a large sum to be paid out may take up to 24 hours).</p>
<h2>Reel Crypto Sports Betting</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Sports enthusiasts will be happy to know that Reel Crypto offers a decent sportsbook on its gambling site. It is located under the tab simply titled Sports on the left hand side of the screen. </p>
<p>Let’s see what the Reel Crypto sportsbook offers.</p>
<h3>Betting Markets</h3>
<p>Reel Crypto offers a decent range of betting markets. The sports include everything from basketball and tennis to snooker and chess. There are also quite a few esports games, like PUBG, League of Legends, Valorant, and Counter Strike.</p>
<p>The platform also offers <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/in-play-or-in-running-betting">in-play betting</a>, which means you’re not prevented from placing new wagers simply because a game has begun. The markets and odds change depending on how the game goes, making for a more dynamic betting experience.</p>
<p>The total number and types of betting markets will depend on the popularity of the sport. For example, in soccer, you can bet on the total number of goals, first goal, and whether both teams will score. </p>
<p>There is also the draw no bet market, which means that your wager is returned to you if there is no winner.</p>
<p>All in all, Reel Crypto offers a range of betting markets to satisfy most sports betting fans.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329348/reelcrypto-sportsbook.jpg" alt="Reel Crypto sports betting " /></figure>
<h3>Betting Odds</h3>
<p>The sports betting odds are quite competitive. The fact that they’re available in-play as well means that they’re constantly changing and evolving with the game. The odds are displayed in decimal format, also known as European.</p>
<p>Reel Crypto also offers a bet builder feature for some of its markets. This lets players maximize their potential winnings and build odds that would otherwise not be available.</p>
<p>There are also some preset combo markets available. For example, you can bet on both teams to score, as well as the total number of goals.</p>
<h2>Reel Crypto User Experience</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Reel Crypto boasts an incredibly easy-to-use website. Even if this is your first time signing up with a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">Bitcoin or crypto casino</a>, you should not have trouble getting around.</p>
<p>The process of signing up is incredibly simple. You will only need to provide an email address and set a username and password combo. There is no KYC and you don’t even have to verify your address before depositing your funds.</p>
<p>Additionally, many of the games that offer a demo version don’t even need you to sign up before trying them. </p>
<p>To navigate the website, just use the left hand side of your screen. The games are classified as either Casino, Live Casino, or Sportsbook. You will also find the tab with all the currently available promotions here.</p>
<p>In any of the game tabs, you can search for the games using a search bar. You can also browse the available games, categorized based on their type. </p>
<p>If you’re stuck and would like help, the Help tab on the left side will take you to their FAQ section. If that doesn’t cover it, the Chat option in the lower right side of the screen will put you in touch with a customer support agent.</p>
<h2>Reel Crypto Mobile App</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>At the time of writing, Reel Crypto did not have a mobile app. However, the browser-based version is fully functional even when used in mobile browsers. This means that you can access the casino from your phone or tablet with no issue.</p>
<p>All the functionalities of the desktop version are seamlessly transferred to mobile as well. You will be able to deposit funds, place withdrawal requests, and play whichever games you want. </p>
<p>Everything is in pretty much the same place as on your desktop, but optimized for smaller screens. So even if you’re used to finding your favorite slot games in one spot, you may very well find them there on mobile as well.</p>
<h2>Reel Crypto Licensing &amp; Security</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329351/licensing.jpg" alt="Reel Crypto Casino license" /></figure>
<p>Safety is not optional at Reel Crypto. This new casino has already secured its license, issued by the Governor of Curaçao, under the number #5536/JAZ. Curaçao has its own <a href="https://www.curacao-egaming.com/">e-gaming website</a>, where all license numbers can be verified separately for the players’ peace of mind. </p>
<p>With no forced KYC, Reel Crypto places customer privacy at the forefront. Practically, this means your data is safer than ever – as it’s not even stored on the website. </p>
<p>There is also no need to offer more of your data to withdraw funds. The <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/public-private-keys-cryptography">inherent privacy of public and private keys</a> means that you don’t need to verify your identity. </p>
<p>Finally, as we’ve previously mentioned, the gaming providers at Reel Crypto are tried and true. These are all big names that have an excellent reputation in the industry.</p>
<h2>Reel Crypto Pros &amp; Cons</h2><span class="replacer"></span>

<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Great selection of games</li>
<li>Reputable gaming providers</li>
<li>Licensed, no KYC</li>
<li>10% weekly cashback for all players</li>
<li>No deposit and withdrawal fees</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>How to Sign Up &amp; Play at Reel Crypto</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/reelcrypto/">Getting started at Reel Crypto</a> is actually quite straightforward. Simply follow the steps we outline below.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Register a Reel Crypto Account</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329349/reelcrypto-register.jpg" alt="Reel Crypto Casino sign up form " /></figure>
<p>To register an account, you just need to provide an email address, and set a username and password combo. </p>
<p>You don’t even have to verify your address to start playing. It is used for account recovery if you forget your password.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Deposit Crypto</h3>
<p>Depositing crypto is also very simple. Just click the Deposit button and choose the cryptocurrency you want to deposit. Then, copy the address into your own wallet’s Send-to field.</p>
<p>Your minimum first deposit only really depends on the minimums listed on the website and in our review. But if you want to get the Reel Crypto welcome bonus, make sure you deposit at least EUR 50 the first time around.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Search for a Game</h3>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124680/329350/search.jpg" alt="Reel Crypto Casino game offering " /></figure>
<p>After choosing Casino, Live Casino or Sports, it’s time to find a game. Around the middle of the screen on the right side, there’s a search bar. If you have a specific game you’re looking for, this is your best bet.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can browse the existing games. They’re organized by a number of different criteria, so it should not be difficult to find what you’re looking for.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Gamble Responsibly </h3>
<p>One of the <a href="https://www.begambleaware.org/advice-if-you-are-gambling">most important tenets of gambling</a> is to never wager more than you can afford to lose. If you feel like you’re spending more than you should, take some time to recharge away from the casino. That said, good luck and have fun!</p>
<h3>Step 5: Withdraw Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>Another fun part of playing is getting to claim your profits. To withdraw, simply enter the amount you want and enter the address of your crypto wallet. It will take a few blockchain confirmations until the balance shows up. However, this is usually just a matter of minutes.</p>

With the advent of blockchain 2.0 (which is when blockchain gained its first use case aside from Bitcoin in 2014), smart contracts have been an invaluable addition to the technology. While highly technical in nature, they do not have to be difficult to understand.</p><p>In this guide, we will take you through the basics of smart contracts. You will learn what they are, how they work, where they’re applicable, and even the basics of writing one.</p><h2><strong>What Is a Smart Contract</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>In the simplest sense, smart contracts are just a programmed version of your usual contract. Its purpose is to automatically trigger a previously settled-upon contract when all the preconditions have been met. Since every condition has to be manually programmed to execute, this can significantly reduce the amount of fine print designed to favor one party, even at the expense of the other.</p><p>Although smart contracts, as we refer to them now, rose to prominence with programmable blockchain implementations, they are much older than that. Computer scientist, lawyer, and cryptographer Nick Szabo first proposed smart contracts as a concept in the 90s. He described them as “a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.” Outside of their current implementations, smart contracts are present elsewhere: vending machines are considered a rudimentary version of the technology, as they follow the general principle that with the right input, a certain output is guaranteed.</p><p>Despite their name, smart contracts are not necessarily a valid, binding agreement in the eyes of the law, the way traditional contracts tend to be. However, in blockchain implementation, they don’t need to be. The interpretation by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology defines them as a “collection of code and data (sometimes referred to as functions and state) that is deployed using cryptographically signed transactions on the blockchain network.” This is also the definition by which Ethereum and similar blockchains operate.</p><p>For those who understand <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">what blockchain is</a>, it can seem obvious how smart contracts fit into the architecture of a blockchain. In a completely decentralized space, where nobody holds significant amounts of power, there is no place for intermediaries and third parties that handle compliance and consensus. As our aforementioned guide explains, consensus is reached through preset mechanisms that do not rely on human intervention. The same is true for compliance and execution of programs: smart contracts are programmed implementations of these concepts that remove the need for people to hold that kind of power.</p><h2><strong>How Does a Smart Contract Work</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>However, knowing what a smart contract is doesn’t necessarily explain how it works.</p><p>Most simply, smart contracts are made up of different functions that are defined on them. Users interact with them by sending a transaction that triggers a certain function. Each of these functions is defined in detail, so users can understand exactly what it is that they’re about to do.</p><p>The users of the network define smart contracts. Anyone who can code in the smart contract language can write their own, as long as they have enough native coins to deploy. The cost itself depends on the network you’re deploying on and its stipulations.</p><p>A real-world example would be a trade agreement. Once both parties have hashed out the details (what each is getting in return, the stipulations, any factors that might make them renegotiate the deal), they would usually find a neutral third party to ensure everything is done by the letter. However, neutral third parties cost money—and they can’t always be trusted to remain neutral or simply not to try to gain their own advantage from the situation. The most simple solution would be removing this third party completely. But who will act as a mediator then?</p><p>This is why people have always preferred the neutrality that only machines can achieve. The current technological advances still don&#8217;t see machines having their own preferences and interests, so they&#8217;re often believed the best solution to these problems. In other words, programming a smart contract lets all parties involved hash out the details of the trade publicly and transparently (as smart contracts are unable to do something that was not explicitly coded in), thus preventing potential malfeasance. This also reduces overall costs, as deploying and later triggering a smart contract is relatively low compared to lawyer costs.</p><p>Smart contracts guarantee that everything will be done in the exact way that it was coded. As they’re not very complex programs, these codes can often be read and understood with some basic programming knowledge. This is important for keeping everything above ground and facilitating a good working relationship with other participants in the network.</p><h2><strong>What Can Smart Contracts Be Used For</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>One of the biggest advantages of smart contracts is that they can be used for virtually anything, as long as they can be programmed. Of course, some use cases are more common than others. Some of the best examples include:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital identity:</strong> in a time of dubious privacy on the internet, there is a concern about what data you’re sharing with companies whose websites you’re accessing. This can be easily digitized through smart contracts, where it could share your preferences for content curation purposes without actually disclosing your personal information.</li><li><strong>Securities:</strong> the financial sector as a whole suffers from a lot of friction between different parties, especially when it comes to holding and trading securities. By automating everything through smart contracts, intermediaries could be removed completely. The program would then take over, paying out dividends and/or other automatic payments, managing liability, and streamlining the workflow.</li><li><strong>Loans and mortgages:</strong> these things are often the source of frustration for many. Implementing smart contract payments would mean bringing down the overall cost that usually goes to the third party, maintaining a beneficial interest rate, and ensuring there is no fine print that can be taken advantage of. Additionally, setting up automatic monthly payments can further simplify the whole ordeal for all participants.</li><li><strong>Supply chain:</strong> as one of the best-known use cases for blockchain, smart contracts are also invaluable when it comes to supply chain management. From inventory tracking to automatic updates to all concerned parties, implementing smart contracts can improve transparency and significantly reduce room for potential fraud.</li><li><strong>Escrow:</strong> as with other activities that require third-party involvement, escrow is also one of those that would benefit from automatization. With smart contracts, funds are held in a safe location until all conditions for their release have been met. This can almost eliminate the risk of theft and fraud while simultaneously keeping everything fully transparent and, perhaps most of all, affordable.</li><li><strong>Health systems:</strong> medical data is highly sensitive, and most jurisdictions have laws that protect it from unauthorized access. Using smart contracts can not only protect that data but also lets individuals decide who can get access to it. Ultimately, people could provide medical researchers with access to their data for a fee, eliminating a significant amount of ethical concerns for all parties involved.</li><li><strong>Salaries:</strong> businesses keeping salaried employees could save significant money by paying them out on an automatic basis. Even if they have to take days off into account, these changes can be tweaked quickly and easily. The concept could work on hourly employees as well.</li></ul><p>The list of smart contract use cases is far from exhaustive. However, it serves only to showcase the wide range of applications beyond what many people think of when they hear about the technology. With the right infrastructure, smart contracts could go far beyond the use cases outlined here.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of Smart Contracts</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Many of the benefits smart contracts offer to the way you do your business can be deduced from what we’ve shown by now. On the other hand, some go beyond what may be obvious at first. Let’s take a closer look at them.</p><ul><li><strong>Trust:</strong> or, perhaps more accurately, trustlessness means that you do not need to implicitly trust anyone that the conditions you’ve set will be executed. As a smart contract has no autonomy of its own, you can rest assured that everything will happen exactly as it is written.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> cryptography, the concept upon which blockchain (and smart contracts, by extension) is built, keeps everything vastly more secure than many other technological solutions.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> using smart contracts is a significant step up from manually handling everything that can be automated. Especially in the case of intermediaries, which can take their time depending on their own practices, moving everything to smart contracts can be just the timesaver your business needed.</li><li><strong>Savings:</strong> going by the same logic as with the aspect of speed, removing third party interference also saves you the money you would pay for their services.</li><li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> not relying on intermediaries gives you more power to decide, by yourself or with another interested party, exactly what your smart contract should do. Additionally, the chance of someone erring (or even manipulating) is significantly reduced with fewer participants.</li><li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> unless a mistake is preprogrammed into the smart contract, it is physically incapable of doing anything other than what is written in its code.</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> not only will you be able to read the smart contract and see if it has been written in accordance with what you wanted or needed, but the fact that it is stored on the blockchain means that all the relevant data will also be visible for posterity. For businesses, this can speed up auditing processes.</li><li><strong>Ease of understanding (and use):</strong> it’s true that code can be written in incredibly confusing ways. However, high-quality code will be easy to understand and use, which means it will be far easier than poring over long, dense legal documents.</li></ul><p>Other benefits of using smart contracts will depend on your personal use case. Most importantly, all of them have one thing in common: they make everything easier.</p><h2><strong>Potential Drawbacks</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Of course, no technology is a panacea. This is especially true for blockchain and smart contracts. As they’re still relatively new and address long-standing problems across many industries, they’re often expected to be able to do much more than they realistically can. Here are some issues smart contracts may face:</p><ul><li><strong>Not legally binding:</strong> in spite of their name, smart contracts are not necessarily actual contracts. They may not hold up in a court of law, but this may change on a case-by-case basis.</li><li><strong>Regulatory uncertainty:</strong> in the same vein, as the technology is so new, there are often no government regulations in place. Depending on the type of transaction, they might not be necessary—but they might also be critical, so navigating these legal issues can be a chore.</li><li><strong>Taxation:</strong> similarly, how do you tax-smart contract transactions? While some may have their precedent in traditional finance, the ascent of cryptocurrencies has brought some new factors into play.</li><li><strong>Addressing bugs:</strong> no code is perfect, and bugs happen, even to the best coders. Some of them may not be noticed until it’s too late, and transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. In other words, mistakes can be costly.</li><li><strong>Rescinding contracts:</strong> as smart contracts are quite literal, there is often no way to rescind them the way you would with a traditional contract, i.e., in court.</li><li><strong>Not everyone can read code:</strong> simply put, not everyone knows the basics of coding. While theoretically, smart contracts should be more straightforward than documents on paper, as they don’t permit fine print. However, if you can’t read the code, anyone can write anything they want with you none the wiser.</li><li><strong>They can’t get real-world information:</strong> smart contracts can’t access information from outside the blockchain because that might jeopardize consensus. So-called oracles are used to overcome this obstacle.</li></ul><p>The importance of each of these drawbacks, just like the benefits we listed, depends on what you’re actually using smart contracts for. Still, being aware of these pros and cons helps make an informed decision if you’re looking into using smart contracts.</p><h2><strong>What Is An Oracle?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While talking about blockchain and smart contracts, we stated several times that the goal of both, among other things, is to eliminate reliance on third parties. However, there are some situations in which this cannot be avoided. One of those situations is when you need real-world information to feed into smart contracts without constantly looking for it manually.</p><p>Blockchain oracles are such third parties. They act as the link between on-chain data, which is the blockchain, and off-chain, or what we call the real world. This helps broaden the scope of smart contracts. Without oracles, smart contracts would only be able to operate with the information they can get from the blockchain itself, which isn’t a lot.</p><p>To keep the data from being manipulated, oracles are also often decentralized. This means that they’re all sending the same data, and the data that the majority sent is taken as correct. If an oracle is found to be very inconsistent with the rest too often, it can be presumed malicious and punished. There are many different kinds of oracles, and the type that is implemented will depend on what the network and its users need.</p><h2><strong>How to Write a Smart Contract</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>To write a smart contract, you will need to be familiar with at least one programming language used for this purpose. On the Ethereum blockchain, you have the choice of two developer-friendly languages: Solidity and Vyper. You will also need gas: the more complex a transaction in the smart contract, the more gas it will need. Each transaction specifies the amount of gas it is willing to pay to run some code, so the total fee paid comes up to the total gas used times the gas price.</p><p>How to write a smart contract will depend mostly on what you want it to do. The simpler it is, the quicker you can do it, even if your programming knowledge is pretty basic. There are myriads of tutorials online to help you get started.</p><p>The contract will have to be compiled before it’s deployed on the blockchain. Compiling will also help figure out if you’ve written everything correctly and if it’s working the way it should.</p><p>To learn more, you can refer to the Ethereum website, which holds many step-by-step explanations of how their smart contracts work!</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As this guide shows, smart contracts are a way to automate things that would otherwise have to be done manually, with all the security, transparency, and immutability always offered by blockchain technology. While they have some drawbacks, smart contracts still solve genuine issues, which means knowing how to use one (and even write one yourself!) can be an invaluable skill. For starters, however, simply understanding how they work is an excellent starting point for the rest.</p><p><i>Have we missed something you wanted to know?
