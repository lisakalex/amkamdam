<p><i>Monday, December 4, 2023</i> &#8211; Wall Street Memes ($WSM) continues to cement its status as one of the biggest memecoins of 2023, as huge ecosystem growth fuelled by the success of new crypto-based Wall Street Memes Casino leaves $WSM poised for a strong performance in 2024.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/">Wall Street Memes</a> has enjoyed substantial success this year, after a gigantic $25 million presale saw $WSM pump +114% following its launch.</p>
<p>Leaping from strength to strength since, the launch of Wall Street Memes Casino in October has driven significant interest from new investors, with the product being already amongst the fastest growing crypto casinos.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the first month of operations, Wall Street Memes Casino saw a whopping <b>18,100 players sign up</b> generating an impressive<b> $1.5 million in gross gaming revenue</b> across 5,000 high-octane games.</p>
<p>With more than <b>78,000 users</b> on the site in November, it appears that this is just the beginning as crypto gambling continues to grow ahead of the 2024 bull run.</p>
<p>And in the latest news, <a href="https://www.wsmcasino.com/en">Wall Street Memes Casino</a> have just announced a partnership deal with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ifltv">IFLTV</a> &#8211; connecting $WSM with a dedicated new audience of boxing fans around the world.</p>
<p>While details are currently sparse, this partnership is said to focus on special collaborations, giveaways and exclusive bonuses, alongside boosted odds for highly anticipated fights.</p>
<h2><b>Success of Wall Street Memes Casino Fuels Strong Performance For $WSM As Memecoin Markets Hint At ‘Blue Chip’ Status </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In recent weeks, Wall Street Memes has continued to cement its status as one of the biggest meme coins of 2023, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wall-street-memes/">out-performing</a> similar big launches such as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harrypotterobamasonic10inu-eth/">HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu</a> (BITCOIN) over the past month. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139110" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711020-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="" width="1018" height="356" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711020-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg 1018w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711020-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-300x105.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711020-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-768x269.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711020-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-150x52.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<p>(Wall Street Memes &#8211; Blue, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu &#8211; Orange)</p>
<p>With strong price performance signaling <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/">Wall Street Memes</a>’ emergence as a market favorite amongst 2023’s new tokens, eagle-eyed traders will have observed the increasingly close correlation between $WSM and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/">Pepe coin </a>($PEPE) price action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139111" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711033-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1.jpg" alt="" width="1018" height="356" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711033-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1.jpg 1018w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711033-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1-300x105.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711033-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1-768x269.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711033-wsm_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1-150x52.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<p>(Wall Street Memes &#8211; Blue, Pepecoin &#8211; Orange).</p>
<p>This suggests that Wall Street Memes could unlock blue-chip status; remaining a significant player in the highly competitive meme coin vertical due to its impressive ecosystem development and growth potential.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/WSMUSDT/">$WSM price chart</a>, Wall Street Memes is currently attempting to push-up out of a well-defended consolidation in the demand zone around $0.02.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139112" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711055-wsmusdt_2023-12-04_14-47-25.png" alt="" width="1634" height="891" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711055-wsmusdt_2023-12-04_14-47-25.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711055-wsmusdt_2023-12-04_14-47-25-300x164.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711055-wsmusdt_2023-12-04_14-47-25-1024x558.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711055-wsmusdt_2023-12-04_14-47-25-768x419.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711055-wsmusdt_2023-12-04_14-47-25-1536x838.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701711055-wsmusdt_2023-12-04_14-47-25-150x82.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Now above the 20DMA, $WSM’s technical structure is improving, and a neutral RSI reveals the significant upside potential available as $WSM takes aim at a local supply zone around $0.035.</p>
<p>This is backed up with further confirmation from the MACD indicator, which has flipped to minor bullish divergence at 0.00069.</p>
<h2><b>Wall Street Memes Development Team Bolsters $WSM Token Buyback Program</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In another promising development for the <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/">Wall Street Memes ecosystem</a>, the development team has committed to a minimum of 10% of Net Gaming Revenue going towards the token buy-back program.</p>
<p>The $WSM buy-back program was <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes/status/1710282842318463214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1710282842318463214%7Ctwgr%5E4df9dcd75760b200c5f589b1844529c1a933066c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cryptotimes.io%2Fwall-street-memes-announces-1m-token-buyback%2F">launched back in October</a>, and has already seen a huge <b>72M $WSM tokens bought back</b> &#8211; worth around $1.7M at today’s token price.</p>
<p>To celebrate the success of the first month&#8217;s success, the Wall Street Memes team has committed to an additional $100k a day over the next three days. </p>
<p>The buybacks started at 3PM and take place every hour at about $4k (1.84 eth) per buy back.</p>
<p>These buy-back purchases <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x36769ba9b5be044c7aee8d8cace9b662df394ced#tokentxns">can be tracked in a reward wallet</a> established by the team.</p>
<p>While at present these tokens will not be burned, they will be redistributed as community rewards through airdrop campaigns, casino rewards, or adding to the $WSM staking pool.</p>
<h2><b>Wall Street Memes Casino Growth Fuelled By Alluring Buy-Back and Affiliate Programs</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
But that’s not all, with the <a href="https://www.wsmcasino.com/en">WSM Casino’s sign-up bonus</a> still redeemable, new players continue to flock to the massive 200% sign-up bonus up to $25,000.</p>
<p>With the full integration of the platform&#8217;s native $WSM token, players making first-time $WSM deposits can still receive 200 free spins on the most popular slot game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstmemes.com/">$WSM tokenomics</a> therefore sit right at the very heart of the Casino, with a special tier established in the gamification platform offering double rewards for wagering with $WSM.</p>
<p>Yet, this forms just one part of Wall Street Meme’s Casino loyalty program, which also includes <a href="http://wsmaffiliates.com">an exciting affiliate program</a> enabling anyone to secure a 40% slice of net gaming revenue generated by qualified traffic referred to WSM Casino.</p>
<p>All of these programs have fuelled the explosive growth of Wall Street Memes Casino to 18,100 players in its first month.</p>
<p>Plus, with rewards distributed to active players on the casino platform via a number of daily, weekly and seasonal missions and campaigns &#8211; plans are already in the works to boost user retention.</p>

<p>Heading into 2024, <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/">Wall Street Memes</a> has a lot of ambitious plans ahead on the horizon, with analysts highlighting the long-time frame growth potential in the next bull run.</p>
<p>Most recently, Wall Street Memes launched the first bespoke exclusive game on the <a href="https://www.wsmcasino.com/en">WSM Casino</a> &#8211; Bull Run Smash.</p>
<p>This high-speed platform game has already seen a frenzied 36,000 gamers wager on their games.</p>
<p>But nothing has got the Wall Street Memes community more excited in the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes">community Telegram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes">X (Twitter)</a> than the upcoming launch of the WSM Web3 roadmap.</p>
<p>While specific details are yet to be released, it has been confirmed that the first thing to launch will be a new casino revenue dashboard &#8211; enabling holders to track the performance of the ecosystem’s product through transparent real time data including Net Gaming Revenue, buy-backs and rewards.</p>
<p>Other rumored plans include the launch of an airdrop and leaderboards campaign which will </p>
<p>seek to revamp participation and engagement in community events on the casino platform.</p>
<p>Excitement around these expected developments has fuelled<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-wall-street-memes.htm"> renewed interest in Wall Street Memes</a>, with leading YouTube crypto analyst Jacob Crypto Bury<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIgnqb_xuoY"> releasing a bullish 2024 price prediction</a>.</p>

<p>This comes after the ascendant 20DMA triggered a TAO price bounce, which moved +47% in 4-days from double-bottomed support at $230, mounting a new all-time high at $361.</p>
<p>But despite the onset of retracement, a strong support zone has appeared at $307.5, offering a localized foothold for TAO bulls to consolidate after the seismic pump.</p>

<p>If bulls are able to hold position here, TAO price will soon be primed for another push up above $350, however, with the 20DMA lagging behind at $255 its likely this will take some time.</p>
<p>The RSI confirms this consolidatory outlook, with the surge in TAO price propelling the indicator back into serious bearish divergence at an overbought 71.5.</p>
<p>But, this is contrasted aggressively by the MACD, which is spotlighting TAO&#8217;s explosive volatility at 2.98 &#8211; in a sign of serious bullish momentum.</p>
<p>Overall, TAO price looks strong here, with the minor localized retracement healthy after claiming a new all-time high, and with a supportive foothold established upside could resume in coming days.</p>

<p>TAO price is therefore left with an upside target at the all-time high of $361 (a possible +10.6%).</p>
<p>While downside risk could see TAO price fall down to $286.4 (a potential -12.25%).</p>
<p>Bittensor consequently carries an ongoing risk: reward ratio of 0.78 &#8211; a bad entry characterised by a late arrival to the pump, suggesting on the short-time frame it is too late to buy.</p>
<p>But while TAO price offers an unappealing entry on the short-time frame, an emerging meme coin presale is capturing the attention of eagle-eyed investors.</p>

<p>Despite a strong month by the new modular blockchain Celestia, TIA token price has tumbled -5% in pull back from resistance, but could this TIA alternative play offer better returns?</p>
<p>This comes following the announcement that the TIA blockchain will integrate a layer-2 solution known as the &#8216;<a href="https://docs.celestia.org/developers/ethereum-fallback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum fallback mechanism</a>&#8216;, which is aiming to boost data security by using Ethereum as a backup in case of Celestia mainnet downtime &#8211; using both OP stack and Arbitrum.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Prominent trader Crypto Mamba has identified the source of TIA&#8217;s rejection as resistance stemming from the golden ratio &#8211; a common strategy used to trade breakout tokens with little price history.</p>
<h2><strong>TIA Price Analysis: As Celestia Battles Upside Resistance &#8211; Is Celestia Going to Zero?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price action battles for localized support follow the sudden retracement, Celestia is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TIAUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $8.82</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +2.84%).</p>
<p>This comes after TIA price <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-celestia-going-to-zero-tia-price-suffers-6-fall-as-new-bitcoin-mining-project-takes-all-the-limelight-how-does-it-work.htm">met rejection</a> around upside resistance at $9.85 &#8211; in the middle of the 1.618 golden ratio zone &#8211; and just below the psychological resistance level at $10.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138928" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693130-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_11-56-22.png" alt="" width="1634" height="891" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693130-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_11-56-22.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693130-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_11-56-22-300x164.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693130-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_11-56-22-1024x558.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693130-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_11-56-22-768x419.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693130-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_11-56-22-1536x838.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693130-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_11-56-22-150x82.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>However, despite a highly volatile retracement move, which saw price drop down to briefly test lower support around the LTF moving average at $8, TIA price is now fighting to stabilize at STF moving average support around $9.</p>
<p>A successful consolidation here could set the stage for a return back to higher support at $9.25, a level which poises price action for a second retest of resistance at $10.</p>
<p>Indeed, this sentiment is matched by the RSI, which has cooled off significantly to 48.16 amid the retracement move, this suggests price action is now ready to push up (oversold).</p>
<p>Yet, while the RSI is bullish, the MACD contrasts this, flagging bearish divergence at -0.045 (suggesting slowing rally momentum &#8211; which can be seen as price fleets the upper trading channel.</p>
<p>Overall, TIA price looks healthy in structure &#8211; but perhaps over-extended here, with $10 forming a tough resistance level due to both psychological pricing and the golden ratio.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138931" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693148-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_12-28-39.png" alt="" width="1634" height="891" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693148-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_12-28-39.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693148-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_12-28-39-300x164.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693148-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_12-28-39-1024x558.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693148-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_12-28-39-768x419.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693148-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_12-28-39-1536x838.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701693148-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-12-04_12-28-39-150x82.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>This leaves TIA with a short-time frame target at $9.22 (a possible +4.17%).</p>
<p>While downside risk form here could see TIA price plummet down to $8.5 (a potential -3.97%).</p>
<p>TIA price therefore currently carries a risk: reward structure of 1.05, this suggests that while profitable &#8211; there is meagre returns in TIA&#8217;s short-time frame movements.</p>
<p>Yet, while TIA might not offer substantial returns now, an emerging Bitcoin-linked presale is capturing the attention of eagle-eyed traders &#8211; here&#8217;s why.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Smashes $4.7M Raised as Traders Rally Against Bitcoin Mining Centralization</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the 2021 Bull Run, Bitcoin mining has defied expectations by undertaking something of a renaissance in network growth.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate">Hash Rate</a> (a measure of the total amount of computational power directed at mining Bitcoin blocks) has surged to an incredible all-time high of 456.6 Exahashes per second (EH/S).</p>

<p>This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results">reported that for Q3 2023</a> it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/">a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s</a> (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024.</p>
<p>But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.</p>
<p>A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">55.79%</a> of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.</p>
<p>AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).</p>
<p>This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.</p>

<p>This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>This challenge of heightened network difficulty, fuelled by increased competition and centralization of mining power, has created the need for new solutions for the retail investor to participate in Bitcoin mining – both for network decentralization and preserving Bitcoin as a profitable activity for the individual.</p>
<p>Enter Bitcoin Minetrix, which was launched to deliver secure and transparent Bitcoin mining rewards for the retail investor through an innovative, decentralized Bitcoin cloud mining approach.</p>

<h2><strong>BabyGROK Price Analysis: After New BabyGROK Token Explodes +1,000% &#8211; Is BabyGROK Doomed to Dump?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Amid the ongoing retracement move, BabyGROK token is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x15cce25f30034851869d61ac295593a92d0c63c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.07617</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +253%).</p>
<p>This comes after the token&#8217;s sudden stealth launch at 5:45AM on December 3, which saw the BabyGROK token start life with slow initial traction.</p>
<p>Indeed, BabyGROK saw only modest +26% traction in the first 6-hours of trading, however, at 11AM a huge influx of more than $277k in trading volume flooded into the chart.</p>
<p>Rally movements took hold, and price shot up an eye-watering +874% in less than 2-hours, with 830 holders taking position in the big gainer.</p>

<p>In the next 12 hours, price action saw considerable consolidatory form, with price gently pushing up to an all-time high at $0.22 by 10PM.</p>
<p>However, despite the impressive 24-hour push to a respectable $761k market cap, BabyGROK token has now entered retracement with price plummeting -65% this morning.</p>
<p>This still leaves early backers sat atop +293% gains, however, with the downside move stood on its last legs at lower support around $0.075 &#8211; BabyGROK appears vulnerable to a capitulative dump here.</p>
<p>Despite the difficult chart position, buy pressure remains strong &#8211; currently representing 74% of transactions, this suggests price could find more upside soon.</p>
<p>Indeed, if BabyGROK token is able to replicate the success of similar BabyPEPE token (which hit a $20m market cap) then there could be as much as a 25x left on the table here.</p>
<p>But with BabyGROK price action reeling and support waning following the huge move, smart money investors are shifting their focus to finding alternative skyrocket-potential gems early to secure the biggest gains.</p>
<p>One such opportunity is a surging crypto presale for a new token that could explode as market excitement around Bitcoin Spot ETFs grows.</p>

<p>A new Bitcoin alternative presale launched this week, offering eagle-eyed traders the opportunity to make it big on unfolding Bitcoin ETF rumors without having to eat the $37,000 cost of becoming a whole-coiner.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is currently listed at a market price of $0.0062, with an alluring $2,445,237 raised in the opening weeks of the presale.</p>
<p>Designed and built with skyrocket potential in mind, this promising token aims to bank big on market excitement surrounding the ongoing applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>
<p>Aiming for a hard cap of $5m in presale funding, the early stage of this emerging project’s presale offers investors a unique opportunity to get in during this early entry point, which could set the stage for life-changing gains.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bitcoin ETF isn’t simply a useless meme coin, beyond taking aim at the biggest narrative in crypto – BTCETF has a major utility: Bitcoin ETF news alerts.</p>
<p>The token’s dApp offers traders a live feed of the latest Bitcoin spot ETF information and news, with sophisticated technology tracking applications real-time at the SEC, and high-speed bots monitoring social media for the latest breaking ETF news.</p>
<p>But a simple feed of Bitcoin Spot ETF news only highlights a fraction of Bitcoin ETF token’s potential, with easy-access to real-time update alerts offering sharp traders the opportunity to make market-beating returns stress-free; being amongst the first to hear about privileged Bitcoin Spot ETF news.</p>
<p>This could enable traders to position themselves appropriately in seismic Bitcoin market movements, making Bitcoin ETF token a critical component in every BTC trader’s tool-box this Winter.</p>
<h2><strong>Surging Interest in Bitcoin Alternatives Leaves $BTCETF Poised to Outperform $BABYGROK Token</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<iframe title="BTC ETF Token Raises $2,000,000 (Best Crypto to Buy Now?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5U1QMqQ5_2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Project tokenomics are bolstered by ambitious plans for the incorporation of staking rewards that incentivize long-term holding, alongside a burn mechanism, which will enhance $BTCETF as a ‘digital gold’ alternative, by creating a deflationary mechanism in price.</p>
<p>Set for stage 3 of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF project roadmap</a>, an initial burn mechanism will be introduced amid a well-marketed DEX launch, imposing an initial 5% burn tax on transactions – this will be reduced by -1% each time a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is reached.</p>
<p>However, plans are afoot for a larger burn mechanism in stage 4, in a move that will see 25% of token supply burned overtime, this will be conducted in 5% burn intervals – with each supply-side reduction taking place as a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is met.</p>
<p>The milestones for the burn mechanism are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 – <strong>$BTCETF Trading Volume hits $100m</strong> – burn tax on transactions reduced from<strong> 5% to 4%</strong>, and 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 2 – <strong>First Bitcoin ETF is approved by SEC</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>4% to 3%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 3- <strong>First Bitcoin ETF launch date</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>3% to 2%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 4 – <strong>Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) hits $1bn</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>2% to 1%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 5 – <strong>Bitcoin price hits $100k</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>1% to 0%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create a gradual decrease in total supply, eventually leaving around 70% of BTCETF in circulation, with the supply-side reduction inducing upside price growth.</p>
<p>And that is without considering the potential for token value accrual driven by demand from traders for access to the ETF news dApp and the ever-present demand for Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2023 has seen explosive growth in Bitcoin-related tokens – with markets showing a real appetite for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-network-in-flux-as-brc-20-craze-sends-transaction-fees-towards-multi-year-highs-what-next-for-btc-price.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRC-20 ordinal tokens</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-finds-feet-above-34k-while-bitcoin-minetrix-hits-3m.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cloud Mining</a>, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65043a584bebee279199cd55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin derivatives</a>.</p>

<p>With the AI crypto narrative back on the menu, market appetite for AI tokens is growing insatiable, and Bittensor has emerged as a favorite after TAO price spiked +17%.</p>
<p>The pump comes in the midst of a return to bullish Spring market sentiment, with the rising time of the AI narrative once again sweeping through charts, in a move reminiscent of major pumps for <a href="https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/fetch-ai-price-prediction-up-26-to-0-43-in-7-days-is-it-the-best-ai-crypto-02656323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FET</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-today-22-february-fght-1inch-metro-agix-cchg.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGIX</a>.</p>

<p>Traders are turning hyper bullish on the huge breakout rally, with some even suggesting TAO could climb as high as $1000 from here, yet, with TAO token now <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-bittensor-tao-price-soars-100-with-the-rise-of-an-exclusive-telegram-crypto-casino-how-to-play.htm">pushing into the three figure price range</a>, could a healthy retracement move be on its way?</p>
<h2><strong>TAO Price Analysis: Is It Too Late to Buy Bittensor As +17% Spike Fuels New All-Time High?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As Bittensor battles to solidify support following a new all-time high for the second time in two weeks, TAO is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TAOUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $282</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -2.36%).</p>
<p>This comes as double-bottomed structure emerges following two rejections from resistance at $307, providing bullish posture to the TAO price breakout to a new all-time high at $310.</p>
<p>With a higher high established on the chart, and a lower low emerging from an extremely well-defended localized retracement, TAO price appears poised to shift into price exploration as the breakout trading channel stands strong.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138457" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443432-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-02-05.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443432-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-02-05.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443432-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-02-05-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443432-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-02-05-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443432-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-02-05-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443432-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-02-05-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>In addition to the impressive technical structure, TAO price action continues to find reassurance from the ascendant support of the 20DMA, which is currently standing at $228 &#8211; bolstering a localized lower support level at $230.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 200DMA (sat at $79) remains gradually ascendant; reflecting the growing momentum as the Bittensor breakout snowballs.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the double-bottomed retracement, the RSI has struggled to cool off significantly, with the leading indicator reading at 69 &#8211; a bearish signal suggesting price structure is overbought.</p>
<p>Worryingly, this also achieves confirmation from the MACD indicator, which is reading at -0.36 in a sign of minor bearish divergence in TAO price momentum.</p>
<p>Overall, TAO price appears technically strong here, with a well-defended double-bottomed consolidation likely to see price attempt to push higher &#8211; but traders should exercise caution as key indicators reveal that TAO price could be over-extended.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138458" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443449-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-03-30.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443449-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-03-30.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443449-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-03-30-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443449-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-03-30-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443449-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-03-30-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701443449-thumbnail_taousdt_2023-12-01_15-03-30-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>On the short-time frame TAO has an upside target at the all-time high around $310 (a possible +9.15%).</p>
<p>While downside risk poses an immediate threat of a retreat down to $230 (a potential -19%).</p>
<p>Therefore TAO price is left with a challenging risk: reward structure of 0.48, suggesting now could be too late to buy Bittensor on the short-time frame.</p>
<p>But while TAO price might not offer immediate opportunities for big returns, a rapidly growing Telegram-based crypto casino is exploding in presale as market sentiments shifts bullish on this Rollbit alternative.</p>

<p>The presale is where things get even more intriguing as the offered staking APY is nothing short of spectacular, standing proudly at 182%.</p>
<p>Given that over a million tokens have been staked within a day of the presale launch, the momentum is palpable.</p>
<p>And a well-conceived buyback mechanism ensures price stability and regular rewards, a win-win for the community.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino">$TGC token’s utility</a> is another aspect to spotlight – beyond its primary function in the casino world, its adaptability – be it swapped for gaming credits or other cryptos – adds layers to its potential growth.</p>
<p>Its role in transactions, from deposits to withdrawals, signifies its pivotal role in the TG.Casino framework.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Buy TG Casino Early?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Go over to their official website</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you want to get correctly is going over to their<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino"> official website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 – Create a Crypto Wallet</strong></p>
<p>You need to set up a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">crypto wallet</a>, and it’s important to chose a wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens as this is TGC Standards.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 – Purchase ETH or USDT</strong></p>
<p>Next is to purchase some Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT), as these are the tokens used to exchange into TGC.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 – Connect Wallet to Presale Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TG.Casino’s website</a> and click on the ‘Connect Wallet’ button. A pop-up box will appear, in which investors can choose their wallet provider and link their wallet to the presale dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 – Buy TG.Casino Token</strong></p>
<p>Investors will see an order box on-screen where they can either select ETH or USDT (or buy on BSC) to use for the exchange. Investors also need to decide the amount of $TGC coin you want to buy; the minimum investment is 1,000 $TGC. After making sure that everything is accurate, confirm the trade.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 – Claim TG.Casino Token</strong></p>
<p>Once TG.Casino’s presale has ended, there will be a Token Generation Event (TGE), where investors can claim their purchased tokens by clicking the ‘Claim’ button on TG.Casino’s homepage. That’s all for how to buy TG.Casino.</p>

<p>To wrap it up, TG.Casino ($TGC) presale is not just an opportunity; it’s a front-row ticket to the future of Telegram GambleFi.</p>
<p>With tokenomics supply – fairly distributed across the presale, liquidity pools, staking rewards, and player rewards – and the additional bolster of TG Casino’s jaw-dropping 182% APY – this project is positioned to become a huge name in the GambleFi vertical.</p>
<p>Its blend of a comprehensive ecosystem, enticing financial benefits, and user-centric approach make it a tantalizing prospect. But as always, arm yourself with research, and here’s to successful ventures ahead!</p>

<p>As Chainlink struggles to push up out of consolidation, LINK price is currently up +2.9%, but with market attention shifting to a new mining protocol &#8211; is Chainlink going to zero?</p>
<p>This comes following a sensational breakout move by LINK price<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/it-too-late-buy-chainlink-link-price-rockets-11-as-surprising-new-meme-coin-secures-650000-funding-whats-going-on.htm"> over the past two months</a>, which has seen the leading oracle project smash above 16-months of resistance in strong rally form.</p>

<p>Fuelled in part by a broader market recovery, Chainlink&#8217;s impressive pump has also been sustained due to market excitement about an upcoming Chainlink<a href="https://chain.link/whitepaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2.0 upgrade</a>.</p>

<p>Market sentiment is consequently positive, with prominent traders on crypto Twitter (X) highlighting a bullish shift in LINK&#8217;s consolidation posturing.</p>
<h2><strong>LINK Price Analysis: Is Chainlink Going to Zero as LINK Price Continues to Battle Consolidation?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As LINK fights to push out of the consolidation zone, Chainlink is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LINKUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $14.78</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +2.58%).</p>
<p>This comes as LINK price hammers back above the 20DMA (sat at $14.5) , a key moving average which has provided support to much of recent upside movements, in a critical reclamation that leaves LINK poised to push up higher.</p>
<p>The successful defence of the 20DMA has been triggered by collision with the lower trendline of the localized breakout channel, signalling that market sentiment remains bullish when faced with trendline resistance &#8211; indicating price might move up soon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138382" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436119-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-57-57.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436119-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-57-57.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436119-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-57-57-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436119-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-57-57-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436119-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-57-57-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436119-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-57-57-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>However, there are significant resistance levels over-head with LINK price first targeting a break above $15 ahead of a re-test of the local high at $16.</p>
<p>Yet, conditions seem ripe, with the RSI indicator cooling down substantially amid the -22% retracement move across November, now signalling at 58.24 &#8211; a relatively neutral signal that gives LINK price plenty of capacity to move up.</p>
<p>But the MACD contrasts this, spotlighting weakening momentum, with minor bearish divergence at -0.15.</p>
<p>Overall, LINK price looks increasingly strong here, the well-defended move back above 20DMA support has been critical in avoiding a catastrophic retracement move, and LINK now seems intent on continuing movements within the breakout rally channel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138383" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436135-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-59-24.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436135-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-59-24.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436135-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-59-24-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436135-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-59-24-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436135-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-59-24-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701436135-thumbnail_linkusdt_2023-12-01_12-59-24-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Chainlink&#8217;s short-time frame upside target therefore sits at $15.42 (a potential +4.33%).</p>
<p>While downside risk from here could see LINK price fall down to $12.88 (a potential -12.86%).</p>
<p>Therefore Chainlink carries a current risk: reward ratio of 0.34, a bad entry, characterised by late-stage entry, but certainly <strong>not going to zero</strong> anytime soon.</p>
<p>But while LINK Price currently offers an unattractive risk: reward offering, an emerging mining protocol presale is capturing the attention of markets.</p>

<p>This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results">reported that for Q3 2023</a> it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/">a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s</a> (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024.</p>
<p>But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.</p>
<p>A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">55.79%</a> of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.</p>
<p>AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).</p>
<p>This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.</p>

<p>This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>Taking on the mask of the popular Folk Finance DeFi project&#8217;s XALGO token, this spin-off appears to have been stealth launched with little to no marketing, but based on Raydium blockchain.</p>
<h2><strong>XALGO Price Analysis: Can XALGO Breakout of Long-Standing Descendant Trading Channel?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price stabilizes after the seismic pump, XALGO is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/ANPiE2Bc7DXVndGHW5Z27WkHoTYdniopEeAce54vGgjx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.2175</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +1,169%).</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s huge pump, followed a catastrophic downtick on November 29, which saw XALGO price hammer-down to rock-bottomed support at $0.014 in a dramatic -91% move.</p>
<p>However, against a backdrop of an incredibly low market cap of just $25k &#8211; and even weaker trading volumes, the major dip has been eaten up quickly &#8211; leaving price poised for a re-test of upper trendline resistance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138340" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701431386-xalgo_usd-ray-dextools-io_2023-12-01_11-11-39.png" alt="" width="1478" height="631" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701431386-xalgo_usd-ray-dextools-io_2023-12-01_11-11-39.png 1478w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701431386-xalgo_usd-ray-dextools-io_2023-12-01_11-11-39-300x128.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701431386-xalgo_usd-ray-dextools-io_2023-12-01_11-11-39-1024x437.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701431386-xalgo_usd-ray-dextools-io_2023-12-01_11-11-39-768x328.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1478px) 100vw, 1478px" /></p>
<p>Yet, breaking through resistance here could be easier said than done, with the upper trendline stemming from major historical resistance, which since February 2023 has formed an impenetrable layer for price action.</p>
<p>With XALGO price seemingly trapped under this steeply descendant trading channel hopes remain low, although it is crucial to note that only a small influx of trading volume could set the stage for a huge run.</p>
<p>Indeed, comparable pumps often push up to multi-million market caps, so if XALGO was to post gains up to a $1m market cap that would represent a 40x return from here.</p>
<p>This highlights the allure of this emerging play, and it seems markets are taking notice with buy pressure representing 70% of transactions over the past 24-hours.</p>
<p>But with upper trendline resistance overheard, XALGO also represents a high risk play, and this is driving some in the market to seek out similarly lucrative but safer plays like crypto presales.</p>
<p>One such project making waves is Bitcoin ETF token, which is surging in presale due to market excitement around anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETFs.</p>

<p>A new Bitcoin alternative presale launched this week, offering eagle-eyed traders the opportunity to make it big on unfolding Bitcoin ETF rumors without having to eat the $37,000 cost of becoming a whole-coiner.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is currently listed at a market price of $0.006, with an alluring $2,130,344 raised in the opening weeks of the presale.</p>
<p>Designed and built with skyrocket potential in mind, this promising token aims to bank big on market excitement surrounding the ongoing applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>
<p>Aiming for a hard cap of $5m in presale funding, the early stage of this emerging project’s presale offers investors a unique opportunity to get in during this early entry point, which could set the stage for life-changing gains.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bitcoin ETF isn’t simply a useless meme coin, beyond taking aim at the biggest narrative in crypto – BTCETF has a major utility: Bitcoin ETF news alerts.</p>
<p>The token’s dApp offers traders a live feed of the latest Bitcoin spot ETF information and news, with sophisticated technology tracking applications real-time at the SEC, and high-speed bots monitoring social media for the latest breaking ETF news.</p>
<p>But a simple feed of Bitcoin Spot ETF news only highlights a fraction of Bitcoin ETF token’s potential, with easy-access to real-time update alerts offering sharp traders the opportunity to make market-beating returns stress-free; being amongst the first to hear about privileged Bitcoin Spot ETF news.</p>
<p>This could enable traders to position themselves appropriately in seismic Bitcoin market movements, making Bitcoin ETF token a critical component in every BTC trader’s tool-box this Winter.</p>
<h2><strong>Surging Interest in Bitcoin Alternatives Leaves $BTCETF Poised to Outperform $XALGOToken</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Project tokenomics are bolstered by ambitious plans for the incorporation of staking rewards that incentivize long-term holding, alongside a burn mechanism, which will enhance $BTCETF as a ‘digital gold’ alternative, by creating a deflationary mechanism in price.</p>
<p>Set for stage 3 of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF project roadmap</a>, an initial burn mechanism will be introduced amid a well-marketed DEX launch, imposing an initial 5% burn tax on transactions – this will be reduced by -1% each time a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is reached.</p>
<p>However, plans are afoot for a larger burn mechanism in stage 4, in a move that will see 25% of token supply burned overtime, this will be conducted in 5% burn intervals – with each supply-side reduction taking place as a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is met.</p>
<p>The milestones for the burn mechanism are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 – <strong>$BTCETF Trading Volume hits $100m</strong> – burn tax on transactions reduced from<strong> 5% to 4%</strong>, and 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 2 – <strong>First Bitcoin ETF is approved by SEC</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>4% to 3%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 3- <strong>First Bitcoin ETF launch date</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>3% to 2%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 4 – <strong>Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) hits $1bn</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>2% to 1%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 5 – <strong>Bitcoin price hits $100k</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>1% to 0%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create a gradual decrease in total supply, eventually leaving around 70% of BTCETF in circulation, with the supply-side reduction inducing upside price growth.</p>
<p>And that is without considering the potential for token value accrual driven by demand from traders for access to the ETF news dApp and the ever-present demand for Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2023 has seen explosive growth in Bitcoin-related tokens – with markets showing a real appetite for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-network-in-flux-as-brc-20-craze-sends-transaction-fees-towards-multi-year-highs-what-next-for-btc-price.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRC-20 ordinal tokens</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-finds-feet-above-34k-while-bitcoin-minetrix-hits-3m.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cloud Mining</a>, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65043a584bebee279199cd55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin derivatives</a>.</p>

<p>Leading DAG-based Layer-1 solution IOTA price has exploded +44% after the Iota Foundation launched as a new $100M entity in Abu Dhabi, but with markets caught off-guard, is it too late to buy IOTA?</p>
<p>Despite a tumultuous 2023, which has seen IOTA price struggle to break high in face of capstone moving average resistance, the sensational breakout pump yesterday has left markets in awe.</p>
<p>Excitement stems from the launch of the IOTA Foundation <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/iota-rolls-out-100m-abu-dhabi-foundation-targets-middle-east.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entity in the UAE</a>, an initiative which has the stated aim of helping to convert real world assets into digital ones.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The $100M investment, funded by IOTA token seeding, comes as a vote of confidence after IOTA became the first blockchain company to be approved by regulators on the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) after the finalization of crypto regulations earlier this month.</p>
<h2><strong>IOTA Price Analysis: Is It Too Late to Buy IOTA After $100M Foundation Launch in Abu Dhabi?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price action reels from yesterday&#8217;s explosive pump, IOTA is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/IOTAUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.22</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -11.67%).</p>
<p>The -22% retracement move comes after the +44% IOTA price pump was stalled by long-time frame upper trendline resistance &#8211; posting a local top at $0.29.</p>
<p>Catalysed by the IOTA Foundation news, the magnificent upside move coincided with a bounce off the 200DMA (currently stood at $0.17).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138068" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355358-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-06.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355358-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-06.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355358-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-06-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355358-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-06-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355358-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-06-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355358-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-06-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Bullish posturing has been in the works for weeks now, with the 20DMA (current at $0.18) forming a golden cross over the 200DMA on November 13.</p>
<p>Now fighting to consolidate new-found explosive gains, IOTA price is currently seeking to find a local support &#8211; although there are few historical footholds in the ongoing range.</p>
<p>This exposes IOTA price to downside risk, and this sentiment is backed by the RSI which signals bearish at 62.86 &#8211; signalling further potential for retracement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the MACD remains marginally bullish at 0.0042, suggesting bullish momentum remains after the announcement.</p>
<p>Overall, IOTA seems bold but vulnerable here, the explosive move up shows substantial market appetite, but a lack of localized support for a period of consolidation could create problems.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138069" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355373-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-35.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355373-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-35.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355373-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-35-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355373-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-35-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355373-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-35-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701355373-thumbnail_iotausdt_2023-11-30_14-40-35-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>IOTA price is therefore left scrambling for a higher support level at $0.25 (a potential +11.26%).</p>
<p>While further downside could see IOTA price risk a drop to $0.197 (a possible -12.33%).</p>
<p>Risk: reward for IOTA price consequently stands at 0.91, a bad entry at the volatile tail end of a breakout rally, suggesting <strong>too late to buy</strong> on the short-time frame.</p>
<p>But while IOTA offers a poor entry at this point, another opportunity emerges in a new GambleFi presale that is skyrocketing on the promise of replicating Rollbit&#8217;s success.</p>

<p>The presale is where things get even more intriguing as the offered staking APY is nothing short of spectacular, standing proudly at 191%.</p>
<p>Given that over a million tokens have been staked within a day of the presale launch, the momentum is palpable.</p>
<p>And a well-conceived buyback mechanism ensures price stability and regular rewards, a win-win for the community.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino">$TGC token’s utility</a> is another aspect to spotlight – beyond its primary function in the casino world, its adaptability – be it swapped for gaming credits or other cryptos – adds layers to its potential growth.</p>
<p>Its role in transactions, from deposits to withdrawals, signifies its pivotal role in the TG.Casino framework.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Buy TG Casino Early?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Go over to their official website</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you want to get correctly is going over to their<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino"> official website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 – Create a Crypto Wallet</strong></p>
<p>You need to set up a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">crypto wallet</a>, and it’s important to chose a wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens as this is TGC Standards.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 – Purchase ETH or USDT</strong></p>
<p>Next is to purchase some Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT), as these are the tokens used to exchange into TGC.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 – Connect Wallet to Presale Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TG.Casino’s website</a> and click on the ‘Connect Wallet’ button. A pop-up box will appear, in which investors can choose their wallet provider and link their wallet to the presale dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 – Buy TG.Casino Token</strong></p>
<p>Investors will see an order box on-screen where they can either select ETH or USDT (or buy on BSC) to use for the exchange. Investors also need to decide the amount of $TGC coin you want to buy; the minimum investment is 1,000 $TGC. After making sure that everything is accurate, confirm the trade.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 – Claim TG.Casino Token</strong></p>
<p>Once TG.Casino’s presale has ended, there will be a Token Generation Event (TGE), where investors can claim their purchased tokens by clicking the ‘Claim’ button on TG.Casino’s homepage. That’s all for how to buy TG.Casino.</p>

<p>As price action continues to consolidate after the seismic launch of the Pyth Network airdrop, traders are on edge with a -11% PYTH price drop threatening technical structure, leading some panicked holders to ask &#8216;is Pyth Network Going to Zero?&#8217;.</p>
<p>Market interest in airdrops is at an all time high following the spectacular performance of modular layer-1 blockchain Celestia (TIA) – which has <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celestia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploded +117%</a> since launching earlier in Q3.</p>
<p>However, the Pyth airdrop has been hot on its heels, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-pyth-network-pyth-price-erupts-53-after-airdrop-and-this-might-be-the-next-crypto-to-explode.htm">PYTH exploding +584%</a> following an initial sell-off when the airdrop tokens were distributed to holders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137955" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345544-tia_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1.jpg" alt="" width="1018" height="356" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345544-tia_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1.jpg 1018w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345544-tia_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1-300x105.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701345544-tia_1m_graph_coinmarketcap-1-768x269.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<p>PYTH&#8217;s recent returns (in orange) currently outperform the steady growth of TIA (in blue), and amid decreasing trading volume &#8211; traders are identifying an emerging double-bottomed support pattern bolstering market sentiment.</p>

<h2><strong>PYTH Price Analysis: Could Double-Bottomed Support Poise Pyth Network For a Second Rally Leg? Or is Pyth Going to Zero?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As PYTH price once again pushes up, Pyth Networking is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/PYTHUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.41</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +2.44%).</p>
<p>This comes following a panicked drop below moving average support, which saw PYTH price tumble -11% in a retest of lower support around $0.40.</p>
<p>The downtick saw a well-defended display by Pyth airdrop holders, and created the opportunity for a double-bottomed support pattern on the chart.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137960" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346767-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_11-54-18.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346767-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_11-54-18.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346767-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_11-54-18-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346767-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_11-54-18-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346767-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_11-54-18-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346767-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_11-54-18-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Subsequently, PYTH price has flipped bullish with strong technical structure suggesting upside movements are on the horizon.</p>
<p>Yet, there is a lot of overhead risk, with a significant layer of resistance at $0.45 threatening to cripple any attempt at a major pump.</p>
<p>In the midst of this strengthening structure, the RSI remains loosely on the fence at 51.60, this suggests price has plenty of capacity to push higher if a rally ignites.</p>
<p>And this bullish sentiment is mirrored by the MACD, which has minor divergence at 0.0018.</p>
<p>Overall, PYTH price appears healthy here, with technical structure and indicators leaning towards a run at upper resistance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137962" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346968-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_12-16-56.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346968-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_12-16-56.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346968-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_12-16-56-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346968-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_12-16-56-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346968-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_12-16-56-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701346968-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-30_12-16-56-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>This leaves PYTH price with an upside target at $0.45 (a potential +10.62%).</p>
<p>While downside risk could see PYTH price fall to $0.37 (a possible -9.05%).</p>
<p>Pyth Network, therefore carries a short-time frame risk: reward ratio of 1.17, a moderately alluring entry but with little meat on the bone for hungry traders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, smart money investors are shifting their focus to rapidly growing presales, which could offer more attractive returns due to early-backer entries, and amongst the most promising presales of November 2023 is Bitcoin Minetrix.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Smashes $4.5M Raised as Traders Rally Against Bitcoin Mining Centralization</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the 2021 Bull Run, Bitcoin mining has defied expectations by undertaking something of a renaissance in network growth.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate">Hash Rate</a> (a measure of the total amount of computational power directed at mining Bitcoin blocks) has surged to an incredible all-time high of 456.6 Exahashes per second (EH/S).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137965" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701347145-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701347145-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701347145-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701347145-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701347145-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results">reported that for Q3 2023</a> it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/">a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s</a> (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024.</p>
<p>But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.</p>
<p>A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">55.79%</a> of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.</p>
<p>AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).</p>
<p>This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.</p>

<p>This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>This challenge of heightened network difficulty, fuelled by increased competition and centralization of mining power, has created the need for new solutions for the retail investor to participate in Bitcoin mining – both for network decentralization and preserving Bitcoin as a profitable activity for the individual.</p>
<p>Enter Bitcoin Minetrix, which was launched to deliver secure and transparent Bitcoin mining rewards for the retail investor through an innovative, decentralized Bitcoin cloud mining approach.</p>
<h2><strong>Key Highlights of the BTCMTX Advantage Over PYTH Price Retracement:</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

<h2><strong>XCEPT Price Analysis: Can New Trading Bot Project Maintain Skyrocketing Performance After +8,500% Rally?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As XCEPT forms a support zone following the sensational pump, XCEPT is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x5b3be30117e71ed1fea9485abb6b4c11c71c0d6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.001763</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +8,298%).</p>
<p>Launched at just 14:00 on November 29, XCEPT token saw a magnificent open, with a small amount of social media marketing fuelling a whopping +7,900% move out the gate &#8211; amid a significant inflow of $750k in trading volume.</p>
<p>This saw price hammer up to establish an initial support zone around $0.002125, and with well-defended form over two-hours, the stage was set for a further +33% pump, which pushed price up to an all-time high at $0.003 at 17:00.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137919" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701340676-xcept_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-30_10-35-11.png" alt="" width="1409" height="625" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701340676-xcept_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-30_10-35-11.png 1409w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701340676-xcept_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-30_10-35-11-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701340676-xcept_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-30_10-35-11-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701340676-xcept_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-30_10-35-11-768x341.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1409px) 100vw, 1409px" /></p>
<p>However, with price over-extended after delivering a huge +8,500% rally in the first 4-hours of trading, XCEPT entered a retracement move that would ultimately see the token bleed-out -42% over the subsequent of -42%.</p>
<p>Yet, strong support at $0.0017 appears to have established a floor, which has given rise to an emerging double-bottomed support move &#8211; within a bullish pendant pattern.</p>
<p>With the stage set for another upside move, all eyes are on the 55% buy pressure in transactions over the past 6-hours for signs of a capital influx.</p>
<p>Indeed, with a lowly market cap of just $1.75m, XCEPT could still see substantial upside moves, with similar bot projects flying to $5m market caps &#8211; this suggests as much as a 4x return from current levels.</p>
<p>But while traders, weigh up a late-entry into the XCEPT pump, a safer alternative is emerging in the BTC ETF presale, which just hit $2M as traders flock to the ETF beta play.</p>

<p>A new Bitcoin alternative presale launched this week, offering eagle-eyed traders the opportunity to make it big on unfolding Bitcoin ETF rumors without having to eat the $37,000 cost of becoming a whole-coiner.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is currently listed at a market price of $0.006, with an alluring $2,044,113 raised in the opening weeks of the presale.</p>
<p>Designed and built with skyrocket potential in mind, this promising token aims to bank big on market excitement surrounding the ongoing applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>
<p>Aiming for a hard cap of $5m in presale funding, the early stage of this emerging project’s presale offers investors a unique opportunity to get in during this early entry point, which could set the stage for life-changing gains.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bitcoin ETF isn’t simply a useless meme coin, beyond taking aim at the biggest narrative in crypto – BTCETF has a major utility: Bitcoin ETF news alerts.</p>
<p>The token’s dApp offers traders a live feed of the latest Bitcoin spot ETF information and news, with sophisticated technology tracking applications real-time at the SEC, and high-speed bots monitoring social media for the latest breaking ETF news.</p>
<p>But a simple feed of Bitcoin Spot ETF news only highlights a fraction of Bitcoin ETF token’s potential, with easy-access to real-time update alerts offering sharp traders the opportunity to make market-beating returns stress-free; being amongst the first to hear about privileged Bitcoin Spot ETF news.</p>
<p>This could enable traders to position themselves appropriately in seismic Bitcoin market movements, making Bitcoin ETF token a critical component in every BTC trader’s tool-box this Winter.</p>
<h2><strong>Surging Interest in Bitcoin Alternatives Leaves $BTCETF Poised to Outperform $FROGE Token</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Project tokenomics are bolstered by ambitious plans for the incorporation of staking rewards that incentivize long-term holding, alongside a burn mechanism, which will enhance $BTCETF as a ‘digital gold’ alternative, by creating a deflationary mechanism in price.</p>
<p>Set for stage 3 of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF project roadmap</a>, an initial burn mechanism will be introduced amid a well-marketed DEX launch, imposing an initial 5% burn tax on transactions – this will be reduced by -1% each time a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is reached.</p>
<p>However, plans are afoot for a larger burn mechanism in stage 4, in a move that will see 25% of token supply burned overtime, this will be conducted in 5% burn intervals – with each supply-side reduction taking place as a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is met.</p>
<p>The milestones for the burn mechanism are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 – <strong>$BTCETF Trading Volume hits $100m</strong> – burn tax on transactions reduced from<strong> 5% to 4%</strong>, and 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 2 – <strong>First Bitcoin ETF is approved by SEC</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>4% to 3%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 3- <strong>First Bitcoin ETF launch date</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>3% to 2%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 4 – <strong>Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) hits $1bn</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>2% to 1%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 5 – <strong>Bitcoin price hits $100k</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>1% to 0%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create a gradual decrease in total supply, eventually leaving around 70% of BTCETF in circulation, with the supply-side reduction inducing upside price growth.</p>
<p>And that is without considering the potential for token value accrual driven by demand from traders for access to the ETF news dApp and the ever-present demand for Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2023 has seen explosive growth in Bitcoin-related tokens – with markets showing a real appetite for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-network-in-flux-as-brc-20-craze-sends-transaction-fees-towards-multi-year-highs-what-next-for-btc-price.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRC-20 ordinal tokens</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-finds-feet-above-34k-while-bitcoin-minetrix-hits-3m.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cloud Mining</a>, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65043a584bebee279199cd55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin derivatives</a>.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, November 29, 2023</i> &#8211; November’s breakout DEX token $ETHETF is rapidly approaching the 21% of total supply burn target, with 1,000,000 tokens burned today alone, as markets flip bullish &#8211; don’t miss out.</p>
<p><a href="https://ethetftoken.io/">ETH ETF token</a> is making waves in DEX markets once again, as another 1,000,000 $ETHETF tokens are burned (representing 1% of total supply). The burn <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x42ab50c300444ea69078e0b05af2e9bdbefc690b2b926d26f66a500fe81bcf42">can be tracked on Etherscan here</a>.</p>

<p>This burn is the latest in the midst of an ongoing dynamic burn mechanism, aiming to reduce ETH ETF token supply by 21M tokens (or around 21% of supply).</p>
<p>With the number of manually burned ETHETF tokens now standing at 14,000,000, atop a further 6,000,000 burned via the 2% buy tax, a total of 20,000,000 $ETHETF (valued at over $200k) has been <a href="https://etherscan.io/advanced-filter?tkn=0x91be752d438d5F804345b5AcB18DE0c431aD470F&amp;txntype=2&amp;mtd=0x42966c68%7eBurn">removed from the total supply</a> (equating to a 20% reduction).</p>

<h2><b>ETH ETF’s Big Burn Event: How Does The $ETHETF Burn Mechanism Work?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following a sensational stealth launch, which saw $ETHETF skyrocket +218% in the first 48-hours of trading, ETH ETF token <a href="https://twitter.com/ETHETFToken/status/1725145844729680022">announced </a>the introduction of a token burn program on November 16.</p>
<p>The burn mechanism had the stated goal of reducing token supply by 21% (a tip of the hat to Bitcoin’s 21M supply).</p>
<p>Burn mechanisms work by sending tokens to a null address on the blockchain that has nothing but a receive function, eliminating the tokens from circulating supply.</p>
<p>This induces a deflationary effect on the tokenomics, with a supply-side reduction resulting in significant price accrual.</p>
<h2><b>$ETHETF Price Analysis: Is ETHETF Token Poised For Recovery Rally After Burn Milestone?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following localized retracement in the aftermath of a skyrocket launch, $ETHETF is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd109c5d4a0b0557f4418574180780d52cd0793fd">market price of $0.01030</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -5.89%).</p>
<p>Upside momentum has resumed over the past week, with price action seeing $ETHETF cement a +27% gain after support was established at $0.008.</p>
<p>Despite a -48% retracement from an all-time high of $0.015, $ETHETF now appears poised in a well-defended bullish pendant pattern, with price action coiling up for a major move to the upside.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137746" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701278513-ethetf_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_15-38-37.png" alt="" width="1409" height="625" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701278513-ethetf_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_15-38-37.png 1409w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701278513-ethetf_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_15-38-37-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701278513-ethetf_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_15-38-37-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701278513-ethetf_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_15-38-37-768x341.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1409px) 100vw, 1409px" /></p>
<p>This comes as market confidence returns to the chart, as seen in the steady growth in the number of token holders, which pushed to 751 today, a 50% growth in just two-weeks.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the impressive growth in bag-holders, $ETHETF remains a remarkably low cap proposition &#8211; at just $831k.</p>
<p>Similar DEX-launched meme coins regularly reach $5M market caps, suggesting that $ETHETF could undertake as much as a 6X return from current levels.</p>
<p>Overall, this leaves $ETHETF extremely well-positioned, as any major news event around Ethereum ETFs could trigger a major influx of volume.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a signal of commitment from the project&#8217;s development team, more than $500k of liquidity has been locked &#8211; adding extra reassurance to the mid-term play.</p>
<h2><b>Fidelity Files for Ethereum Spot ETF &#8211; Next Big Price Mover?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the start of a potential catalyst event for an $ETHETF breakout, asset management giant Fidelity has <a href="https://www.cityam.com/seven-days-in-crypto-binances-4-billion-case-and-fidelity-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-as-options-volumes-grow/">submitted </a>19b-4 paperwork to launch an Ethereum Spot ETF on US markets.</p>
<p>The Fidelity Ethereum fund would be listed on an exchange owned by Cboe Global Markets, however, in a unique move Fidelity has taken the bold move of acting as its own custodian.</p>
<p>This bucks a trend of using Coinbase, which is currently poised to become custodian for 68% of Ethereum Spot ETFs.</p>

<p>As TIA price continues to spike following the Celestia airdrop, price action underpinning the leading modular layer-1 blockchain has become supercharged, leaving some to ask &#8216;is it too late to buy Celestia?&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, in a move disappointing markets, despite <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-celestia-going-to-zero-tia-price-suffers-6-fall-as-new-bitcoin-mining-project-takes-all-the-limelight-how-does-it-work.htm">returning to a localized supply zone</a>, TIA price action is now struggling to make moves against upside resistance stemming from the all-time high.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This comes as traders ring the warning bells over Celestia&#8217;s tokenomics, with concerns growing about the aggressive supply schedule, that will see the current 144m circulating supply dilute with more than 850m tokens (unlocking over the next 4 years).</p>
<h2><strong>TIA Price Analysis: Is It Too Late to Buy Celestia As Popular Airdrop Token Struggles With Localized Resistance Level?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With price action struggling to push up into the trading channel, Celestia is current trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TIAUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $6.24</a> (Representing a 24-hour change of +0.04%).</p>
<p>This follows a recent return to the localized supply zone that has appeared between $4.25 and $5, in an emerging double-bottomed move that could fuel TIA price recovery.</p>
<p>The successful re-test of the supply zone has been given additional feet by the arrival of the ascendant 20DMA (currently sat at $5.63).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137643" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262989-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-00-02.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262989-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-00-02.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262989-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-00-02-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262989-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-00-02-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262989-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-00-02-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701262989-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-00-02-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Now providing key footing, the 20DMA has set the stage for TIA price to resume resistance testing around $6.55 &#8211; a step below the all-time high established at $7.30 on November 19.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the bullish posturing above double-bottomed support in the supply zone, TIA price remains vulnerable.</p>
<p>A look at the RSI indicator highlights this predicament, with the substantial upside move at launch triggered a major over-heating to 82.</p>
<p>This has now cooled down, with the RSI currently reading at 62.5, although this remains a bearish signal, with price considered to be overbought at these levels.</p>
<p>Overall, TIA price looks quite healthy here, the double-test of lower support in the supply zone has provided confidence, and with TIA now mounted atop the 20DMA it seems likely a re-test of the ATH is on the way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137644" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701263002-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-01-52.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701263002-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-01-52.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701263002-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-01-52-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701263002-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-01-52-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701263002-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-01-52-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701263002-thumbnail_tiausdt_2023-11-29_13-01-52-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>On the short-time frame, TIA price is left targeting $6.55 (a possible +5.72%).</p>
<p>While downside risk from here could see TIA price return to $5 (a potential -18.33%).</p>
<p>Celestia therefore carries a current risk: reward structure of 0.31 &#8211; a bad entry characterised by outlandish downside risk, suggesting it is too late to buy Celestia.</p>
<p>But while TIA price struggles to push up, an new meme coin presale is rapidly approaching its highly anticipated exchange listing &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to miss this.</p>

<p>Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) governance token ApeCoin is continuing to grind down with resistance as APE price plunges -2% in an hour, but could this surging alternative token be a superior play amid $4.5m investment?</p>

<p>Yet, despite the rocky performance of the BAYC NFT collection, market sentiment for underlying ApeCoin remains strong, with traders betting big on a bullish pendant pattern that seems to suggest APE price is on the precipice of a breakout &#8211; lets dig in.</p>
<h2><strong>APE Price Analysis: Is ApeCoin Going to Zero Amid Trading Channel Resistance Downtick?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As APE price ticks down in face of stiff resistance, ApeCoin is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/APEUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $1.56</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -1.07%).</p>
<p>The recent downside move, triggered by a descendant upper trendline &#8211; which is creating a patch of localized resistance, comes hot on the heels of recent gains which saw APE price hammer up from the 20DM.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137605" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259585-apeusdt_2023-11-29_11-56-07.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259585-apeusdt_2023-11-29_11-56-07.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259585-apeusdt_2023-11-29_11-56-07-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259585-apeusdt_2023-11-29_11-56-07-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259585-apeusdt_2023-11-29_11-56-07-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259585-apeusdt_2023-11-29_11-56-07-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Indeed, the 20DMA (now sat at $1.47) has provided legs to much of the past few weeks ApeCoin price action (which has seen a +11.2% MoM gain), including the push to a localized high of $1.78.</p>
<p>However, APE price now appears to be on a crash course with moving average support following 4-sequential days of downside moves that have so far seen APE price bleed-out -12.5%.</p>
<p>This is bolstered by a further layer of support, stemming from the historic $1.445 price level, giving bears a lower side target at $1.5.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the RSI indicator has managed to cool-down in the midst of the recent downturn, now standing at 56.81 &#8211; this could signal increased capacity for an upside move.</p>
<p>Sentiment is mirrored by the MACD, which despite the downside, is showcasing minor bullish divergence in momentum at 0.011.</p>
<p>APE price is consequently in good form, with strong support to help cement recent gains amid the cool-down in bullish momentum, backed by a bullish pendant pattern, and increasingly bullish signals from key indicators.</p>

<p>On the short-time frame ApeCoin has an upside target at $1.78 (a potential +13.74%).</p>
<p>While downside risk from here could see ApeCoin fall to lower support at $1.5 (a possible -4.15%).</p>
<p>This leaves APE price with an alluring risk: reward ratio of 3.31, a strong entry characterized by significant upside potential &#8211; and certainly not going to zero anytime soon.</p>
<p>But while APE price is battling resistance, a new presale is surging with a dazzling $4.5m raised &#8211; discover <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Smashes $4.5M Raised as Traders Rally Against Bitcoin Mining Centralization</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the 2021 Bull Run, Bitcoin mining has defied expectations by undertaking something of a renaissance in network growth.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate">Hash Rate</a> (a measure of the total amount of computational power directed at mining Bitcoin blocks) has surged to an incredible all-time high of 456.6 Exahashes per second (EH/S).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137599" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259221-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259221-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259221-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259221-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701259221-1700742000-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results">reported that for Q3 2023</a> it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/">a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s</a> (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024.</p>
<p>But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.</p>
<p>A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">55.79%</a> of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.</p>
<p>AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).</p>
<p>This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.</p>

<p>This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>PEPED coin appears to be a quick-fire copycat of a similarly popular meme coin of the same name on BNB Chain &#8211; which acts as the native token for PEPEDAO.</p>
<p>However, this new PEPED token seems to have little to know utility, and no significant marketing presence on social media &#8211; making this a straight up overnight skyrocket.</p>
<h2><strong>PEPED Price Analysis: Is Copycat PEPED Coin Going to Zero Amid Highly Volatile Price Action?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As PEPED coin once again pushes up, PEPED is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xce5a3d3a94edc6c758a882e49ffa9e4004a01603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.0003100</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +1.69%).</p>
<p>This meagre gain comes after a dramatic night of price action on the PEPED chart, with heightened volatility stemming from PEPED coin&#8217;s lowly market cap.#</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137570" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255913-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_10-09-55.png" alt="" width="1409" height="625" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255913-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_10-09-55.png 1409w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255913-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_10-09-55-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255913-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_10-09-55-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255913-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_10-09-55-768x341.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1409px) 100vw, 1409px" /></p>
<p>Indeed, with just 285 holders PEPED&#8217;s mesmerising +1,500% rally was fuelled by a trickle of just $200k in trading volume.</p>
<p>However, PEPED&#8217;s origins go back much further than that with a launch date on November 24.</p>
<p>Initial movements saw PEPED price shoot up from a launch price around $0.00001 to an all-time high of $0.0007275, but this was followed by a failed consolidation, with price subsequently plummeting -97%.</p>
<p>A period of inactivity followed, until at 10AM on November 28 a sudden influx of $200k in trading volume fuelled an impressive +1,500% price move to higher support at $0.000304.</p>
<p>And despite ranks of underwater holders from PEPED&#8217;s November 24 price pump, there has been little sell-off behaviour in this yesterday&#8217;s recovery rally (buy pressure currently stands at 82% of transactions).</p>
<p>This is promising for PEPED&#8217;s future on the short-time frame, with a lowly $310k market cap creating the opportunity for aa quick 3-5x move with very little volume.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137571" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255932-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_11-04-30.png" alt="" width="1409" height="625" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255932-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_11-04-30.png 1409w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255932-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_11-04-30-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255932-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_11-04-30-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701255932-peped_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-29_11-04-30-768x341.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1409px) 100vw, 1409px" /></p>
<p>To the upside, PEPED coin has a target at higher support around $0.0052 (a potential +67% move from here).</p>
<p>While downside risk could see PEPED return to lower baseline support at $0.00016 (a possible -95% drop).</p>
<p>PEPED therefore carries an ongoing risk: reward ratio of 0.71, a bad entry characterised by outsized downside risk, with a substantial risk of becoming exit liquidity.</p>
<p>But while PEPED coin offers an unattractive trade, an emerging Bitcoin ETF themed presale is surging amid heightened market sentiment.</p>

<p>A new Bitcoin alternative presale launched this week, offering eagle-eyed traders the opportunity to make it big on unfolding Bitcoin ETF rumors without having to eat the $37,000 cost of becoming a whole-coiner.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is currently listed at a market price of $0.006, with an alluring $1,960,308 raised in the opening week of the presale.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered">https://twitter.com/BTCETF_Token/status/1729787336630710598</div>
<p>Designed and built with skyrocket potential in mind, this promising token aims to bank big on market excitement surrounding the ongoing applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>
<p>Aiming for a hard cap of $5m in presale funding, the early stage of this emerging project’s presale offers investors a unique opportunity to get in during this early entry point, which could set the stage for life-changing gains.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bitcoin ETF isn’t simply a useless meme coin, beyond taking aim at the biggest narrative in crypto – BTCETF has a major utility: Bitcoin ETF news alerts.</p>
<p>The token’s dApp offers traders a live feed of the latest Bitcoin spot ETF information and news, with sophisticated technology tracking applications real-time at the SEC, and high-speed bots monitoring social media for the latest breaking ETF news.</p>
<p>But a simple feed of Bitcoin Spot ETF news only highlights a fraction of Bitcoin ETF token’s potential, with easy-access to real-time update alerts offering sharp traders the opportunity to make market-beating returns stress-free; being amongst the first to hear about privileged Bitcoin Spot ETF news.</p>
<p>This could enable traders to position themselves appropriately in seismic Bitcoin market movements, making Bitcoin ETF token a critical component in every BTC trader’s tool-box this Winter.</p>
<h2><strong>Surging Interest in Bitcoin Alternatives Leaves $BTCETF Poised to Outperform $FROGE Token</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Project tokenomics are bolstered by ambitious plans for the incorporation of staking rewards that incentivize long-term holding, alongside a burn mechanism, which will enhance $BTCETF as a ‘digital gold’ alternative, by creating a deflationary mechanism in price.</p>
<p>Set for stage 3 of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF project roadmap</a>, an initial burn mechanism will be introduced amid a well-marketed DEX launch, imposing an initial 5% burn tax on transactions – this will be reduced by -1% each time a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is reached.</p>
<p>However, plans are afoot for a larger burn mechanism in stage 4, in a move that will see 25% of token supply burned overtime, this will be conducted in 5% burn intervals – with each supply-side reduction taking place as a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is met.</p>
<p>The milestones for the burn mechanism are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 – <strong>$BTCETF Trading Volume hits $100m</strong> – burn tax on transactions reduced from<strong> 5% to 4%</strong>, and 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 2 – <strong>First Bitcoin ETF is approved by SEC</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>4% to 3%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 3- <strong>First Bitcoin ETF launch date</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>3% to 2%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 4 – <strong>Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) hits $1bn</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>2% to 1%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 5 – <strong>Bitcoin price hits $100k</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>1% to 0%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create a gradual decrease in total supply, eventually leaving around 70% of BTCETF in circulation, with the supply-side reduction inducing upside price growth.</p>
<p>And that is without considering the potential for token value accrual driven by demand from traders for access to the ETF news dApp and the ever-present demand for Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2023 has seen explosive growth in Bitcoin-related tokens – with markets showing a real appetite for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-network-in-flux-as-brc-20-craze-sends-transaction-fees-towards-multi-year-highs-what-next-for-btc-price.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRC-20 ordinal tokens</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-finds-feet-above-34k-while-bitcoin-minetrix-hits-3m.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cloud Mining</a>, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65043a584bebee279199cd55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin derivatives</a>.</p>

<p>Leading Telegram-integrated blockchain The Open Network&#8217;s native Toncoin has seen a magnificent +18% spike in TON price, but is it too late to buy Toncoin?</p>
<p>This comes as TON price reels from a -20% localized retracement move, triggered after pushing to 11-month highs back in early November.</p>
<p>Recent upside price action has been fuelled largely by the launch of Telegram launched &#8216;Giveaways&#8217; a feature enabling channel owners distribute prizes among their followers.</p>

<p>Now with strong support above the 20DMA, TON price action appears to have found legs for a second rally leg &#8211; with sentiment shifting bullish, lets dig in.</p>
<h2><strong>TON Price Analysis: Is is Too Late to Buy Toncoin After +19% Price Spike?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As TON price recovers, Toncoin is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TONCOINUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $2.46</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +0.82%).</p>
<p>Toncoin&#8217;s ongoing upside move, which was mounted following the -20% retracement, appears to have found legs above the 20DMA (sat at $2.38).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137186" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180662-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-07-48.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180662-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-07-48.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180662-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-07-48-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180662-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-07-48-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180662-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-07-48-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180662-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-07-48-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>This key moving average has provided localized support for a +11.5% recovery so far, with TON price action forming a bullish pendant pattern in the upper trading channel.</p>
<p>TON price now appears poised, ready for another breakout above trendline resistance, with a potential target at $2.9.</p>
<p>200DMA support remains far below price action despite the golden cross on September 15, although the moving average is now gradually ascendant at $1.8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the RSI while bearish at 58.56 suggests there is still the capacity for a significant upside move, with the previous 11-month high registering at 79.39 on the RSI indicator.</p>
<p>This sentiment is backed by a completely neutral MACD, which is on the fence at 0.00 &#8211; this comes as the indicator flips from bearish to bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>Overall, TON price looks acutely poised here, with an imminent retest of upper trendline resistance firmly on the cards.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137188" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180684-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-08-31.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180684-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-08-31.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180684-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-08-31-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180684-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-08-31-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180684-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-08-31-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701180684-thumbnail_tonusdt_2023-11-28_14-08-31-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>On the short-time frame, TON price has a target at $2.75 (a potential +11.16%).</p>
<p>While downside risk from here appears limited by the 20DMA at $2.38 (a possible -3.8%).</p>
<p>This leaves TON price with a risk: reward structure of 2.94, a strong entry characterised by good upside returns on the short-time frame, and certainly <strong>not too late to buy</strong>.</p>
<p>But while Toncoin offers an alluring+11.16% return, supercharged gains are often found through early backer status &#8211; imagine if you could have bought TON price at $0.74.</p>
<p>You can lock-in similar supersized returns by participating in project presales, one such event exploding in crypto markets is an emerging Telegram-based casino with the potential to make it big off the Telegram narrative like Toncoin.</p>

<p>The presale is where things get even more intriguing as the offered staking APY is nothing short of spectacular, standing proudly at 191%.</p>
<p>Given that over a million tokens have been staked within a day of the presale launch, the momentum is palpable.</p>
<p>And a well-conceived buyback mechanism ensures price stability and regular rewards, a win-win for the community.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino">$TGC token’s utility</a> is another aspect to spotlight – beyond its primary function in the casino world, its adaptability – be it swapped for gaming credits or other cryptos – adds layers to its potential growth.</p>
<p>Its role in transactions, from deposits to withdrawals, signifies its pivotal role in the TG.Casino framework.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Buy TG Casino Early?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Go over to their official website</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you want to get correctly is going over to their<a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino"> official website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 – Create a Crypto Wallet</strong></p>
<p>You need to set up a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">crypto wallet</a>, and it’s important to chose a wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens as this is TGC Standards.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 – Purchase ETH or USDT</strong></p>
<p>Next is to purchase some Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT), as these are the tokens used to exchange into TGC.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 – Connect Wallet to Presale Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/tgcasino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TG.Casino’s website</a> and click on the ‘Connect Wallet’ button. A pop-up box will appear, in which investors can choose their wallet provider and link their wallet to the presale dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 – Buy TG.Casino Token</strong></p>
<p>Investors will see an order box on-screen where they can either select ETH or USDT (or buy on BSC) to use for the exchange. Investors also need to decide the amount of $TGC coin you want to buy; the minimum investment is 1,000 $TGC. After making sure that everything is accurate, confirm the trade.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 – Claim TG.Casino Token</strong></p>
<p>Once TG.Casino’s presale has ended, there will be a Token Generation Event (TGE), where investors can claim their purchased tokens by clicking the ‘Claim’ button on TG.Casino’s homepage. That’s all for how to buy TG.Casino.</p>

<p>As airdrop tokens dominate market activity, Pyth Network&#8217;s decentralized oracle token $PYTH price dropped -10% overnight, leading some concerned airdrop participants asking &#8216;is Pyth Network going to zero?&#8217;.</p>
<p>This comes amid broader market interest in airdrops following the break-out performance of modular layer-1 blockchain Celestia (TIA) &#8211; which has <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celestia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploded +173%</a> since launching earlier in Q3.</p>

<p>Subsequent Solana-based airdrop PYTH (orange) has battled to match TIA&#8217;s star-studded growth <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-pyth-network-pyth-price-erupts-53-after-airdrop-and-this-might-be-the-next-crypto-to-explode.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in recent weeks</a>, yet, so far Pyth Network seems to be struggling to replicate TIA&#8217;s (blue) skyrocket success.</p>
<h2><strong>PYTH Price Analysis: Is Pyth Network Going to Zero as Pyth Price Falls -10% Overnight?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Amid the downside price action, Pyth Network is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/PYTHUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.4226</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -1.68%).</p>
<p>This comes as PYTH price shifts down into the lower range of the trading channel, in a -24.5% retracement move following a tough layer of resistance at the ATH of $0.55.</p>
<p>However, this also comes at a time when PYTH price is showing strength, as the retracement movement finds well-defended feet above $0.40 and the 20DMA (sat at $0.41), both of which are now bolstering Pyth Network&#8217;s ongoing consolidation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137100" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170417-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-08-20.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170417-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-08-20.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170417-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-08-20-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170417-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-08-20-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170417-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-08-20-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170417-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-08-20-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>PYTH price is, therefore, poised for a second rally leg, with the healthy downshift cementing +46% week-on-week gains.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the RSI indicator has also refrained from overheating on the recent move, with a current neutral signal at 53, leaving the door open to upside movements from here.</p>
<p>Bullish sentiment is matched by the MACD indicator, which is signaling minor divergence at 0.0024 as upside momentum resumes.</p>
<p>Overall, PYTH price looks strong here, with a well-defended consolidation foreshadowing the next upside leg, it seems likely that Pyth Network will push back up to the upper side of the trading channel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137102" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170440-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-17-45.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170440-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-17-45.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170440-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-17-45-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170440-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-17-45-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170440-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-17-45-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170440-thumbnail_pythusdt_2023-11-28_11-17-45-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>PYTH price, therefore, has an upside target at higher support around $0.47 (a potential +10.28%).</p>
<p>While downside risk could see PYTH price fall back down to $0.38 (a potential -10,84%).</p>
<p>Ongoing PYTH price action carries a consequent risk: reward ratio of 0.95, a bad entry characterized by limited upside potential on the short-time frame, yet, certainly<strong> not going to zero</strong> anytime soon.</p>

<p>With the Bitcoin Minetrix approach, gone are the days of heavy initial capital and navigating complex mining contracts.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Smashes $4.48M Raised as Traders Rally Against Bitcoin Mining Centralization</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the 2021 Bull Run, Bitcoin mining has defied expectations by undertaking something of a renaissance in network growth.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate">Hash Rate</a> (a measure of the total amount of computational power directed at mining Bitcoin blocks) has surged to an incredible all-time high of 456.6 Exahashes per second (EH/S).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137104" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170561-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170561-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170561-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170561-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170561-1700567694-1699982703-hash-rate-1-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results">reported that for Q3 2023</a> it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/">a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s</a> (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024.</p>
<p>But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.</p>
<p>A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">55.79%</a> of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.</p>
<p>AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).</p>
<p>This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.</p>

<p>This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137107" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170608-1700567833-1699982754-difficulty-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170608-1700567833-1699982754-difficulty-1.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170608-1700567833-1699982754-difficulty-1-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170608-1700567833-1699982754-difficulty-1-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701170608-1700567833-1699982754-difficulty-1-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>This challenge of heightened network difficulty, fuelled by increased competition and centralization of mining power, has created the need for new solutions for the retail investor to participate in Bitcoin mining – both for network decentralization and preserving Bitcoin as a profitable activity for the individual.</p>
<p>Enter Bitcoin Minetrix, which was launched to deliver secure and transparent Bitcoin mining rewards for the retail investor through an innovative, decentralized Bitcoin cloud mining approach.</p>

<p>With little to no marketing on social media, the obscure new 10000x token appears to be a straight up high-risk moon-shot attempt, with price action undertaking volatile moves amid no liquidity lock.</p>
<h2><strong>10000X Price Analysis: As New Moon-Shot Attempt $10000X Token Posts +5,000% Move &#8211; Are There Better Alternatives?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Amid a seismic dumping move, the mysterious 10000X Token is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x830590df97b5a181ecc665f94e5287b75692606c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.00001023</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -97.6%).</p>
<p>The downside cascade has broken out over the past two hours, with the price plummeting from a top of $0.00425 as the unlocked liquidity pool began draining away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137056" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701166364-10000x_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-28_10-01-44.png" alt="" width="1409" height="623" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701166364-10000x_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-28_10-01-44.png 1409w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701166364-10000x_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-28_10-01-44-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701166364-10000x_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-28_10-01-44-1024x453.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701166364-10000x_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-28_10-01-44-768x340.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1409px) 100vw, 1409px" /></p>
<p>This comes despite rocketing to a $10m market cap yesterday, in a dazzling move, that saw price shoot up a whopping +3,581% in the first hour of trading.</p>
<p>Yet, although 10000X token was able to undertake a sensational upside move &#8211; price action remained static in consolidation above $0.004.</p>
<p>Across 12 hours trading there was little to no volatility, highlighting the suspicious nature of this likely rug-pull coin.</p>
<p>However, this failed to deter 300 &#8211; now fearful holders &#8211; that rushed into the chart amid 82% buy-volume, ahead of the dramatic dumping price action.</p>
<p>This goes to highlight the risks of DEX traded tokens &#8211; with significant dumping moves pushing smart money away towards safer early-backer plays like presales.</p>
<p>One such ongoing presale is surging as markets brace for the arrival of highly anticipated Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>

<p>A new Bitcoin alternative presale launched this week, offering eagle-eyed traders the opportunity to make it big on unfolding Bitcoin ETF rumors without having to eat the $37,000 cost of becoming a whole-coiner.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is currently listed at a market price of $0.006, with an alluring $1,909,232 raised in the opening week of the presale.</p>

<p>Designed and built with skyrocket potential in mind, this promising token aims to bank big on market excitement surrounding the ongoing applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bitcoin ETF isn’t simply a useless meme coin, beyond taking aim at the biggest narrative in crypto – BTCETF has a major utility: Bitcoin ETF news alerts.</p>
<p>The token’s dApp offers traders a live feed of the latest Bitcoin spot ETF information and news, with sophisticated technology tracking applications real-time at the SEC, and high-speed bots monitoring social media for the latest breaking ETF news.</p>
<p>But a simple feed of Bitcoin Spot ETF news only highlights a fraction of Bitcoin ETF token’s potential, with easy-access to real-time update alerts offering sharp traders the opportunity to make market-beating returns stress-free; being amongst the first to hear about privileged Bitcoin Spot ETF news.</p>
<p>This could enable traders to position themselves appropriately in seismic Bitcoin market movements, making Bitcoin ETF token a critical component in every BTC trader’s tool-box this Winter.</p>
<h2><strong>Surging Interest in Bitcoin Alternatives Leaves $BTCETF Poised to Outperform $FROGE Token</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Project tokenomics are bolstered by ambitious plans for the incorporation of staking rewards that incentivize long-term holding, alongside a burn mechanism, which will enhance $BTCETF as a ‘digital gold’ alternative, by creating a deflationary mechanism in price.</p>
<p>Set for stage 3 of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF project roadmap</a>, an initial burn mechanism will be introduced amid a well-marketed DEX launch, imposing an initial 5% burn tax on transactions – this will be reduced by -1% each time a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is reached.</p>
<p>However, plans are afoot for a larger burn mechanism in stage 4, in a move that will see 25% of token supply burned overtime, this will be conducted in 5% burn intervals – with each supply-side reduction taking place as a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is met.</p>
<p>The milestones for the burn mechanism are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 – <strong>$BTCETF Trading Volume hits $100m</strong> – burn tax on transactions reduced from<strong> 5% to 4%</strong>, and 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 2 – <strong>First Bitcoin ETF is approved by SEC</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>4% to 3%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 3- <strong>First Bitcoin ETF launch date</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>3% to 2%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 4 – <strong>Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) hits $1bn</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>2% to 1%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 5 – <strong>Bitcoin price hits $100k</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>1% to 0%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create a gradual decrease in total supply, eventually leaving around 70% of BTCETF in circulation, with the supply-side reduction inducing upside price growth.</p>
<p>And that is without considering the potential for token value accrual driven by demand from traders for access to the ETF news dApp and the ever-present demand for Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2023 has seen explosive growth in Bitcoin-related tokens – with markets showing a real appetite for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-network-in-flux-as-brc-20-craze-sends-transaction-fees-towards-multi-year-highs-what-next-for-btc-price.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRC-20 ordinal tokens</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-finds-feet-above-34k-while-bitcoin-minetrix-hits-3m.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cloud Mining</a>, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65043a584bebee279199cd55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin derivatives</a>.</p>

<p>NEO&#8217;s native settlement GAS token, has undertaken a price explosion, with GAS price pushing up +11.5% despite serious retracement, is it too late to buy GAS token?</p>
<p>GAS is a settlement token, generated by staked NEO, which is used to pay for transactions on the NEO network.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, there has been a dramatic growth in GAS price as traders rush to stack bags following the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-neo-neo-price-gains-34-as-a-fresh-new-telegram-casino-token-grabs-attention.htm">news that GAS will be used for settlement</a> on NEO&#8217;s sidechains.</p>
<p>This has led to increased <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moments of divergence</a>, where the price of GAS (in orange) exceeds that of underlying token NEO (in blue).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136207" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700830482-neo_7d_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="" width="1018" height="356" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700830482-neo_7d_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg 1018w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700830482-neo_7d_graph_coinmarketcap-300x105.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700830482-neo_7d_graph_coinmarketcap-768x269.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<p>But with price dropping in heavy retracement following a new all-time high, this bounce-back move has got markets super-charged &#8211; lets dig in.</p>
<h2><strong>GAS Price Analysis: Will GAS Price Bounce Back to Continue Sidechain Rally?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With the chart super-charged following the bounce back, GAS is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/GASUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $8.91</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +1.13%).</p>
<p>This comes after GAS price found feet above the $7.175 supper level which was established originally at the start of November.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136215" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700831298-thumbnail_gasusdt_2023-11-24_13-00-28.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700831298-thumbnail_gasusdt_2023-11-24_13-00-28.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700831298-thumbnail_gasusdt_2023-11-24_13-00-28-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700831298-thumbnail_gasusdt_2023-11-24_13-00-28-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700831298-thumbnail_gasusdt_2023-11-24_13-00-28-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700831298-thumbnail_gasusdt_2023-11-24_13-00-28-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Ongoing GAS price action has created a pan-handle pattern on the chart, which bolsters technical structure &#8211; still strong after the golden cross on October 29.</p>
<p>Currently the 20DMA is sat above price action, creating a potential ceiling of localized resistance around $10.75.</p>
<p>However, the 200DMA remains low, providing bed-rock support at $3.5.</p>
<p>In a bullish display, the RSI indicator has cooled-off significantly from a major over-bought signal on November 10, to a neutral on the fence reading at 51 today.</p>
<p>This suggests price action is now ripe and ready to push-up on a second run, however, the MACD flags stalling momentum with bearish divergence at -0.509.</p>
<p>Overall, GAS looks strong here, having successfully consolidated after a much-needed consolidation, suggesting price can once again resume upside movements.</p>

<p>GAS price has an upside target at 20DMA resistance around $10.75 on the short-time frame (a potential +21.21%).</p>
<p>While downside risk could see GAS price plummet down to lower support at $7.18 (a possible -19.04%).</p>
<p>This leaves GAS price with a risk: reward ratio of 1.11 on the short-time frame, suggesting that it is not too late to buy GAS at current prices.</p>
<p>But while GAS offers a potentially alluring gain on the short-time frame, a better opportunity emerges from a new meme coin presale that has matched NEO&#8217;s explosive November growth, meet Meme Kombat.</p>

<p>Rising GameFi project Illuvium, the decentralized studio building the world&#8217;s first interoperable blockchain gaming universe, has seen a -6.2% retracement move for ILV price, and some worried bag-holders are now asking &#8216;is Illuvium going to zero?&#8217;.</p>
<p>This comes following <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-9-kaspa-illuvium-mina-protocol.htm">something of a recovery as of late</a>, after a disappointing -97% performance since 2021 for what was one of the most anticipated crypto game releases in history.</p>
<p>Yet, retracement move has been triggered by a multi-month trading channel, which has formed a capstone of resistance for any significant move above $110 since August.</p>

<p>Market sentiment is ring alarm bells, as prominent traders warn of a serious risk of retracement here &#8211; lets take a closer look.</p>
<h2><strong>ILV Price Analysis: Is Illuvium Going to Zero After Trading Channel Triggers Retracement Move?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AS ILV price reels following rejection from upper trendline resistance, Illuvium is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ILVUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $101</a> (representing a 24-hour change of 2.83%).</p>
<p>This comes after the ILV price rally, which has gained +194% over the past month, hit a localized top of $112 &#8211; sending price tumbling into retracement.</p>
<p>However, so far the drop has been well-defended by ILV bulls, with a local support level established in a zone between $84 and $100 over the weeks preceding the test of upper trendline resistance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136182" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827458-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-02-13.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827458-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-02-13.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827458-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-02-13-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827458-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-02-13-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827458-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-02-13-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827458-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-02-13-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>Yet, the shift into the upper trading channel comes at a time of immense strength in ILV price, following a golden cross between moving averages in early November, which has since seen the ascendant 20DMA (sat at $87) providing footing to the impressive price growth.</p>
<p>It seems likely that given the well defended bullish pendant structure, ILV price will continue to consolidate at these levels, awaiting a rise in the 20DMA to attempt a second re-test of the upper trendline.</p>
<p>In a further sign of encouragement, the RSI has cooled-down substantially amid the drop in ILV price, now reading only minor bearish divergence at 63.</p>
<p>This suggests there could soon be the capacity for upside movements to resume, and this sentiment is backed by the MACD, which shows continued bullish divergence at 0.079.</p>
<p>Overall, ILV price looks incredibly healthy here, with a well-defended retracement move, leading to consolidation ahead of a second retest of the ongoing resistance level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136183" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827475-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-03-07.png" alt="" width="1634" height="901" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827475-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-03-07.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827475-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-03-07-300x165.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827475-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-03-07-1024x565.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827475-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-03-07-768x423.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700827475-thumbnail_ilvusdt_2023-11-24_12-03-07-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>This leaves ILV price with an upside target at resistance around $112 (a potential +11.12%).</p>
<p>While downside risk could see ILV price fall back down to the 20DMA at $87 (a possible -13.7%).</p>
<p>Illuvium therefore carries a current risk: reward ratio of 0.81 &#8211; a bad entry &#8211; worthy of patience while the 20DMA catches up, but certainly not going to zero just yet.</p>
<p>But as ILV price awaits consolidation, traders are shifting their attention to a moon-shot Bitcoin cloud mining play that could make it big over the next year.</p>

<p>This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results">reported that for Q3 2023</a> it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/">a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s</a> (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024.</p>
<p>But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.</p>
<p>A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">55.79%</a> of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.</p>
<p>AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).</p>
<p>This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.</p>

<p>This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>In the latest twist, Froge token (FROGE) has exploded on DEX markets after being mentioned by OpenAI President Greg Brockman on Twitter, and with traders betting this ETF token will be next &#8211; lets dig in.</p>
<p>Recent months have seen a huge trend in explosive DEX-traded token moves, with countless moon-shots garnering significant attention, including the ever-popular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/it-too-late-buy-astropepex-apx-price-climbs-30-as-crypto-market-turns-bullish-tg-casino-set-100x-1.htm">APX</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/samurai-bot-sambo-explodes-after-bitcoin-price-breakout.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAMBO Bot</a>,<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-otk-token-goes-up-5x-overnight-this-new-bitcoin-project-just-raised-3-5-million.htm"> Baby Meme</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-time-token-surges-1000-this-emerging-crypto-has-announced-a-revolutionary-protocol-next-big-thing.htm">TIME</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-rocky-token-surges-270x-in-24-hours-investors-are-turning-their-attention-to-this-other-bitcoin-etf-project-how-does-it-work.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROCKY</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-little-known-io-token-soars-5800-in-24-hours-this-under-the-radar-crypto-could-be-next-to-explode-heres-why.htm">IO</a>.</p>
<p>The sensational rally for FROGE appears to have been fuelled by meme narrative sentiment, triggered after OpenAI President Greg Brockman posted a photo on X (Twitter).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">spotted in the NYT today — froge is now famous: <a href="https://t.co/QMM76DAGVm">pic.twitter.com/QMM76DAGVm</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Greg Brockman (@gdb) <a href="https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1727520677878747469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the image, on the back of an OpenAI employee&#8217;s laptop, there is a sticker of crypto meme Froge the Frog.</p>
<p>With the posted photo acting as a quasi-endorsement of the meme, DEX markets didn&#8217;t skip a beat in racing into the latest Froge moon-shot.</p>
<h2><strong>FROGE Price Analysis: How Long Will OpenAI FROGE Token Skyrocket Last &#8211; Doomed to Dump?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price action attempts to sustain upside momentum, FROGE token is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x198a62268f29d72634b634f80def70c156215485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.0000000007720</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +5,530%).</p>
<p>With price pushing up, the uptick over the past hour comes as FROGE fights to consolidate new found gains, after hammering-up out of obscurity following the Brockman tweet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136146" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700821988-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-31-12.png" alt="" width="1409" height="631" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700821988-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-31-12.png 1409w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700821988-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-31-12-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700821988-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-31-12-1024x459.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700821988-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-31-12-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1409px) 100vw, 1409px" /></p>
<p>The rally was triggered at 12:00 on November 23, with an absolute flood of more than $16.2m in volume surging into the chart &#8211; in a move that saw more than 200 holders take position.</p>
<p>This drove an impress rally, with a strong support zone established between $0.0000000004675 and $0.000000000800, which is currently providing a supply zone to attempts at consolidation.</p>
<p>But with Froge token&#8217;s market cap now stood at $5m (towards the top end for most short-lived meme coin runs) it seems likely that momentum could flag from here, which can be seen reflected in the shifting transaction balance as sell pressure takes hold at 65%.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the sell-pressure, FROGE is showing signs of strength, with the consolidation move above the support zone proving to be a well-defended level on the chart.</p>
<p>And, bullish sentiment could be bolstered by the positive steps taken by the token contract developer, which has left price action protected by $771k in locked liquidity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136148" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700822008-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-32-54.png" alt="" width="1409" height="631" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700822008-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-32-54.png 1409w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700822008-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-32-54-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700822008-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-32-54-1024x459.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700822008-froge_usd-uni-dextools-io_2023-11-24_10-32-54-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1409px) 100vw, 1409px" /></p>
<p>Overall, from here FROGE has an upside target at $0.000000001225 (a possible +60%), while downside risk could see FROGE fall to $0.000000004675 (a potential -38%).</p>
<p>This leaves FROGE with a risk: reward ratio of 1.56 &#8211; a good entry characterised by reasonable upside risk &#8211; despite the high risk nature of DEX trading.</p>
<p>But while some traders are sizing up a late stage entry into the fleeting Froge rally, smart money are flocking to early-backer status in a breakout ETF-themed crypto presale.</p>

<p>A new Bitcoin alternative presale launched this week, offering eagle-eyed traders the opportunity to make it big on unfolding Bitcoin ETF rumors, without having to eat the $37,000 cost of becoming a wholecoiner.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bitcoin ETF isn’t simply a useless meme coin, beyond taking aim at the biggest narrative in crypto – BTCETF has a major utility: Bitcoin ETF news alerts.</p>
<p>The token’s dApp offers traders a live-feed of the latest Bitcoin spot ETF information and news, with sophisticated technology tracking applications real-time at the SEC, and high-speed bots monitoring social media for the latest breaking ETF news.</p>
<p>But a simple feed of Bitcoin spot ETF news only highlights a fraction of Bitcoin ETF token’s potential, with easy-access to real-time update alerts offering sharp traders the opportunity to make market-beating returns stress-free; being amongst the first to hear about privileged Bitcoin Spot ETF news.</p>
<p>This could enable traders to position themselves appropriately in seismic Bitcoin market movements, making Bitcoin ETF token a critical component in every BTC trader’s tool-box this Winter.</p>

Project tokenomics are bolstered by ambitious plans for the incorporation of staking rewards that incentivise long-term holding, alongside a burn mechanism, which will enhance $BTCETF as a ‘digital gold’ alternative, by creating a deflationary mechanism in price.</p>
<p>Set for stage 3 of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin ETF project roadmap</a>, an initial burn mechanism will be introduced amid a well-marketed DEX launch, imposing an initial 5% burn tax on transactions – this will be reduced by -1% each time a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is reached.</p>
<p>However, plans are afoot for a larger burn mechanism in stage 4, in a move that will see 25% of token supply burned overtime, this will be conducted in 5% burn intervals – with each supply-side reduction taking place as a Bitcoin ETF news milestone is met.</p>
<p>The milestones for the burn mechanism are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 – <strong>$BTCETF Trading Volume hits $100m</strong> – burn tax on transactions reduced from<strong> 5% to 4%</strong>, and 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 2 – <strong>First Bitcoin ETF is approved by SEC</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>4% to 3%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 3- <strong>First Bitcoin ETF launch date</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>3% to 2%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 4 – <strong>Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) hits $1bn</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>2% to 1%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
<li>Milestone 5 – <strong>Bitcoin price hits $100k</strong> – burn tax on transactions is reduced from <strong>1% to 0%</strong>, and a further 5% of total supply is burned.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create a gradual decrease in total supply, eventually leaving around 70% of BTCETF in circulation, with the supply side reduction inducing upside price growth.</p>
<p>And that is without considering the potential for token value accrual driven by demand from traders for access to the ETF news dApp and the ever-present demand for Bitcoin alternatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2023 has seen explosive growth in Bitcoin related tokens – with markets showing a real appetite for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-network-in-flux-as-brc-20-craze-sends-transaction-fees-towards-multi-year-highs-what-next-for-btc-price.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRC-20 ordinal tokens</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-finds-feet-above-34k-while-bitcoin-minetrix-hits-3m.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cloud Mining</a>, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65043a584bebee279199cd55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin derivatives</a>.</p>
