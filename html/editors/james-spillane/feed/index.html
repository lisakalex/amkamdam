<p>The Wall Street Memes crypto project&#8217;s presale began May 26, 2023, at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>wallstmemes.com</u></a>.</p>
<p>This guide outlines how to invest in the Wall Street Memes presale using a crypto wallet such as a MetaMask or Trust Wallet. A &#8216;how to buy&#8217; section is also included on the official WSM presale website.</p>
<p>The presale has become one of the best ever, rasing more than <strong>$25 million since it launched</strong>, with WSM also offering passive rewards through its staking mechanism &#8211; the current APY sits at 50%.</p>
<p>However, investors need to move quickly to secure their tokens before the presale ends, with a <strong>closing date of 6pm UTC on September 25</strong> ahead of what is expected to be an explosive IEO.</p>
<p>The IEO, which takes place on <strong>September 26</strong>, will be hosted on a tier-1 centralized exchange, with full details to be released imminently.</p>

<h2>What is the Wall Street Memes Presale?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The Wall Street Memes presale is open to the public and a way to invest in WSM coin before it is listed on crypto exchanges in Q3 &#8211; Q4 2023.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115166/277773/buy-wall-street-memes-token.jpg" alt="$WSM Token History" />

</figure>
<p>As a meme coin, its use case is for speculation and a rewards token for its community of investors and traders following the Reddit subculture that grew out of the &#8216;<i>infamous GameStop fiasco of 2021, and the legacy of those brave Wall Street Bets heroes</i>&#8216; that still endures today.</p>
<p>While they lack utility, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm"><u>meme tokens</u></a> have been the best-performing assets of each crypto bull run, whether Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2021, or Pepe (PEPE) in 2023 following the Bitcoin price starting to recover from the 2022 bear market.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">30 year old mfs going to work while 16 year old Kyle turned his $670 investment in a shitcoin named <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a> into $900,000 <a href="https://t.co/gUrxAci2Ox">pic.twitter.com/gUrxAci2Ox</a></p>&mdash; Wall Street Memes (@wallstmemes) <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes/status/1654501685891407874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Pepe bull run turned many meme coin investors into millionaires. The &#8216;<i>$WSM army</i>&#8216; hopes to replicate some of that success and show that &#8216;<i>greed is good</i>&#8216; &#8211; a slogan used by composite character Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes crypto asset is a way to &#8216;<i>tokenize the movement</i>&#8216; and 100% of its 2 billion supply will be able to be held and traded by the community, with 50% set aside for presale buyers, 30% for community rewards, and 20% for liquidity once WSM token is listed on exchanges.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115166/277775/buy-wall-street-memes-cry.jpg" alt="Wall Street Memes Tokenomics " /></figure>
<p>Unlike some meme coins created spontaneously, Wall Street Memes token already has a wide backing from one million followers across its <a href="https://linktr.ee/wallstmemes"><u>social channels</u></a> due its popular NFT collections and Instagram memes centered around investing in crypto and stocks, or &#8216;stonks&#8217;.</p>
<h2>How to Buy Wall Street Memes Crypto &#8211; Step by Step</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>To invest in Wall Street Memes token during the presale, follow these steps:</p>
<h3>1. Open a Crypto Wallet</h3>
<p>To invest in crypto presales via desktop a MetaMask wallet is the most commonly used option &#8211; follow the instructions to set up a new wallet on <a href="https://metamask.io/"><u>metamask.io</u></a> if you don&#8217;t already have one.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115166/277784/buy-wall-street-memes-cry.jpg" alt="Web3 Mobile Wallet Options" /></figure>
<p>On mobile, <a href="https://trustwallet.com/deeplink/"><u>Trust Wallet</u></a> is often preferred, the official wallet of Binance exchange. It is available on the App Store or Google Play. It does also have a desktop version. For this guide, we&#8217;ll be using Trust Wallet.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes presale also supports a wide number of other options, under the WalletConnect option.</p>
<h3>2. Connect Wallet</h3>
<p>Visit the official website <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>wallstmemes.com</u></a> &#8211; beware of fake sites that often impersonate popular crypto presales &#8211; and click &#8216;Connect Wallet&#8217;. </p>
<p>After selecting e.g. the Trust Wallet option, you&#8217;ll be prompted to connect with a message &#8216;Wall Street Memes wants to connect to your wallet&#8217;. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115166/277786/invest-in-wall-street-mem.jpg" alt="WSM To Web3 Wallet Connection" /></figure>
<p>Note that you will not be required to provide your seed phrase, and never are with any crypto project &#8211; admins do not require it. If you are asked to provide that backup phrase or &#8216;validate your wallet&#8217; to buy tokens or receive an airdrop, that will be a fake domain operated by scammers. </p>
<h3>3. Swap ETH, BNB or USDT for $WSM</h3>
<p>Enter an amount of ETH, USDT, or BNB to swap for $WSM &#8211; the amount you will receive is displayed before confirming the buy order.</p>
<p>Ethereum, Tether and Binance Coin can be bought from a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/"><u>crypto exchange</u></a> or directly within many crypto wallets.</p>
<p>Note the gas fees &#8211; these vary by the time of day.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115166/277787/buy-wall-street-memes-tokens.jpg" alt="Swap ETH For $WSM" /></figure>
<p>The $WSM price also rises over time to provide a discount to early buyers &#8211; the initial stage (shown above) sold out within 48 hours due to high demand.</p>
<p>When then clicking &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; in Trust Wallet, the message &#8216;smart contract call executed&#8217; will be displayed and the details summarized on the next screen &#8211; with the Wall Street Memes Dapp (wallstmemes.com) and network fees.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/115166/277789/buy-wall-street-memes-coins.jpg" alt="Trust Wallet Smart Contract Call" /></figure>
<p>An option to buy Wall Street Memes token with a debit / credit card is also available.</p>
<h3>4. Claim Tokens</h3>
<p>Once the presale concludes, connect your wallet once again and WSM tokens will be transferred to your wallet. </p>
<p>Follow the Wall Street Memes presale <a href="https://linktr.ee/wallstmemes"><u>social channels</u></a> for announcements of the exact claim time and date, and the DEX and CEX listings that will take place shortly after.</p>

<p>Prior to the Wall Street Memes presale claim date, your amount of purchased $WSM can be viewed on the official website by visiting it and connecting your wallet.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>During the Wall Street Memes presale rounds, to invest in WSM token connect a crypto wallet to the official site and swap ETH, USDT or BNB for WSM, or use a bank card. So far, <strong>more than $25 million has been raised</strong> since the project launched in late May.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes also allows holders to generate passive income through its staking mechanism, with the <strong>presale to close on September 25</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember admins will not message you first on platforms such as Discord, Telegram, Instagram or Twitter &#8211; its official handles are on its <a href="https://linktr.ee/wallstmemes"><u>Linktree</u></a>.</p>
<p>Keep your crypto wallet backup phrase (seed phrase) and any other passwords / two-factor authentication secure and don&#8217;t share them with anyone. Losing access to your wallet or being compromised by phishing links may prevent your $WSM tokens from being claimed.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t approve any transactions you are unsure of, and always use official links &#8211; the only place to buy Wall Street Memes token before its DEX and CEX listings is on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>wallstmemes.com</u></a>.</p>

<p>Inspired by how the little guy challenged Wall St in the GameStop short squeeze, Wall Street Memes (WSM) is one of the newest meme tokens, currently on presale.</p>
<p>The bull run for the GME and AMC stock price in 2021 inspired several new crypto projects and a whole internet meme subculture. Crypto has its own version of meme stocks &#8211; meme coins &#8211; with traders always hunting the next Dogecoin to explode when noticed by Elon Musk, the next Shiba Inu, or most recently the next Pepe to outperform the entire market by tens of thousands of percent.</p>
<p>Does $WSM have what it takes to be the next big crypto? This Wall Street Memes token price prediction reviews the project&#8217;s roadmap and future upside potential.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Price Prediction &#8211; Key Points</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of 2023: </strong>The Wall Street Memes token presale began at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>wallstmemes.com</u></a> on May 26, 2023, selling out its first presale round by raising $500,000 within 48 hours. With a hard cap target of $30,577,000, it may sell out and have its first DEX and CEX listings by Q4 2023.</li>
<li><strong>2024 &#8211; 2025:</strong> While the $WSM listing price hasn&#8217;t been confirmed, with the incremental price stages during the presale and its 2 billion supply &#8211; 50% of which is allocated to the presale &#8211; the Wall Street Memes market cap at launch will be just under $35 million. New meme coins that build a community often test the $100 million market cap level shortly after their ICO.</li>
<li><strong>Up to 2030:</strong> Meme coins already often outperform BTC and ETH &#8211; if the next crypto bull run takes place after 2024&#8217;s Bitcoin halving the rise of meme assets could continue. New entrants to crypto as the blockchain sees mass adoption could gravitate towards coins like Wall Street Memes, backed by a community whose content Elon Musk has at one point interacted with. Pepe hit an almost $2bn market cap in 2023 even as a relatively unknown asset.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wall Street Memes Price Stages</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The WSM coin price started at $0.025 during its first presale round, which sold out within days and is now priced slightly higher, still affording a discount to early buyers &#8211; to incentivize those taking on the most risk. The Wall Street Memes price stages at presale are:</p>

<p>The thirty total Wall Street Memes presale stages equate to a 34.8% increase in the WSM token price prior to its listing on exchanges. The WSM listing price may be its final stage price, $0.0337 or slightly higher &#8211; likely to be confirmed after the presale concludes.</p>
<p>For the latest announcements, the Wall Street Memes crypto project posted a <a href="https://linktr.ee/wallstmemes"><u>Linktree</u></a> of all its official social media channels &#8211; beware of impersonators when investing in crypto presales, admins of projects will also not DM you first as a general policy.</p>

<h2>What is the Wall Street Memes Crypto Project?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Prior to launching its new crypto token, the Wall Street Memes community itself was based around an Instagram and Twitter community and a legacy NFT project. Its main accounts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes"><u>@wallstmemes</u></a> on Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/"><u>@wallstbets</u></a> on Instagram</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has a separate Twitter and IG for NFT focused posts, and a recently launched <a href="https://discord.gg/4E538pzeGX"><u>Discord</u></a> and <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes"><u>Telegram</u></a>, the preferred platforms for new crypto projects. Prior to creating those to organize its presale, Wall Street Memes already benefitted from an existing backing of one million followers.</p>
<figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&#8221;https://twitter.com/wallstmemes/status/1662474606794493954[/embed]
<p>In 2021 the platform developed its first NFT project, the Wall St Bulls on OpenSea, selling out that mint <a href="https://newsdirect.com/news/wall-street-memes-crypto-presale-raises-100k-in-a-flash-is-wsm-token-next-pepecoin-or-shiba-inu-592230125"><u>in 32 minutes</u></a>. </p>
<p>It continues to launch new NFT projects, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/wall-street-memes-crypto-presale-raises-100k-minutes-after-launch-next-pepe-coin-or-dogecoin.htm"><u>Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs</u></a> in May 2023 and with meme coins being the most exciting assets of the year, announced its WSM coin presale shortly after.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Price Prediction 2023</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Our resident crypto analyst reviewed the Wall Street Memes presale on its launch day, shortly after it had raised its first $100,000 which took a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>He compares to some recent meme coin presales including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/buy-love-hate-inu-token.htm">Love Hate Inu</a> (LHINU) which pumped on exchanges by several fold before a correction. </p>
<p><iframe title="Wall Street Meme Presale Is Now LIVE! HUGE POTENTIAL" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S7N3gKLcmCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Like Wall Street Memes, LHINU had price stages, but a larger range &#8211; from $0.000085 at stage one to a listing price of $0.000145, a 70.5% difference &#8211; and went on trade as high as $0.000365 on OKX, an over 400% increase.</p>
<p>That ROI is modest compared to some more recent meme coin ICOs like RefundCoin (RFD), which rose by thousands of percent thanks to being backed by an NFT and crypto whale blurr.eth.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/refundcoin-price-pumps-1000-percent-meme-tokens-still-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-now.htm"><u>We reviewed RFD</u></a> two days after its launch, which then went on to double again from the over 10,000% gains in the chart below.</p>

<h2>WSM Token Price Forecast for Future Years</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Much of the early Wall Street Memes price action may take place in 2024 if the presale sells out shortly before the end of 2023.</p>
<p>While volatile and high risk, often having a post-ICO dump, many crypto experts have stated meme coins rank among the easiest ways to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-make-money-with-cryptocurrency.htm">make money with cryptocurrency</a> as they are an inefficient market. They can do what other crypto assets cannot &#8211; make exponential gains in a matter of days, as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe (PEPE) most famously showed &#8211; alongside Floki Inu, Wojak, Turbo and many more.</p>
<p>Earlier this year for example <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1648137350059311105"><u>Altcoin Sherpa</u></a> tweeted a thread to his 195k followers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re kind of the original NFT in a lot of ways. Meme coins are built around a simple idea that&#8217;s easy for people to understand (ie. a Dog). You don&#8217;t need a big brain to understand it and you don&#8217;t need to go through complicated steps to work with it (ie. DeFi). We all want to get rich and to get rich fast. What better way than to do it with meme coins?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While he cautioned that some meme tokens are scams, rugpulls, or just have low utility, he stated they can have &#8216;500x&#8217; upside potential or more. </p>
<p>They can then retrace by 90% or deeper &#8211; making investing early the best bet, at the pre-ICO, IDO or IEO stage, during pre-sale rounds if they are open to the public.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/114499/276490/pepe-price-chart.jpg" alt="Pepe Price Chart" /></figure>
<p>The Pepe price for example corrected 80% after an explosive bull run far beyond what GameStop stocks achieved, making many holders millionaires. Even the Ethereum price at one point retraced 95% (from $1,440 to $80) before setting new all-time highs.</p>
<p>The most upside potential tends to be realized by following the trading mantra of <i>buy low, sell high</i>, and sticking to well-established projects with a trusted team.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes draws on their experience of launching successful NFT projects &#8211; that did not scam investors and are still around today. Wall St Bulls NFTs have 3,532 owners according to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls"><u>OpenSea</u></a>.</p>
<p>In 2022 <a href="https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1567221067625676802"><u>@MacnBTC</u></a> tweeted to his 414k followers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Someone with a $10,000 portfolio should not focus on buying $ETH and $BTC but rather possibly aim to get whitelisted in NFT projects and gamble on dogecoins that either go x50 or -100%.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His sentiment is similar &#8211; that DOGE themed cryptos, or meme tokens in general can have 50x potential and can also fail completely. That averages out to a high profit potential, as long you adopt a risk management strategy &#8211; e.g. keeping a diversified portfolio and not over-investing in one crypto project.</p>
<p>See our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>list of crypto presales</u></a> for some other options to invest in early. We rank the Wall Street Memes presale our top pick currently for being on its earliest stages and history in the NFT and meme space.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wall Street Meme NEW 10X CRYPTO PRESALE - Next Crypto to Explode? $WSM 100x Crypto Gem &#x1f525;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2DTEOjOVxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes tokenomics are highlighted in the video above, with 100% available to the community &#8211; including 50% sold during the WSM presale, 30% for future community rewards and 20% for CEX and DEX liquidity. </p>
<p>There not being any team tokens set aside can guard against an issue a similar project faced &#8211; Wall Street Baby (WSB). After claiming to be the official token of the Wall Street Bets Reddit, insiders on the $WSB project team dumped a large portion of the WSB token supply on the market, causing a 90% crash in the Wall Street Baby price.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Place To Buy Cryptos</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Although the Wall Street Memes token is not yet listed on Binance, it has high prospects for a potential listing due to its popularity among investors.</p>
<p>Binance offers many cryptos for trading, providing users access to popular and emerging digital assets. The platform caters to beginners and experienced traders by offering basic and advanced trading interfaces, including spot, margin, and futures trading.</p>
<p>The platform also focuses on security, using reliable practices such as two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage of assets, and an insurance fund to protect user funds.</p>
<p>User-Friendly Mobile Application: The Binance mobile app is highly rated for its usability, allowing users to trade, manage their portfolios, and access other services.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="900" height="462" class="wp-image-136746 size-full aligncenter" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg" alt="Binance buy crypto" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto.jpg 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1701092944-binance-buy-crypto-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Binance&#8217;s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading platform allows users to buy and sell cryptos directly with each other, supporting multiple payment methods. This feature has particularly benefited regions with limited access to traditional banking services.</p>
<p>Binance is known for its competitive fee structure, charging a standard 0.1% for both makers and takers. This rate can be further reduced by using BNB to pay for fees or by attaining higher VIP levels based on trading volume.</p>
<p>Binance offers staking services, allowing users to earn rewards by holding certain cryptos. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) varies depending on the asset and the duration of staking, providing an additional income stream for investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance/" target="_blank"  class="button-more cta-btn" >Visit Binance</a>
<p><em>Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.</em></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>With a wide reach on social media that saw the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>wallstmemes.com</u></a> presale sell out its first stage within days with little media coverage in the crypto space, WSM could have high upside potential.</p>
<p>A conservative Wall Street Memes price prediction might be for WSM to test the $100 million market cap level, which recent new meme coin launches we reviewed such as Sponge and Tamadoge reached. In the most bullish case, Pepe still has a ~$600 million market cap even after its deep correction, and two meme coins rank in the top fifteen cryptocurrency assets &#8211; SHIB valued at $5 billion and DOGE in the top ten with a $10 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Having an established community leads to more holders rather than short term traders looking to take profit early and move onto the next asset. NFT investors also usually hold their digital assets for a longer period, and many of the Wall St Bulls NFT community may have formed the early investors into $WSM.</p>
<p>The project is also building up publicity with a $50,000 airdrop hosted on outreach platform <a href="https://gleam.io/xKLkf/wall-street-memes-50000-airdrop"><u>Gleam.io</u></a>, to be shared between five winners.</p>

<p>New crypto exchange listings often offer investors the possibility to get in early on the next cryptocurrency to pump.</p>
<p>During this guide, we’ll be taking a look at 16 crypto projects that could be the next new coin listing to pump and providing a step-by-step guide detailing how to prepare for and buy a new exchange listing.</p>
<h2>Best New Coin Listing for 2023 &#8211; Top List</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Each of the projects we’ve included have huge upside potential and could be the most promising new coin listing set to pump in 2023:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken"><strong>Bitcoin ETF Token</strong></a> &#8211; The platform is closely tied to the anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF market.

<h3><strong>1. Bitcoin ETF Token &#8211; Trending New Token With Deflationary Mechanics And Token Burns For Long Term Growth</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/btcetftoken">Bitcoin ETF Token</a> ($BTCETF) is a hot new crypto, especially for those interested in the evolving dynamics of Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). </p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not directly affiliated with any Bitcoin spot ETFs, its growth and tokenomics are closely tied to the significant developments within the Bitcoin ETF market.</p>
<p>The $BTCETF is in its presale phase, with a total supply of 2.1 billion tokens. The presale is structured in ten stages, with the token price initially set at $0.005 and set to rise to $0.0068 by the final round. </p>
<p>This progressive pricing strategy offers a potential 36% price increase, providing an early investment incentive. The project has already shown remarkable traction, raising nearly $700K in under 10 days, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in its potential.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131045 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token Presale" width="900" height="468" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964365-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-31-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>A defining characteristic of Bitcoin ETF Token is its deflationary model. The project commits to burning 5% of its total token supply at various Bitcoin-related milestones, with 25% of the supply to be eliminated. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://btcetftoken.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin ETF Token whitepaper</a>, these milestones include significant events like $BTCETF achieving a $100 million market capitalization, the launch and confirmation of a Bitcoin spot ETF, and Bitcoin&#8217;s price exceeding $100,000.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a 5% tax on trading transactions is set to decrease by 1% with each milestone achieved, aligning with the token&#8217;s life cycle and market progress.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131046 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF Token - Staking" width="900" height="463" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23.png 900w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-300x154.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1699964398-screenshot-2023-11-14-at-5-08-23-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>For early stakers, $BTCETF offers an appealing APY of over 300%, though this rate is expected to decrease as more tokens are staked and more investors participate. </p>
<p>Over 75 million tokens have already been staked, showing high community involvement and trust in the token&#8217;s future. </p>
<p>Investors can purchase $BTCETF tokens through the Bitcoin ETF Token website by connecting their Ethereum wallet and using ETH, USDT, or card for transactions. </p>
<p>While purchases with MATIC and BNB are possible, they are not eligible for staking rewards. Interested users can join the <a href="https://t.me/BTCETF_Token">Bitcoin ETF Token Telegram channel</a> to stay updated on the latest developments and engage with other community members.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Bitcoin Minetrix &#8211; Revolutionary Stake-to-Mine Crypto Tokenizing Cloud Mining, Raised Over $3.1 Million</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-minetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> ($BTCMTX) is a new coin listing that is taking the market by storm. The $BTCMTX presale has raised over $3.1 million in only a little over a month. </p>
<p>The $BTCMTX token has a total supply of 4 billion &#8211; 70% of which (2.8 billion tokens) will be allocated across thirty-nine stages. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/333357/bitcoin-minetrix-img.jpg" alt="bitcoin minetrix presale graphic" /></figure>
<p>Through the current round, $BTCMTX is priced at only $0.0114 per token. This will rise progressively by 2.5% at each stage of the 39 stage presale.</p>
<p>The presale’s popularity is due to the unique use case that $BTCMTX offers. Token holders can stake their holdings on Bitcoin Minetrix’s Ethereum-powered smart contract to earn cloud mining credits. This is the first platform that is decentralizing the cloud mining space. </p>
<p>Therefore, token holders have full autonomy over their holdings. Since the credits are recorded on a digital ledger, the platform also ensures security to individuals. These credits are ERC-20 tokens that cannot be traded. However, credit holders can burn their holdings to generate Bitcoin cloud mining power and access allocated mining times. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/333358/bitcoin-minetrix-cloud-mining.jpg" alt="bitcoin minetrix cloud mining solution" /></figure>
<p>Thus, one can potentially earn a percentage of Bitcoin mining fees with Bitcoin Minetrix. By the end of the presale rounds, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to raise a hard cap of $33.46 million. Investors can get started by purchasing a minimum of $10 through the presale website. </p>

<h3><b>3. Meme Kombat &#8211; Get Staking and Wagering Rewards with this New Meme Coin, Priced at $0.1667 on Presale </b></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/">Meme Kombat (MK)</a> is a meme cryptocurrency that is leveraging artificial intelligence to offer a virtual battle arena. On this arena, players can engage in battles by leveraging meme coin avatars. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-121742 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home.png" alt="Meme Kombat presale homepage" width="1439" height="669" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home.png 1439w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-1024x476.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-768x357.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698403799-meme-kombat-home-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 1439px) 100vw, 1439px" /></p>
<p>According to the Meme Kombat roadmap, the battle arenas will be released in different seasons &#8211; featuring new avatars and income-earning opportunities. The first season will be released after the Meme Kombat presale and will feature 11 unique meme coin avatars. </p>
<p>$MK, the native cryptocurrency, can be wagered on the battle arena to earn several rewards. For instance, you can select your meme coin avatar and challenge friends on the Player vs Player mode. To up the stakes, wager $MK tokens on the outcome of the battle, and earn extra if you are successful in battle. </p>
<p>Currently, $MK is priced at just $0.1667 during the ongoing presale. Tokens can be purchased with other cryptos such as Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT). After making the purchase, your tokens will get automatically staked on the ecosystem. For the course of the presale, Meme Kombat is offering staking APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) of 112%. </p>
<p>However, users must re-stake their holdings for one lock-up period to earn the APYs. The lock-up period is only 14 days. From a total supply of 120 million, 50% has been allocated for the ongoing presale. Meme Kombat aims to raise $10 million by the end of the presale. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/86635/331157/meme-kombat-tokenomics.jpg" alt="meme kombat tokenomics" /></p>
<p>So far, Meme Kombat has raised over $1.1M. Another 40% of the supply will be distributed through staking, battle, and community rewards. The remaining 10% will be allocated for the upcoming exchange listings. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Wall Street Memes &#8211; The New Meme Token for Staking with an APY of Up Over 60%, Raised More Than $25 Million In Presale</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>Wall Street Memes</u></a> (WSM) is a trending new crypto with community-centric principles and massive investor backing.</p>
<p>It is linked to the Wall St. Bulls NFT collection on Ethereum that sold out in 2021 within 30 minutes. The platform has a strong community following, exceeding one million across various social networks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/333353/wsm-popular-memes.jpg" alt="wall street memes social media accounts" /></figure>
<p>In May 2023, the brains behind Wall St. Bulls launched WSM, which has since made rapid progress through its presale.</p>
<p>Projects like Wall Street Memes, backed by a strong community, generally yield sustainable long-term gains. Moreover, WSM comes with a staking facility offering an annual percentage yield of over 60%. As per the latest data, staking participants can earn 75 WSM per block as incentives.</p>
<p>Notably, over 320 million WSM tokens have been staked on the platform, showing strong investor trust in the platform.</p>
<p>Also, Wall Street Memes caught the attention of influential figures like Elon Musk, who has engaged with the token&#8217;s Twitter account. </p>
<p>This growing attention likely paves the way for WSM&#8217;s listing on major crypto exchanges in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/90529/329657/screenshot-2023-09-12-at-.jpg" alt="wall street memes staking pool" /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf"><u>Wall Street Memes whitepaper</u></a> outlines that 50% of its 2 billion WSM tokens were set aside for initial sale. The remaining tokens are divided as 30% for community incentives and 20% to boost exchange liquidity.</p>
<p>This strategy aims to reduce the risks of market sell-offs stemming from team-owned tokens, an issue commonly observed in other meme cryptos.</p>

<h3><strong>6. yPredict &#8211; Earn Passive Income through this Cryptocurrency Platform </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/">yPredict</a> is a cryptocurrency analytics and research platform. The purpose of this ecosystem is to leverage AI technologies to offer predictive models on the outlook of certain digital currencies. The models are generated by AI developers, researchers, and financial quants, who distribute their predictions through a financial marketplace. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/274353/screen-shot-2023-05-09-at.jpg" alt="ypredict presale stage 4" /></figure>
<p>These models can be purchased as monthly subscriptions with $YPRED, the native cryptocurrency. After being listed at $0.0375 per token, this token recently conducted its presale. Currently, $YPRED is priced at $0.05 but will jump to $0.12 by the final round. </p>
<p>Within the ecosystem, AI trading signals are used to provide members with a detailed perspective on how the markets may perform next. yPredict uses 25+ charting patterns to determine whether a token is bullish or bearish. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the platform conducts real-time sentiment analysis of popular coins. By using more technical indicators, yPredict can give a proper insight into the future outlook of the cryptocurrency space. </p>
<p>While we cannot predict whether $YPRED will increase in value after its listing, the token can be staked on the ecosystem to generate passive income. Firstly, yPredict will introduce staking pools where 10% of all new subscription revenue will be sent to existing token holders. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/274354/ypredict-features.jpg" alt="ypredict trading features" /></figure>
<p>On these pools, 15% of all swapping fees will also be distributed. Thus, loyal community members will benefit as the platform expands. One can also access the play-to-earn hub on yPredict to make directional bets on the future position of the crypto space. The most accurate performers will be rewarded with tokens. </p>
<p>Through a Learn2Earn ecosystem, users can take assessments and earn tokens. The yPredict presale has already raised over $750K since launch.

<h3><strong>7. Tamadoge &#8211; Meme and P2E Project Expected to have Breakout 2023</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/tamadoge/en">Tamadoge</a> (TAMA) is a play-to-earn (P2E) meme coin with all the markings of the next crypto to pump. </p>
<p>This crypto project sold out its presale early due to high demand, raising 19 million USDT in under two months before reaching an all-time high of $0.194 after its initial exchange offering (IEO) on OKX.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/223246/tamadoge-king.jpg" alt="tamadoge meme graphic" /></figure>
<p>That represented a pump of nearly 2,000% from its early presale price and more than 550% from its listing price.</p>
<p>Investors are excited about the huge potential of the project which not only has a deflationary meme token but a play-to-earn game incorporating NFT ownership.</p>
<p>The P2E aspects of Tamadoge are based around a Metaverse world called the Tamaverse. Within this world, players raise Tamadoge pets using food, accessories, and toys from the in-game store. </p>
<p>As a pet levels up, its owner earns Dogepoints, increasing their leaderboard ranking and share of the rewards pool.</p>
<p>Tamadoge will have its sights set on <a href="https://www.safebettingsites.com/2022/01/14/alien-worlds-most-popular-nft-game-with-1-11m-monthly-users/">Alien Worlds</a>, which was the world’s leading NFT game earlier this year with 1.1 million monthly players.</p>
<p>The coin features strict tokenomics with a total supply of just 2 billion and a deflationary mechanism that will see 5% of tokens burned for every transaction in the pet store &#8211; the area where players can buy digital treats and toys for their pets to help them grow.</p>
<p>Compare that to meme coin rivals Dogecoin, which has an unlimited supply and a circulating supply of 130 billion, or Shiba Inu which has a supply of 550 trillion &#8211; 275,000 times that of TAMA.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221699/next-crypto-to-pump-tamadoge.jpg" alt="tamadoge chart graphic" /></figure>
<p>The 21,100 NFTs went on sale in October and the 100 Ultra Rare Pets &#8211; those with the best stats in the game &#8211; became the top trending collection on OpenSea after selling out for a combined 250 ETH</p>
<p>After its hugely successful listing on OKX, Tamadoge is next set for a listing on Gate.io &#8211; the fifth-largest exchange by volume &#8211; with more listings in the pipeline.</p>
<p>With its ecosystem continuing to be built and upcoming listings, Tamadoge remains a top <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-to-watch.htm">crypto to watch</a> in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>With Tamadoge providing investors a massive amount of utility, a clear roadmap, and consistent updates, it could be the next crypto to pump. Join the <a href="https://t.me/TamadogeOfficial">Tamadoge Telegram</a> to stay updated with the project’s developments. </p>

<h3><strong>8. Lucky Block &#8211; Exciting Crypto Casino and Sportsbook </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://luckyblock.com/">Lucky Block</a> (LBLOCK) started as a platform dedicated to hosting NFT-based competitions with massive prizes.</p>
<p>However, it become among the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">best crypto casino and sportsbooks,</a> offering more than 2,700 games &#8211; including slots and classics such as roulette and poker &#8211; and enticing welcome bonuses for new players.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221721/lucky-block-new-coin.jpg" alt="lucky block token features" /></figure>
<p>A range of tokens can be used &#8211; with LBLOCK soon to be added &#8211; sign-up is free, quick and easy (although some players will require a VPN) and new players get 15% cashback on losses. </p>
<p>Crypto payouts are rapid and provably fair, with a $1 minimum deposit and no limits or fees on deposits or withdrawals. </p>
<p>The price of LBLOCK token has pumped more than 70% since the casino went live.</p>
<p>Recently, the project has upgraded to support both the BEP20 and ERC20 token standard, which has enabled LBLOCK V2 to be listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Furthermore, this update has also removed the tax on LBLOCK transactions, eliminating the 12% fees to 0%, making it better for day trading than the V1 token.</p>
<p>The team also announced that the Ethereum bridge solution for moving between the Ethereum (V2) and BNB Smart Chain (V1) versions of the coin is now live, with holders able to claim 0.88 V2 tokens for every 1 V1 token.</p>
<p>LBLOCK also has a 1% rolling token burn on its circulating supply each month, another bullish catalyst that will drastically cut supply and increase value of LBLOCK. So far, LBLOCK V1 has been listed on PancakeSwap, with LBLOCK V2 being available to buy on LBANK, MEXC, and Gate.io.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Battle Infinity &#8211; Recent Coin Listing on LBank, Coin98, PancakeSwap</strong></h3>
<p>The Metaverse, P2E gaming, and DeFi are perhaps the hottest sectors in cryptocurrency and <a href="https://battleinfinity.io/">Battle Infinity</a> (IBAT) blends all three. </p>
<p>The project consists of six core platforms, each fulfilling a unique role in an interconnected ecosystem. There is a fantasy sports league, an NFT marketplace, a collection of player-vs-player P2E games, a Metaverse arena, a decentralized exchange (DEX), and a staking platform.</p>
<p>By building a platform with a large number of features, Battle Infinity has cast its net wide to capture a massive user base. This strategy seems to have paid off with it hitting some impressive numbers during its presale and initial DEX offering.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221729/battle-infinity-coin-price-chart-poocoin.jpg" alt="battle infinity performance chart" /></figure>
<p>Battle Infinity has already proven to be a hit with investors, raising 16,500 BNB in just 25 days during its presale. Even after the presale concluded, the crypto pumped by around 400% during its first DEX listing on PancakeSwap and with more new exchange listings on the way, and Battle Infinity has been rated among the best <a href="https://www.business2community.com/cryptocurrency/best">long terms cryptos to invest in</a>.</p>
<p>Battle Infinity uses Binance’s BEP20 standard, boasts an engaged community, and has been attracting investors en masse. With those factors in mind, it seems likely that as more new CEX listings are announced, IBAT could be the next crypto pump.</p>
<p>So far IBAT has been listed on Coin98 and LBank with more new crypto exchange listing announcements rumored to be in the works. IBAT token is currently still trading over 100% higher than its presale price of $0.0015, despite the 2022 crypto bear market.</p>

<p>Adshares (ADS) is a project aiming to reshape advertising through the use of blockchain technology. By simplifying decentralization, Adshares hopes to partner with high-profile advertisers before anyone else. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221947/adshares-coin.jpg" alt="adshares homepage" /></figure>
<p>The project will also enable creators to monetize platforms within cryptocurrency (e.g. the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-the-metaverse.htm">Metaverse</a>, crypto games, etc).</p>
<h3><strong>11. LooksRare &#8211; Token From Popular NFT Marketplace</strong></h3>
<p>LooksRare is a community-driven NFT marketplace dedicated to hosting the <a href="https://insidebitcoins.com/buy-cryptocurrency/buy-nft">best NFTs</a> in the industry. The LooksRare (LOOKS) cryptocurrency was created to reward users for shaping the platform. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221949/looksrare.jpg" alt="looksrare nft marketplace" /></figure>
<p>In contrast to almost every other crypto project, LooksRare gives 100% of the platform&#8217;s transaction fees back to users. </p>
<h3><strong>12. Efinity Token &#8211; Promising Project From the Enjin Team</strong></h3>
<p>Efinity (EFI) is a new platform created by the Enjin team. The project was built as a Polkadot-based NFT platform. Similar to Enjin, it was created to enable gamers and developers to buy, sell, create, and trade tokenized game items. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221951/efinity-coin.jpg" alt="efinity token homepage" /></figure>
<p>The project uses Polkadot’s parachain technology to operate on the DOT blockchain.</p>
<p>We also reviewed Enjin (ENJ) on our list of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-metaverse-coins.htm">best metaverse coins</a>, which includes several new coin listings on major centralized crypto exchanges.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Kromatika &#8211; Upcoming Decentralized Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>Kromatika (KROM) is an innovative new DEX aggregation platform designed to provide investors with reduced slippage and the best possible value. </p>
<p>As it stands, different DEXs often feature different prices and slippage rates, making the process of buying crypto quite troublesome. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221952/kromatika-coin-listing.jpg" alt="kromatika homepage" /></figure>
<p>By bundling different DEXs into a single platform Kromatika aims to eliminate that issue.</p>
<p>As well as having its own native token KROM, many new coin listings will take place on the Kromatika platform itself and initial DEX offerings (IDOs) can often outperform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-icos.htm">initial coin offerings</a> (ICOS) on CEXs.</p>
<h3><strong>14. CarboFoot &#8211; Rewarding Users for Reducing their Carbon Footprint</strong></h3>
<p>CarboFoot (CFOOT) is a project capitalizing on the current move-to-earn trend and could be the next crypto to pump as it&#8217;s also an eco friendly token, something many cryptocurrency investors are interested in.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221958/carbofoot-coin.jpg" alt="carbofoot homepage" /></figure>
<p>The project aims to reward uses for cycling and overall reducing their carbon footprint. Users can earn crypto through gamified recycling, tree planting, cycling, and more. Another popular crypto project designed to make carbon credits more accessible to retail investors is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-stos.htm">best crypto STO</a> IMPT.

<h3><strong>15. Beefy Finance &#8211; Decentralized Yield Optimizer</strong></h3>
<p>Beefy Finance (BIFI) is a platform offering multi-chain yield optimization. It enables users to stake crypto-assets built on a multitude of networks (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, etc) on a single platform. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221965/beefy-crypto.jpg" alt="beefy finance homepage" /></figure>
<p>Furthermore, Beefy Finance automatically optimizes yields to provide investors with the best possible returns. </p>
<p>BIFI is still a relatively <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-low-cap-crypto.htm">low cap crypto</a> asset with a market capitalization of just under $25 million according to CoinMarketCap data. 90% of its total supply is also unlocked and in circulation, which can help an asset be the next crypto to pump, especially as each new coin listing increases the number of buyers competing for that circulating supply.</p>
<h3><strong>16. Digipad &#8211; Making Investing Safer</strong></h3>
<p>Digipad (DGP) is a BEP-based project aiming to create a safer ecosystem for crypto investors. The project provides investors with an all-in-one platform to launch and invest in initial coin offerings. </p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/news/88264/221972/digipad-coin.jpg" alt="digipad homepage" /></figure>
<p>Furthermore, Digipad features a proprietary DEX called Digiswap and a dedicated staking platform.</p>
<p>After a long pull back and correction DGP is now a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-penny-crypto.htm">penny cryptocurrency</a>, price at around two cents. Following its deep retracement it could be the next crypto to pump if a new exchange listing is announced.</p>
<h2>How to Buy a New Coin Listing &#8211; Factors to Consider</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-kraken-listings.htm">next Kraken listing</a>, or the top trending crypto to list on the market&#8217;s most popular DEX, finding new coin listings can be time consuming. </p>
<p>Below are some ways to invest in a new coin listing and considerations to be aware of to do so safely:</p>
<h3>Invest Early at Presale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>Early investors can prepare for a new coin listing even before it happens, at the presale phase. This way, users can purchase the token before it is available to the public. </strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sites like CoinMarketCap, CoinList, and CoinGecko will provide lists of new projects, but it is vital investors due thorough research and due diligence before investing in a project.</p>
<p>If selecting a currently active presale, look for projects with doxxed team members (meaning they are public rather than anonymous), third-party auditing (on sites like Solid Proof, Solidity Finance, CoinSniper and others) and get a second opinion on online forums like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-reddit.htm">Reddit crypto</a> subs.</p>
<p>Red flags to look out for are poorly put-together websites and roadmaps, anonymous teams, and low engagement on social media.</p>
<h3>Join a Project&#8217;s Social Channels</h3>
<p>To get notified of a new coin listing date and location &#8211; i.e. which crypto exchange &#8211; first join that crypto project&#8217;s social media community, if you have a specific token in mind.</p>
<p>That might include their Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, etc. </p>
<p>Remember that as a general policy admins and moderators do not direct message (DM) followers first. Unsolicited DMs are often a scam attempt &#8211; don&#8217;t communicate one on one.</p>
<p>Never give anyone online your seed phrase, or respond to requests to &#8216;validate your crypto wallet&#8217;. Beware of phishing links, and impersonators who copy the profile picture and user name of crypto project team members, or hack their social accounts.</p>
<h3>Monitor Crypto Market Trends</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i><strong>Coins rumored to be the next Binance listing, next Coinbase listing etc. or a smaller new coin listing often become the most searched crypto assets across social media.</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experienced crypto traders and investors research Google Trends data &#8211; for example our third pick Battle Infinity was recently one of the <a href="https://augustafreepress.com/cryptocurrency/top-trending-cryptocurrency-now/">top trending cryptocurrency</a> assets in the UK and India.</p>
<p>Also see our guide on how to find and rank the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">best crypto to buy</a> in terms of utility, roadmap, tokenomics and more.</p>
<p>Another upcoming crypto that didn&#8217;t make our list is Pi coin. For more details on this new digital asset readers can explore our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pi-coin-price-prediction.htm">Pi coin price prediction</a> article as we dive into performance forecasts for the next seven years.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>A new coin listing offers even beginner traders a simple way to buy the next crypto to pump, as new crypto exchanges increase the trading volume of a token, raise hype and boost the number of investors that can access a coin.</p>
<p>Our top pick for the best new coin listings is $BTCETF &#8211; the native cryptocurrency of Bitcoin ETF Token. By staking this cryptocurrency, investors can earn high staking rewards of over 300%. Currently priced at $0.0052 per token, $BTCETF will rise progressively at each stage to $0.0068.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><strong>What is a new coin listing?</strong></p>
<p>This term refers to the day-one launch of a new crypto coin on a centralized exchange (CEX) or decentralized exchange (DEX) platform, often resulting in it being the next crypto to pump on that day &#8211; although some assets can &#8216;pump and dump&#8217;, rising before the new coin listing in anticipation then retracing &#8211; the &#8216;buy the rumor, sell the news&#8217; effect.</p>
<p><strong>What is the next crypto to pump or new listing to take place?</strong></p>
<p>At the time of writing, the most talked about crypto token is Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF), a platform that has already raised more than $800K in just 10 days of presale launch. </p>
<p><strong>What are the risks of buying a new coin listing?</strong></p>
<p>While they have high potential upside, new coin listings are also risky &#8211; as crypto traders would say, they have high risk/reward. Often new Coinbase or Binance listings pump explosively then retrace by a high percentage. New coin listings are periods of high volatility in both directions &#8211; the larger the crypto exchange listing, the more volatile the listing will be. Don&#8217;t go &#8216;all in&#8217; on any one particular coin or one event such as a new coin listing &#8211; manage your risk.</p>

In this article we ask the question &#8211; is it possible to achieve millionaire status by buying just $50 worth of XRP?</p><h2>Is An XRP Price Range From $3,500 &#8211; $21,900 Realistic?&nbsp;</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Valhil Capital&#8217;s recent study indicates that the fair value of XRP would fall within the range of $3,500 and $21,900 per token at some point in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>This astronomical price is derived from results obtained through six different quantitative pricing models.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">16. To our knowledge, no other analysis of this scope has been done in the digital assets space. <br><br>A diverse team (w/a variety of professional backgrounds) came together as volunteers to build a series of quantitive models to understand the value drivers for a digital currency. <a href="https://t.co/XuDlNwPd2i">pic.twitter.com/XuDlNwPd2i</a></p>&mdash; Molly Elmore (@mollyelmore22) <a href="https://twitter.com/mollyelmore22/status/1666489144569126927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Currently, approximately 52 billion XRP tokens are in circulation. Taking the lower value of $3,500 per token, this would correspond to a market capitalization of $180 trillion.</p><p>By comparison, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, is only $1.05 trillion. To build a fortune of one million dollars at a price of $3,500 per token, as few as 286 XRP would be sufficient.</p><p>A Ripple price forecast of $3,500 or higher might seem unrealistic, even impossible unless in some hyperinflation type scenario &#8211; but the explosive study by Valhil Capital claims it to be possible if XRP assumes the position of a global currency and store of value.</p><h2>Can Ripple Beat the SEC?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Their investigation centred around assessing the impact of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. The &#8220;fair price&#8221; that Valhil Capital analysts estimate for XRP is the result of <a href="https://twitter.com/mollyelmore22/status/1666489120401547293"><u>two years of research</u></a>.</p><p>Since late 2020, Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency XRP, has been under pressure due to its legal dispute with the SEC. The charges include unregistered securities trading and insider trading.&nbsp;</p><p>A total of $1.3 billion is estimated to be at stake and the outcome set to determine the future of XRP. Should Ripple win the case, analysts speculate that the XRP price could experience a tremendous increase.</p><p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Messari CEO Ryan Selkis, and crypto lawyer John Deaton have all expressed optimism for a pro-XRP resolution to the lawsuit.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><!-- TradingView Widget BEGIN -->

Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies, were also initially traded for only a few cents or fractions of cents.&nbsp;</p><p>However, due to the flood of new cryptocurrencies (there are now more than 20,000 digital currencies or &#8216;altcoins&#8217; alongside BTC), it has become significantly more challenging to identify coins with significant potential.</p><p>A new type of cryptocurrency that has made these price explosions a reality in recent months and years is the emerging sector of &#8216;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm"><u>meme coins</u></a>&#8216;.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting with Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and most recently Pepe coin, what they all have in common is that they do not offer any real value and primarily rely on the community aspect to gain value.

The members of that Reddit forum famously decided, as small investors, to drive up the price of GameStop stock back in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>That caused shockwaves in the financial world, as many hedge funds had heavily bet on the stock&#8217;s price falling and lost billions as a result of the action of a few underdog traders.</p><p>Having previously launched a successful NFT project, the Wall St Bulls on OpenSea, news emerged that members of the meme stocks movement had decided to launch a meme coin of their own.
