<p>Bitcoin price briefly broke through the $42,000 mark earlier today, gaining 6.6% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>This surge marks a recovery to levels last witnessed before the Terra crash in May 2022.</p>
<p>Liquidations in the crypto market have concurrently spiked, with over $160 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, primarily affecting short positions.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price reached a peak of $42,100, and is currently trading at $41,603, following a slight decline subsequent to surpassing the $42,000 milestone.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Reaches Highest Level Since May 2022</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This surge represents a complete retracement to Bitcoin&#8217;s level above $41,000 in early May 2022, reflecting a remarkable value increase of over 150% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The global cryptocurrency market cap has also experienced a notable uptick, reaching $1.62 trillion, signifying a 4.0% increase within the past 24 hours. The last time the combined cryptocurrency market cap reached this level was in late April 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of trading volumes, November&#8217;s cryptocurrency exchange trading volume surpassed $826 billion, marking the highest monthly volume since March of the same year.</p>
<p>Onchain data reveals that <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin&#8217;s daily trading volume</a> has increased from over $30 billion on December 1 to the current value of $32 billion, reaching a yearly high and its highest level since November 2022.</p>
<p>The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price has not been without consequences, as evidenced by significant liquidations in the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2>$216 Million Liquidated</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">Coinglass data</a> indicates that 75,887 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations exceeding $216 million. The majority of these liquidations targeted short positions, with $166 million shorts wiped out compared to just over $50 million in long positions.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin takes the spotlight, other blue-chip cryptocurrencies experienced varying gains on Monday. Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">ETH</a>) rose by over 4% to maintain its position above the $2,250 mark. BNB posted a more modest uptick of over 2%, reaching a current price of $234, while Solana traded flat, hovering around the $63.50 mark over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price has surged past the $40,000 mark for the first time since early May 2022.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price had been hovering around the $40,000 level in recent days and finally breached it on late Sunday, trading above $40,750 as of the latest update, reflecting a 24-hour rise of nearly 4%.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is up nearly 10% in the last 7 days, as per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Coingecko data</a>.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Surpasses $2,200 Mark</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Simultaneously, the second largest crypto Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">ETH</a>) lso experienced a positive trajectory, surpassing $2,200 amid the overall market rally.</p>
<p>Ethereum was observed to be trading at $2,205, showcasing a similar percentage rise over the past 24 hours. While most other top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization marked smaller gains, BNB coin, affiliated with the Binance exchange, exhibited a slight decline of about 0.1% over the past day.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent climb follows its dip below $40,000 in April 2022. However, the largest crypto by market cap has been on an upward trend over the past few months, driven in part by what seems to be dovish remarks from U.S. central bankers and optimistic expectations regarding the potential approval of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-attract-3b-on-first-day-and-up-to-55b-over-five-years-analysts.htm">spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) in the country.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ethereum, having not traded above $2,200 since May 2022, has approached this threshold several times in recent weeks. A notable trend in Bitcoin transactions has been the withdrawal of 37,000 BTC by holders between Nov. 17 and Dec. 1, suggesting a preference for direct custody of their coins.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Rallies 120% in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin price has experienced a remarkable rally of over 120% throughout the year, with optimism prevailing among industry experts for this surge to extend into 2024.</p>
<p>Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, emphasized this sentiment, stating that 2023 appeared to be a preparatory year for the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/bitcoin-price-at-100000-in-2024-crypto-execs-say-bull-run-has-begun.html">anticipated bull run in 2024</a> and beyond.</p>
<p>However, the cryptocurrency landscape has faced its share of challenges since Bitcoin&#8217;s last record high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.</p>
<p>Issues ranging from project collapses and bankruptcies to criminal trials have marked the industry. Recently, high-profile cases involving FTX and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Binance</a> have reached resolutions, with industry observers perceiving these conclusions as a potential turning point in addressing long standing challenges within the crypto market.</p>

<h2>The Venture is Fully Funded by DOGE Tokens</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The brainchild of the space technology company Geometric Energy Corporation, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doge-1-mission-set-for-november-but-doge-slips-behind-rampant-qube.htm">DOGE-1 satellite project</a> was unveiled in May 2021 and is set to be launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>This satellite venture marks the first-ever launch fully funded in DOGE tokens.</p>
<p>Miniature screens on the satellite are poised to display a variety of content, including advertisements, images, and logos, which will be transmitted back to Earth.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after a series of delays that have beset the DOGE-1 mission.</p>
<p>Initially revealed by SpaceX founder Elon Musk in 2021 as part of a rideshare collaboration with Intuitive Machines and NASA, the mission faced repeated postponements from its initially targeted 2022 launch to the now-scheduled January 2024 liftoff.</p>
<h2>DOGE-Satellite Will Launch in January 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The DOGE-1 satellite&#8217;s unique feature of accepting DOGE tokens as payment aligns with the cryptocurrency&#8217;s growing acceptance in various spheres. This mission is not only a symbol of innovation but also a testament to the expanding influence of cryptocurrencies beyond traditional financial landscapes.</p>
<p>The DOGE-1 mission is not the only dogecoin-related venture in the pipeline. Another mission is reportedly in the works, indicating a growing interest in leveraging cryptocurrency for space exploration initiatives. The historic launch is scheduled for January 2024.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the leading meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin is trading at $0.084875, an increase of 4% in the last 24 hrs, as per Coingecko data.</p>

<p>Beosin EagleEye&#8217;s latest report exposes a <a href="https://beosin.com/resources/blockchain-security-recap-of-november-35653m-lost-in-attacks?lang=en-US">massive surge in blockchain security incidents</a> during November 2023, leading to a staggering total loss of over $356 million.</p>
<p>This marked an alarming 6.9-fold increase compared to the losses reported in October.</p>
<h2>Hacker Attacks Resulted in $335 Million Loss Alone</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hacker attacks took the lion&#8217;s share of the losses, accounting for approximately $335.63 million. The two high-profile incidents involving stolen funds exceeding $100 million each shook the industry.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/poloniex-to-resume-withdrawals-starting-with-trx-after-100m-hack.htm">Poloniex fell victim to a hack</a> of approximately $126 million, while HTX, along with its affiliated cross-chain bridge HECO Bridge, suffered a theft of approximately $110 million.</p>
<p>Remarkably, these two incidents, both affiliated with Sun Yuchen, constituted a significant 66% of the total losses attributed to hacker attacks in November.</p>
<p>Phishing scams also witnessed a surge, with individual addresses falling prey to schemes exceeding $1 million.</p>
<p>The global cryptocurrency landscape experienced a spike in crime cases involving amounts exceeding $100 million, encompassing various forms of fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>Exchanges, both centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX), bore the brunt of security incidents in November, with a combined loss of $215 million.</p>
<p>Poloniex, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heco-chain-htx-hit-by-100m-hack-justin-sun-says-exchange-will-cover-all-losses.htm">HTX</a>, CoinSpot, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dydx-dex-and-yfi-token-hit-by-9-million-targeted-attack-heres-what-happened.htm">dYdX</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">KyberSwap</a> were among the affected platforms.</p>
<p>The report issues a stern recommendation for major projects to fortify private key management, conduct routine security audits, establish emergency response plans, and intensify security awareness training for privileged employees.</p>
<h2>Phishing Scams and Rug Pulls Witness an Uptick</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The phishing scam landscape, witnessing an uptick in incidents, prompts user advisories to securely store private keys, exercise caution during signing procedures, and avoid engagement with suspicious content.</p>
<p>On the regulatory front, the US Treasury Department took action against cryptocurrency mixing platform Sinbad.</p>
<p>Allegations linked the platform to North Korean hackers, accusing Sinbad of handling funds from Horizon Bridge and Axie Infinity hacking incidents.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-treasury-sanctions-north-korean-governments-crypto-mixer-sinbad.htm">Sinbad faces sanctions</a> for purported involvement in activities such as evading sanctions, drug trafficking, purchasing materials for child sexual abuse, and participating in illegal sales on the dark web market.</p>

<p>Analysts are now eyeing a potential window for the approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), setting the time frame between January 5 and 10, 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-to-decide-on-two-spot-bitcoin-etfs-by-nov-17.htm">Previous deadline of November 17</a> by analysts passed without any discernible action from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>Deadline for Hashdex and Franklin Templeton ETF Around Jan 5 &#8211; 8</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
James Seyffart, an ETF specialist from Bloomberg Intelligence, shed light on this updated timeline, pinpointing the deadline for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-grayscale-ether-etf.htm">Hashdex and Franklin Templeton</a> around January 5-8.</p>
<p>This aligns with the broader window of January 5-10, where approval for all twelve spot BTC ETF filings could potentially materialize.</p>
<p>This revised timeline quashes any lingering hopes for a December approval, with recent SEC developments pushing the odds to the year 2024.</p>
<p>Seyffart and colleague Eric Balchunas maintain their prediction of a 90% likelihood of approval by January 10.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Financial Advisors Waiting to Provide BTC Access to Clients</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Financial advisors, eagerly anticipating Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, are poised to provide access to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">BTC</a> for their clients. Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services, a $250 billion asset management firm, underscores the significance of ETF approvals for financial advisors.</p>
<p>Edelman predicts a surge in interest, citing that 12% of advisors currently recommend Bitcoin, while 47% own the asset.</p>
<p>Edelman emphasized the importance of Bitcoin ownership among advisors for credibility.</p>
<p>He notes that advisors often grapple with the conflict of owning Bitcoin while not recommending it to clients, presenting a potential challenge.</p>
<p>Among the 47% of advisors who own BTC, many are eagerly awaiting the availability of spot BTC ETFs, anticipating compliance department approvals for this innovative investment product.</p>
<p>In a recent memo, the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2021-90/srnysearca202190-305159-785022.pdf">US SEC disclosed that it engaged in discussions with Grayscale</a> on Thursday regarding the prospective transformation of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.</p>
<p>The regulator body had initially opposed this transition, but Grayscale contested the decision in a legal battle, ultimately emerging victorious.</p>

<p>The RARI Foundation, the nonprofit entity linked to the Rarible ecosystem, has officially launched the testnet for the <a href="https://rarichain.org/">RARI Chain</a> on Arbitrum.</p>
<p>This novel EVM-equivalent blockchain is designed to serve as a nonfungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a>) infrastructure solution, embedding royalties directly into its nodes.</p>
<h2>Rarible Witnesses Massive Surge in Trading Volume</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The recent surge in Rarible&#8217;s trading volume acted as a catalyst for this initiative. Following a 585% uptick in the 24-hour trading volume on Rarible, the platform decided to exclude marketplaces lacking royalty support. This commitment to royalty enforcement and support evidently struck a chord with the community, setting the stage for the unveiling of the RARI Chain.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with CryptoNews, Jana Bertram, the Head of Strategy at RARI Foundation, emphasized the pivotal role of creators in propelling the NFT landscape forward. Bertram highlighted the importance of providing creators with robust tools and environments that contribute to their success, ultimately preventing their disintermediation from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3</a> growth.</p>
<p>Alex Salnikov, Co-founder of Rarible, echoed these sentiments, underlining the belief in a &#8220;creator-centric ecosystem&#8221; for Web3. The introduction of the RARI Chain, with royalties embedded at the node level, is positioned as a safeguard for creators&#8217; earnings. Salnikov emphasized that this approach transforms creator royalties from a mere promise into a tangible guarantee.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum, LayerZero, WalletConnect Support Rari Chain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The partnership ecosystem supporting the RARI Chain includes key players such as Arbitrum, LayerZero, Thirdweb, Gelato, WalletConnect, Magic, and Caldera, all actively contributing to the success of this new blockchain.</p>
<p>Nina Rong, the Head of Ecosystem Development at Arbitrum Foundation, stressed the significance of fairly rewarding creators for their efforts. Royalty enforcement at the node level, as facilitated by the RARI Chain, marks a substantial step in realizing this vision.</p>
<p>Founded in the year 2022, the RARI Foundation is a non-profit entity fulfilling the role of the authorized representative for the RARI DAO. Operating under the decentralized governance of $RARI token holders within an autonomous organization, the RARI DAO delegates pivotal responsibilities to the RARI Foundation.</p>

<p>Indian authorities are intensifying efforts to bring the alleged mastermind behind a massive $240 million cryptocurrency scam back to the country.</p>
<p>The special investigation team (SIT) of the Himachal police, after nearly two months of probing, has prepared a comprehensive 2,100-page chargesheet, unveiling the intricate details of the 2,000 INR crypto scam (approximately $240 million).</p>
<h2>Main Suspect in Crypto Scam Fled to Dubai</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The key figure identified as Subhash Chand, believed to be the mastermind, is currently on the run and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mastermind-behind-indias-24-million-crypto-fraud-flees-country.htm">suspected to be hiding in Dubai</a>.</p>
<p>The SIT has initiated the extradition process, with a hearing scheduled in a UAE court on December 4. Reports suggest that Subhash&#8217;s visa is also nearing expiration, adding urgency to the extradition plea, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachalcrypto-scam-probe-finds-funds-came-back-to-india-through-hawala-network-101701283422771.html">local media reported</a>.</p>
<p>The chargesheet, submitted to the prosecution department for sanction, names Hemraj, Sukhdev, and Abhishek as the main accused.</p>
<p>The investigation has unraveled a sophisticated network, exposing that the proceeds from the fraudulent transactions were funneled back to India through the hawala network.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency scam, initially estimated at ₹400 crore ($20 million) in 2018, has expanded to a staggering ₹2,000 crore across multiple states.</p>
<p>The police investigation discovered ove 250,000 identities created in Himachal alone by the scam artists, with government employees, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-1000-police-personnel-duped-in-240-million-crypto-scam-in-india.htm">police personnel</a>, and businessmen falling victim to the Ponzi investment scheme. Some government officials allegedly opted for voluntary retirement as a result.</p>
<h2>19 Arrested Linked to Massive Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Assets worth ₹19 crore ($2.2 million) belonging to eight accused have been seized by the special investigation team, which has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/one-arrested-in-alleged-240-million-crypto-scam-in-india.htm">made 19 arrests so far</a>.</p>
<p>The accused, who amassed wealth across various locations, including Mandi, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Punjab, Delhi, and Chandigarh, face charges of defrauding individuals in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana.</p>
<p>As the extradition plea unfolds, the state police, with the assistance of central investigating agencies, aim to secure a warrant against Subhash in the UAE court.</p>

<p>Switzerland-based Pando Asset has emerged as the latest contender in the race to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.</p>
<p>Joining dozens of other applicants, Pando Asset is seeking to introduce a fund type that has yet to receive approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>Swiss Firm Proposes Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pando Asset revealed its intentions through a Wednesday filing, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2001771/000182912623007712/pandoasset_s1.htm">proposing the creation of the Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust</a>.</p>
<p>The trust&#8217;s assets would predominantly comprise bitcoin, held under the custody of Coinbase Custody Trust company, with the trust administration duties entrusted to BNY Mellon.</p>
<p>Despite numerous inquiries, a spokesperson for Pando Asset remained silent, offering no immediate comments on the matter.</p>
<p>The SEC finds itself at the epicenter of a substantial influx of filings, with approximately a dozen issuers, including financial heavyweights <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fidelity-submits-revised-application-for-bitcoin-etf-amid-increasing-confidence-regarding-approval.htm">Fidelity</a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-race-intensifies-as-wisdomtree-invesco-both-file-submissions-within-24-hours-joining-blackrock.htm">Invesco</a>, presenting live spot Bitcoin ETF applications.</p>
<p>This surge in interest marks a pivotal moment for the SEC, as it navigates uncharted territory in considering approvals for such investment vehicles.</p>
<h2>Spto Crypto ETFs Internationally</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Internationally, regulators in Canada, Brazil, and the Netherlands have already given their nod to spot crypto ETFs in recent years. Meanwhile, crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), financial instruments collateralized by underlying exposures like bitcoin, have enjoyed a longer history in the market.</p>
<p>Pando Asset, with a suite of three exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the SIX Swiss Exchange, aims to leverage its European crypto product expertise in the US. Notably, one of its ETPs allocates to six diverse crypto assets, including bitcoin, ether, binance coin, cardano, solana, and polkadot.</p>
<p>The SEC is anticipated to deliver its ruling on the proposed Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF by January 10. Industry pundits speculate that this could open the floodgates, with a potential green light for multiple such products.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have even given a compelling <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brief-approval-window-opens-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-90-chance-of-approval-by-january.htm">90% likelihood of such approval</a>, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency investment opportunities in the US.</p>

<p>This narratives of the exceptional individuals featured in the list will be permanently recorded on the blockchain, marking a significant foray into the intersection of traditional media and web3.</p>
<h2>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Among Judges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The &#8220;Under 30&#8221; list spans across 20 diverse categories, including art, entertainment, retail and e-commerce, finance, and investment.</p>
<p>The judges for the &#8220;30 Under 30 Finance 2024&#8221; list comprise influential figures such as Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, and Web3 practitioners like Injective Labs founders Eric Chen and Albert Chon, and Fractal co-founder and co-CEO Aya Kantorovich, among others.</p>
<p>Forbes, recognized for spotlighting the brightest young entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders, is leveraging the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> blockchain to immortalize its data.</p>
<p>The move aligns with Forbes&#8217; commitment to marrying traditional media with cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>Vadim Supitskiy, Forbes&#8217; Chief Digital and Information Officer, emphasized the significance of this step, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By launching the Under 30 list on the Ethereum blockchain, we&#8217;re not just recognizing the influential young leaders; we&#8217;re also demonstrating the vast, untapped potential of blockchain technology in the realm of data storage and security.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The blockchain-enabled &#8220;Under 30&#8221; list is positioned as just the beginning of Forbes&#8217; foray into blockchain technology, showcasing its commitment to innovation and foresight in the dynamic digital landscape.</p>
<p>Taha Ahmed, Forbes&#8217; Chief Growth Officer, echoed this sentiment, expressing excitement about further exploration of how blockchain and Web3 technologies can transform the way important information is shared, stored, and secured.</p>

<p>The financial world bids farewell to Charlie Munger, the distinguished investor and long-time collaborator of Warren Buffett, who <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/28/investing/charlie-munger-dies/index.html">passed away at the age of 99</a> on November 28.</p>
<p>Munger&#8217;s demise marks the end of an era, leaving behind a legacy of impactful contributions to the investment landscape, notably during his tenure at Berkshire Hathaway alongside Buffett.</p>
<h2>Munger Wanted to Ban Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Munger&#8217;s financial prowess earned him accolades, he was equally <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/charlie-munger-expresses-concern-over-bitcoin-rise.htm">known for his opposition to Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>His critical stance on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> was evident in his public statements, branding the digital currency as &#8220;disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Munger&#8217;s skepticism was rooted in Bitcoin&#8217;s notorious volatility and the absence of regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>Of particular concern to Munger was Bitcoin&#8217;s potential misuse in criminal activities, including kidnapping and extortion.</p>
<p>He vocally <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">advocated for a U.S. ban on cryptocurrencies</a>, citing their unregulated and predatory nature.</p>
<p>In a candid interview, Munger expressed his reservations about a currency that could be exploited by criminals, stating, &#8220;I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite acknowledging Bitcoin&#8217;s rise, Munger begrudgingly referred to it as an &#8220;artificial substitute for gold,&#8221; comparing it to an unattainable pursuit. Even in the face of Bitcoin&#8217;s success, he maintained a critical perspective, stating during a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, &#8220;Of course, I hate the Bitcoin success.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passing of Charlie Munger marks a significant moment in financial history, triggering reflections on his outspoken views that have fueled extensive discussions within the financial sector.</p>

<p>The beleaguered crypto lender Genesis and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), have reached a settlement that could end the protracted lawsuit aimed at recovering $620 million in repayments from DCG.</p>
<h2>DCG Commits to Settling $324.5M in Loans by April</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to a <a href="/Users/DELL/Downloads/a660ddee-623f-4f43-aac9-0117a5310bd6.pdf">filing made on November 28</a> to a New York Bankruptcy Court, Genesis outlined the terms of the agreement, revealing that DCG has committed to settling its outstanding $324.5 million in loans by April of the coming year.</p>
<p>The settlement allows Genesis the option to pursue any unpaid amounts.</p>
<p>This proposed settlement emerges as a strategic move by Genesis to bring a conclusion to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-sues-parent-firm-dcg-over-600-million-loan-repayment.htm">lawsuit initiated against DCG</a> back in September.</p>
<p>The legal action sought to compel DCG to repay loans that had become overdue, totaling around $620 million. While DCG has made partial payments since the initiation of the lawsuit, this comprehensive settlement is expected to offer Genesis immediate, substantial, and near-term benefits.</p>
<p>More importantly, it is anticipated to circumvent the potential risks, expenses, and diversion of resources associated with protracted litigation.</p>
<h2>The Proposed Plan Will be Subject to a Vote</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The repayment agreement is a crucial component of Genesis&#8217; broader strategy to address its outstanding financial obligations to creditors. The proposed plan will be subject to a vote by these creditors before it is submitted to bankruptcy judge Sean Lean for a final decision.</p>
<p>Judge Lean will carefully consider the creditors&#8217; votes in determining the viability and fairness of the proposed plan.</p>
<p>In a related legal move, Genesis recently filed a lawsuit against crypto exchange Gemini on November 22, seeking to recover nearly $670 million in transfers.</p>
<p>This comes amidst an already challenging legal landscape for Genesis and Gemini, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-gemini-file-for-dismissal-of-secs-earn-program-lawsuit-heres-latest.htm">both entities face a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), alleging the sale of unregistered securities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the state of New York has filed a lawsuit against Genesis, Gemini, and DCG, accusing the trio of defrauding investors.</p>

<p>The Special Investigation Team formed to investigate the alleged $240 million crypto fraud in India will file chargesheet against the three main accused this week.</p>
<p>Over 100,000 victims were duped in an alleged multilevel fake crypto scheme that also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-1000-police-personnel-duped-in-240-million-crypto-scam-in-india.htm">involved over 1000 police officials</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ptinews.com/news/north/thousands-lose-over-rs-200-crore-in-series-of-crypto-rug-pulls-in-himachal-pradesh-police-yet-to-catch-kingpin/661868.html">fraud when first unveiled in October</a> was estimated to be at around $24 million but investigations found the fraud to be over $240 million.</p>
<h2>Police Arrested 19 Individuals Linked to Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As many as 19 individuals have been arrested so far in the massive crypto scam in India and property worth millions have been confiscated by the police.</p>
<p>Local media reported that initially <a href="https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/sit-to-file-chargesheet-against-three-this-week-566334">the police would file chargesheet in the court</a> against three accused — Hem Raj, Sukhdev and Abhishek — under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and Sections 21 and 23 of the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Scheme, 2019, also called the BUDS Act.</p>
<h2>Main Accused Remains at Large</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As reported earlier, the main accused in the case, Subhash Sharma, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mastermind-behind-indias-24-million-crypto-fraud-flees-country.htm">has fled the country</a> and is believed to be hiding in Dubai.</p>
<p>The official heading the special investigation team said the police were in the process of procuring an arrest warrant against the main accused.</p>
<p>The police would file chargesheet at the Shimla sessions court within a week, he added.</p>
<p>The accused allegedly initiated the sale of Korvio (KRO) and DGT cryptocurrency coins to consumers statewide. The promise of substantial returns, reaching up to 10% per month on investments, attracted initial investors. The expansion of the consumer base was further fueled by social media promotion claiming significant profits from cryptocurrency investments.</p>
<p>The police have received over 300 complaints from the victims of the scam.</p>

<p>Singapore&#8217;s central bank’s managing director, Ravi Menon, emphasized that private cryptocurrencies falling short of fundamental financial service tests will eventually fade from the monetary scene.</p>
<p>Menon outlined his vision for the future monetary system, highlighting three key components: central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized bank liabilities, and well-regulated stablecoins.</p>
<h2>“Private Cryptocurrencies Fail to Retain Value”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/singapore-central-banker-sees-private-cryptocurrencies-failing-1.2004145">panel discussion on the Future of the Monetary System</a> was jointly hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<p>During the event, Menon pointed out the shortcomings of private digital coins, stating that they &#8220;have miserably failed the test of money because they can&#8217;t keep value.&#8221;</p>
<p>He emphasized that individuals typically do not entrust their life savings to these assets, viewing them as tools for quick profit rather than reliable stores of value.</p>
<p>Menon predicted that private cryptocurrencies, specifically native digital tokens, will eventually exit the scene due to their inability to meet essential monetary criteria.</p>
<h2>RBI Deputy Governor Optimistic Over CBDC Success</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, M. Rajeshwar Rao, a deputy governor at the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rbi-governor-warns-of-crypto-risks-to-emerging-markets.htm">Reserve Bank of India</a>, shared insights during the same panel discussion.</p>
<p>Rao expressed optimism about the success of central bank digital currencies, highlighting the importance of meeting unmet user needs and employing accessible existing technology and infrastructure. He also mentioned the critical role of cybersecurity and resilience for CBDCs to gain trust.</p>
<p>Rao noted that the Reserve Bank of India is actively exploring offline transactions to enhance the practicality of CBDC usage. The RBI, among the few central banks <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indias-central-bank-launches-wholesale-cbdc-pilot-for-inter-bank-borrowing.htm">conducting CBDC pilots</a>, envisions its digital currency facilitating interbank money market transactions.</p>
<p>While CBDCs currently operate on a bilateral basis, Rao suggested that future considerations should explore implementing them on a multilateral basis.</p>

<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking evidence regarding Binance.US&#8217;s alleged backdoor control over customer assets, resembling a structure akin to FTX, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-11-27-2023/card/sec-keeps-pressing-for-evidence-of-potential-fraud-at-binance-us-FteJJJqSg6PWXrwquJul">Wall Street Journal reported</a>.</p>
<p>In June, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm">SEC initiated legal action against Binance</a> and its American counterpart, Binance.US, asserting their involvement in the sale of unregistered securities.</p>
<h2>SEC Alleges Binance of Fraud</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The SEC lawsuit accused Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), of participating in a complex conspiracy involving fraud, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and willful disregard for the law.</p>
<p>One specific allegation suggested that the exchange had discretionarily redirected customer assets, including funds sent to the Switzerland-based Sigma Chain under Zhao&#8217;s control.</p>
<p>During a recent federal court hearing on November 27, Binance.US attorneys argued that the SEC lacked evidence of asset misuse. They urged U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui to consider halting the SEC&#8217;s investigation into potential fraud.</p>
<p>Binance.US attorney Matthew Laroche highlighted the soaring costs of the lawsuit, pointing out that Binance.US assets had plummeted nearly 90%, and its user base had halved since the SEC filed the initial lawsuit.</p>
<p>This development occurred alongside <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Binance and CZ&#8217;s agreement to plead guilty</a> to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws in a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, Treasury, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the previous week.</p>
<h2>DoJ’s Cases Does Not Include SEC Lawsuit</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Judge Faruqui, overseeing the Binance and SEC case, expressed skepticism about the misappropriation of customer assets, citing the guilty pleas. He urged both parties to resolve the dispute, setting a deadline of December 15 for an update.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-judge-binance-founder-changpeng-cz-zhao-cannot-leave-the-u-s-for-the-time-being-whats-going-on.htm">CZ awaits a court review to determine if he can leave the U.S.</a> and return two weeks before his scheduled sentencing date in February. The judge&#8217;s order restricts CZ from traveling to the United Arab Emirates, his primary base, until a court rules on a motion for review from the U.S. government.</p>

<p>US-based crypto exchange giant Coinbase is looking to expand its workforce in India despite facing regulatory setbacks for its products.</p>
<p>The company is actively recruiting for product and technology positions, both in remote capacities and at its Bengaluru and Hyderabad locations.</p>
<p>Among the roles being filled are software engineers, engineering managers specializing in platform-payments, data scientists, and vendor management analysts.</p>
<p>Although the exact number of new hires is undisclosed, approximately 30 open positions have been listed on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3766285901&amp;f_C=2857634&amp;geoId=92000000&amp;origin=COMPANY_PAGE_JOBS_CLUSTER_EXPANSION&amp;originToLandingJobPostings=3760324104%2C3765652971%2C3765656597%2C3760319807%2C3760318849%2C3766229708%2C3760321845%2C3766285902%2C3752341280">Coinbase&#8217;s LinkedIn page</a> in the past three weeks.</p>
<h2>Indian Tech Talent Attracts Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Insiders revealed that Coinbase has recently accelerated its hiring efforts for product and tech roles, marking a notable shift in strategy.</p>
<p>This trend is observed not only at Coinbase but also at other cryptocurrency companies like Gemini, indicating a broader trend of establishing tech talent hubs in India.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, the crypto firm led by the Winklevoss twins is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/exclusive-india-will-core-hub-for-web3-innovation-says-gemini-apac-ceo.htm">committing to spend $24 million</a> in the next few years to establish its tech base in India</p>
<h2>Coinbase Back on Hiring Spree After Multiple Rounds of Layoffs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The latest hiring spree from Coinbase comes after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-announces-third-round-of-layoffs-reduces-headcount-by-950-employees.htm">multiple rounds of layoffs</a> since 2022.</p>
<p>In January 2023, the company announced the dismissal of around 950 employees. In June 2022, facing challenging market conditions in the crypto business, Coinbase laid off approximately 18 percent of its global staff, with about 8 percent of the India-based workforce affected.</p>
<p>Since then, the company had slowed down its hiring activities and withdrew job offers.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Coinbase is persistently investing in talent acquisition, particularly in the Indian market.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s journey in India has encountered difficulties, such as high taxes on crypto gains and challenges associated with enabling <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-halts-indias-upi-support-after-regulatory-uncertainty.htm">UPI-based payments</a> for buying or selling cryptocurrencies on the platform. UPI refers to the Unified Payments Interface, facilitating instant transfers between bank accounts.</p>
<p>Coinbase initially launched its services in India in April 2022, expressing plans to expand its Indian tech hub, which then employed about 300 full-time workers, with the addition of over 1,000 people in 2022. Coinbase did not respond to any queries at the time of writing.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWaNej58Wn0">interview with the NFT platform Defiant</a> during his visit to Turkey, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tackled the issue of staking centralization within the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Buterin highlighted the necessity to revamp Ethereum&#8217;s staking mechanism to foster healthier mining and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-staking-platforms.htm">staking pools</a>, ultimately aiming to enhance the overall decentralization of the platform.</p>
<p>The proposed initiative comes as a response to the challenges posed by the sluggish movement of data availability in off-chain systems, primarily attributed to the high demands in the near-term and mid-term.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Shares Dankshrading Details</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Addressing an imminent upgrade in the Ethereum ecosystem, Buterin shed light on EIP 4844, commonly known as Danksharding.</p>
<p>This upgrade is poised to enhance the data map space, increasing it to 16 Megabytes per slot. The post-upgrade phase will involve configuring parameters and attributes to refine Ethereum&#8217;s scalability and efficiency.</p>
<p>In a shift toward a more democratic and less disruptive process, Buterin proposed the implementation of a voting system to govern future changes on the Ethereum network, potentially eliminating the need for hard forks. This strategic move aligns with Ethereum&#8217;s continuous evolution to address scalability challenges.</p>
<p>The Dencun upgrade, a crucial element in Ethereum&#8217;s roadmap, is expected to go live in early 2024. This upgrade aims to play a pivotal role in improving Ethereum&#8217;s scalability, efficiency, and decentralization.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Founder Praises UTxO Payment Model</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
During the interview, Buterin also explored the possibility of adopting the Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) approach, a model utilized by blockchains such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> and Cardano. This consideration reflects Ethereum&#8217;s openness to diverse approaches in addressing existing challenges within its network.</p>
<p>While Buterin&#8217;s proposals generated discussions within the crypto community, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson responded with a touch of sarcasm, stating, &#8220;No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Circle, stablecoin issuer behind USD Coin (USDC), <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/sbi-holdings-partners-with-circle-to-pioneer-digital-currency-innovation-in-japan-with-usdc-banking-and-web3-services">has joined forces with Tokyo-based financial services firm SBI Holdings</a> to facilitate the strategic expansion of USDC into the Japanese market.</p>
<p>This collaboration, solidified through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed on November 27, aims to leverage the evolving regulatory landscape in Japan, particularly the revised <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/japanese-stablecoin-ban-lifted-banks-prepare-move.htm">Payment Services Act</a> introduced in June, Circle announced today.</p>
<p>The revised act establishes regulations for stablecoins, a move Circle anticipates will stimulate the issuance and circulation of stablecoins in Japan, fostering the country&#8217;s transition towards a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3</a> economy.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, Circle CEO <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usdc-issuer-circle-looking-issue-stablecoin-japan.htm">Jeremy Allaire expressed his intention to launch stablecoin in Japan</a> in July this year.</p>
<h2>Circle and SBI Holdings Plan on Expanding USDC Adoption</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To pave the way for the introduction of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/v">USDC</a> into Japan, SBI Holdings is pursuing registration as an electronic payment instruments service, a process contingent on approval by Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>SBI Holdings CEO and President Yoshitaka Kitao views this initiative as a pivotal step towards achieving mass stablecoin adoption in the country. Kitao said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Japan is steadily preparing the groundwork for the full-scale introduction of stablecoins [and] we are very pleased to have signed a basic agreement for a comprehensive business alliance with Circle.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The collaboration also involves SBI Shinsei Bank, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, providing banking services to Circle. This partnership will play a crucial role in enabling USDC access and liquidity for businesses and users based in Japan.</p>
<h2>70% of USDC Adoption is Outside of USA</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Circle&#8217;s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, emphasized the shared vision between Circle and SBI Holdings for the future of digital currency in Japan and Asia. Allaire expressed excitement about the collaboration and its potential to set new standards in the financial sector in Japan.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">USDC is coming to Japan &#8211; Circle and SBI Holdings begin partnership combining USDC distribution, banking and Web3 tech proliferation for the Japan market.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While Circle is headquartered in the United States, it noted in August that 70% of USDC adoption is occurring overseas, with Asia leading the way. Allaire highlighted the strong demand for &#8220;safe, transparent digital dollars&#8221; not only in Asia but also in Latin America and Africa.</p>
<p>USDC, currently the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether (USDT), boasts a market cap of $24.6 billion.</p>

<h2>ARK Invest Sells GBTC Shares Despite Bullish Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This reduction in holdings is noteworthy given the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, reaching its highest level since May 2022 earlier this month. Despite regulatory uncertainties and actions against key figures in the crypto space, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-coin-price-prediction-as-changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-after-doj-settlement-will-bnb-rally-or-dump-now.htm">Binance&#8217;s Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/disgraced-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-friend-found-guilty-on-all-seven-fraud-charges.htm">FTX&#8217;s Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year.</p>
<p>Earlier, Cathie Wood endorsed GBTC as her top pick at the Sohn Australia conference held at the Sydney Opera House, as reported by the <a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/asx-to-fall-wall-street-rally-runs-out-of-momentum-20231117-p5ekpl?post=p55ft6">Australian Financial Review</a>. As of September 30, ARK was the fourth-largest holder of GBTC, possessing 5.6 million shares.</p>
<p>While Wood and ARK&#8217;s officials have yet to respond to inquiries about the reduction in GBTC holdings, the move contrasts with Wood&#8217;s public stance on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkkDaily">daily trading updates from ARK</a> reflect active decisions by the management team, excluding creation or redemption activity influenced by investor flows.</p>
<p>ARK&#8217;s Next Generation Internet ETF has displayed robust performance throughout the year, boasting a 65% increase compared to the Nasdaq 100 Index&#8217;s 46% advance.</p>

<p>Atletico Madrid, the renowned Spanish football club, is suing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/singapore/">Singapore</a>-based crypto exchange WhaleFin, following the unexpected termination of its $44 million shirt sponsorship deal.</p>
<p>The football club is seeking $24 million in damages, citing crypto exchange WhaleFin&#8217;s alleged breach of contract as the basis for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spanish-football-clubs-sue-crypto-sponsors-which-teams-are-affected.htm">Spanish Football clubs sued several crypto sponsors.</a></p>
<h2>Atletico Madrid Claims Breach of Contract</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The dispute centers around WhaleFin&#8217;s premature termination of the sponsorship agreement, leading to financial losses and reputational damage for Atletico Madrid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sportbusiness.com/news/atletico-to-sue-whalefin-for-e20m-over-terminated-shirt-sponsorship/">Sport Business has reported</a> that the football club had anticipated substantial revenues from the partnership, contributing to ongoing operations and future investments.</p>
<p>However, with the sudden termination, Atletico Madrid now faces financial uncertainty and the need to explore alternative revenue sources.</p>
<p>Beyond the financial impact, the football club is concerned about potential repercussions on its brand image, having built a reputation for professionalism and reliability in the industry.</p>
<p>WhaleFin has yet to provide a detailed explanation for the termination of the sponsorship deal, adding to the complexities of the legal battle. The outcome of the case is expected to set a precedent for future contracts and relationships between football clubs and crypto sponsors, shaping the dynamics of sponsorship agreements in the world of sports.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges posed by the terminated deal, Atletico Madrid remains optimistic about its future. The club recently secured a significant sponsorship agreement with Riyadh Air, designating the Saudi Arabian airline as its official shirt sponsor, according to Sportcal.</p>

<p>Mumbai&#8217;s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) in India received a bomb threat on Thursday, with an anonymous sender demanding $1 million in Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) within 48 hours.</p>
<p>The threatening email, originating from the address quaidacasrol@gmail.com, was directed to the feedback inbox of Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) at approximately 11:06 am.</p>
<p>The message explicitly warned of an imminent explosion at Terminal 2 unless the specified Bitcoin amount was transferred within the given timeframe.</p>
<p>Security measures were promptly heightened at the airport in response to the threat.</p>
<h2>Case Registered Against the Unknown Sender</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Local police have registered a case against the unknown sender, initiating investigations into the incident.</p>
<p>MIAL executive Vismay Pathak, who reported the threat, disclosed, &#8220;I was at the quality and customer care center in the airport when I came across the threat mail. The mail threatened to blow up the airport within 48 hours if the ransom was not paid,&#8221; <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/threat-to-blow-up-mumbai-t2-airport-in-48-hours-if-one-million-dollars-in-bitcoin-not-paid/articleshow/105453837.cms">Times of India reported</a>.</p>
<p>Efforts to trace the origin of the threat have commenced, with police tracking the internet protocol (IP) address used to send the menacing email.</p>
<p>The cyber section of the police station is actively working to identify the person behind the threat.</p>
<p>A case has been registered under sections 385 (Putting person in fear of injury to commit extortion) and 505 (1) (b) (Statements made with intent to cause fear or alarm to the public or against the public tranquility) of the Indian Penal Code.</p>
<p>Authorities are working diligently to ensure the protection of both travelers and staff. As the situation develops, Mumbai&#8217;s airport remains on high alert, with authorities focused on tracing the individual responsible for the threatening communication.</p>
