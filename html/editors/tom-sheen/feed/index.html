<p>Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is a high-potential new crypto presale and the very first stake-to-mine project to come to market.</p>
<p>Having already raised more than $4.2 million in its presale, Bitcoin Minetrix allows investors to stake tokens for large annual percentage yields (APY) as well as take part in cloud mining for BTC rewards.</p>
<p>Unlike other cloud mining projects, however, Bitcoin Minetrix has a very low barrier for entry &#8211; $10 &#8211; and heightened security.</p>
<h2>What is Bitcoin Minetrix?</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> is the very first stake-to-mine project where users can stake their BTCMTX tokens to generate credits that can be spent on cloud mining time.</p>
<p>This means that holding tokens and staking them allows investors to earn BTC via mining &#8211; which is usually the sole preserve of multi-million-dollar companies due to the prohibitive cost of mining rigs and the massive energy consumption.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125675/331838/stake-to-mine.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix stake to earn" /></figure>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is a cloud mining project but with a major difference in that there is a small barrier to entry, no upfront costs, fixed contracts, or hidden fees and investors have power over their tokens at all times.</p>
<p>Token holders can also generate huge staking rewards which, at the time of writing, sit at over 60,000%.</p>

<h3>How Bitcoin Minetrix Works</h3>
<p>The platform has a simple process for mining BTC: </p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase BTCMTX tokens during the presale or after they are listed on exchanges.</li>
<li>Stake them to generate Cloud Mining Credits, a non-tradeable ERC-20 token.</li>
<li>Burn Cloud Mining Credits in exchange for Bitcoin cloud mining power or a percentage of mining yields.</li>
<li>Transfer minted BTC to a personal crypto wallet.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tokenization of hash power has several major advantages, including that users retain full control over funds.</p>
<p>Through an upcoming mobile app, which is in development, it will be possible to decide how many BTCMTX tokens to stake and how long for.</p>
<p>They can also be unstaked at any time, providing huge flexibility, and can be sold on exchanges if the holder wishes.</p>
<p>This removes the need to pay further cash or enter into fixed-term contracts with cloud mining firms &#8211; many of which have turned out to be scams in recent years.</p>

<h3>Cloud Mining Plagued by Scammers</h3>
<p>Cloud mining is nothing new but the tokenization of the process offers a sea change in security and the ability to take part in the potentially lucrative ecosystem.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is now dominated by huge corporations set up solely for the purpose of mining Bitcoin, with the current cost to mine one Bitcoin (estimated at $42,000) far exceeding the current price of BTC (approx. $26,000).</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125675/331833/bitcoin-minetrix-reasons-2.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Minetrix features" /></figure>
<p>Cloud mining was set up as a way for groups of people or organizations to club together and rent or pay for computing power and energy consumption, with profits distributed.</p>
<p>However, numerous scams in the industry popped up, with cloud mining firms often asking for huge upfront payments for fixed-term contracts and then providing large and complicated contracts that were difficult to parse.</p>
<p>They regularly added on fees at the back for spurious claims such as hardware maintenance and energy consumption which cut into any profits.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix solves all those issues by tokenizing the process and allowing users to keep control of how much they want to stake and how long for.</p>
<p>With a minimum purchase of just $10 in the presale it is also the cheapest way to mine Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Tokenomics and Presale Info</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> presale launched with tokens available for $0.011 during stage 1 of 39. By the final round, the price will increase to $0.0148 per token. Currently, $BTCMTX is priced at $0.0118 per token.</p>
<p>There is a max supply of 4 billion tokens with 70% of those (2.4 billion) available to purchase during the presale, depending on the performance.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125675/331834/tokenomics-2.jpg" alt="BTCMTX tokenomics" /></figure>
<p>The soft cap is set at $15.6 million for 1.4bn tokens and the hard cap at $32 million if the full presale sells out.</p>
<p>More information on the project can be found in the Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper, with the presale stages outlined below:</p>
<h2>How to Buy Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) Guide</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Here are some easy steps to buy and stake <a href="https://bitcoinminetrix.com/">Bitcoin Minetrix</a> during its 10-stage presale</p>
<h3>Step 1: Download MetaMask</h3>
<p>Investors will need to download a Web3 wallet to convert and hold their BTCMTX tokens and function with the presale site.</p>
<p>We will use MetaMask in this guide as it is a popular and highly secure crypto wallet with multi-chain functionality, although the likes of Trust Wallet and Phantom are also recommended.</p>
<p>Download MetaMask as either an app on Android/iPhone or as a desktop browser extension, set up an account, and safely secure the password and seed phrase.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/metamask2.jpg" alt="MetaMask crypto wallet" /></figure>
<h3>Step 2: Purchase ETH, USDT or BNB</h3>
<p>Investors cannot directly buy BTCMTX with fiat currency so first need a suitable crypto to convert it with.</p>
<p>ETH, USDT or BNB can be used, although ETH is the easiest for beginners as some will also be required to cover network (gas) fees later on.</p>
<p>Either transfer ETH from a centralized exchange such as Binance or Coinbase, or purchase ETH directly on the crypto wallet via trusted brokers such as MoonPay.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Connect Wallet to Presale Site</h3>
<p>Visit <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">bitcoinminetrix.com</a> and select the &#8216;Connect Wallet&#8217; button which can be seen in orange. Select MetaMask or an alternative and then follow the steps to make the connection, filling in your password etc. </p>
<p>Once the connection is made, the website will show different options than it did previously.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125675/331836/connect.jpg" alt="Purchase BTCMTX tokens with crypto" /></figure>
<h3>Step 4: Purchase Tokens</h3>
<p>Now is the time to buy $BTCMTX &#8211; there are three options, ETH, USDT or BNB &#8211; with buyers required to either input the amount they want to spend or the number of tokens they wish to purchase.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, some funds will need to be left untouched to cover gas fees, while there is a minimum purchase of $10.</p>
<p>It is also possible to immediately stake tokens and earn APY throughout the presale &#8211; skip to step 5 if you intend to stake.</p>
<p>If not, then select the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button, where a new window should pop up to continue and confirm the transaction. Skip to step 6 if choosing this option.</p>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img alignnone" src="https://cimg.co/news/125675/331835/bitcoin-minetrix-buy-2.jpg" alt="Buy BTCMTX tokens" /></figure>
<h3>Step 5: Stake $BTCMTX Tokens</h3>
<p>Should you wish to stake tokens and earn annual percentage yield (APY) &#8211; which currently sits at over 138% &#8211; then select the &#8216;Buy and Stake for xxx Rewards&#8217; button.</p>
<p>A new window will appear asking how many tokens you intend to stake and for how long, with rewards available until the presale ends and beyond.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Claim Tokens</h3>
<p>Tokens purchased during the presale will be stored on the website until the Token Generation Event (TGE) at the end of the presale &#8211; there is no timeline for when the presale may end, it will depend on performance.</p>
<p>The project will notify buyers of the time and date to claim and when that time comes, return to the presale website and connect once again.</p>
<p>There will be an option to &#8216;Claim&#8217; tokens, which will then be transferred to your MetaMask or crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinminetrix">Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram</a> group to keep up to date with the project.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix is an exciting new crypto presale that is the world&#8217;s first stake-to-mine project.</p>
<p>That means that any retail investor or crypto speculator can be a part of the highly lucrative Bitcoin mining ecosystem, with the project smashing down barriers by offering mining from just $10.</p>
<p>The BTCMTX token, as well as being staked to generate mining power, can also be staked to earn huge APYs &#8211; with the current pool offering over 138% rewards.</p>
<p>The presale has already raised more than $4.2 million and will run for 39 stages.</p>

By offering the project at $0.99, a price not seen in more than a decade, investors are essentially getting a second chance at purchasing Bitcoin.</p><p>The biggest criticisms levelled against Bitcoin have been its inefficiency, because of its PoW consensus mechanism, and its lack of utility because of that.</p><p>Bitcoin BSC has no such concerns &#8211; being built upon the Binance Smart Chain and being a BEP-20 token mean it is much more scalable than Bitcoin, more energy efficient and cheaper to process transactions.</p><h3>Staking Rewards</h3><p>Arguably the biggest draw of Bitcoin BSC is its stake-to-earn feature, which allows holders to lock tokens into a pool and generate token rewards through an annualized percentage yield.</p><p>According to the staking dashboard, 0.25 BTCBSC will be rewarded per block with staking reards paid every 10 minutes.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/124307/328171/bitcoin-bsc-staking.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/124307/328171/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-staking___media_library_original_1134_827.jpg 1134w, https://cimg.co/news/124307/328171/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-staking___media_library_original_900_656.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/124307/328171/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-staking___media_library_original_720_525.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/124307/328171/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-staking___media_library_original_600_438.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/124307/328171/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-staking___media_library_original_300_219.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1134" class="content-img"></figure><p>At the time of writing only a limited number of tokens have been added into the pool &#8211; with the current estimated APY sitting at 26,000%.</p><p>That will come down significantly in the coming days and weeks as more tokens are added to the pool, but taking BTC20 as an example, that staking pool is currently offering around 60% APY.</p><p>That is significantly higher than other popular staking tokens such as Ethereum, Cardano and Solana, which typically return APYs in the 5% to 10% range.</p><p>Staking also has a knock-on effect of reducing selling pressure on a token and incentivizing holding. Many investors are inclined to keep their tokens locked in a pool to earn rewards rather than selling them on exchanges, which keeps the value up.</p><p>Investors should note that there is a minimum seven-day locking period after adding tokens to the staking pool.</p><h3>Robust Tokenomics and Scarcity</h3><p>Like Bitcoin, BTCBSC tokens are in short supply &#8211; there is a maximum supply of 21 million tokens.</p><p>An initial 4 million has been made available for the presale, with a further 2.125 million part of an oversupply should the presale perform well with huge interest.</p><p>That 6.125 million represents 29% of the overall supply. Another 420,000 (2%) pre-mined tokens will be allocated for liquidity on Uniswap after the presale is closed.</p><p>Then, the remaining allocation, 14.455 million (69%) tokens, will be unlocked over a 120-year cycle &#8211; the same schedule as Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin BSC is also a 100% community-driven project, with no team allocation or hidden concerns.

That is based on the expectation that the next |Bitcoin halving, due in mid-2024, will spark a crypto bull run, with BTCBSC to capitalize on that and hold its value due to the staking rewards on offer decreasing selling pressure</p><p><strong>How much will Bitcoin BSC be worth in 2030?</strong></p><p>It is impossible to accurately predict the price of any crypto at the end of the decade, but BTCBSC has long term potential because of its staking model and robust tokenomics, which mirror Bitcoin. The expectation is that by 2030, the whole crypto market will be much more mainstream with the overall market cap many times greater than its current figure of $1 trillion. We predict a price of around $12.50.</p>

Full Step-by-Step Guide</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>While the chance to purchase Bitcoin for less than $1 is long gone, BTCBSC is offering investors a project that mirrors BTC but has also several distinct advantages.</p><p>Here are five easy steps to follow to purchase and stake <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-bsc/en">Bitcoin BSC</a> during its presale:</p><h3>Step 1: Download a Crypto Wallet</h3><p>To take part in the presale, a crypto wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet is required. Both of these are highly secure and recommended and are available as either mobile apps or desktop browser extensions.</p><p>For the sake of this article, we will use MetaMask in our examples.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/metamask2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/responsive-images/metamask2___media_library_original_1513_688.jpg 1513w, https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/responsive-images/metamask2___media_library_original_1200_546.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/responsive-images/metamask2___media_library_original_900_409.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/responsive-images/metamask2___media_library_original_720_327.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/responsive-images/metamask2___media_library_original_600_273.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/124295/328130/responsive-images/metamask2___media_library_original_300_136.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1513" class="content-img"></figure><h3>Step 2: Load Wallet with Crypto</h3><p>Next, investors will need to carry crypto in their wallets to use to convert for BTCBSC later on.</p><p>BNB, ETH or USDT is required for that and MetaMask allows users to purchase those tokens directly on its platform &#8211; via trusted third-party apps such as MoonPay and Mercuryo &#8211; or by transferring from a crypto exchange.</p><p>Whichever crypto you choose, a small amount of BNB will also be required in the wallet to cover gas (transaction) fees and is recommended also to earn staking rewards.</p><h3>Step 3: Visit BTCBSC Website and Connect</h3><p>Then head to the <a href="https://bitcoinbsc.io/en">bitcoinbsc.io</a> website and select &#8216;Connect Wallet&#8217;. Select MetaMask and enter your password unlock and then connect to the presale website.</p><p>The website should now look different and will give you the option to buy with BNB, ETH or USDT &#8211; when selecting BNB, it will also ask you to switch chain, which you must do.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/124295/328132/bitcoin-bsc-connect-wallet.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/124295/328132/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-connect-wallet___media_library_original_374_415.jpg 374w, https://cimg.co/news/124295/328132/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-connect-wallet___media_library_original_300_333.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="374" class="content-img"></figure><h3>Step 4: Purchase BTCBSC</h3><p>Enter the amount of BNB you wish to spend or the amount of BTCBSC to receive &#8211; there is a minimum purchase amount of $10 or 10 BTCBSC.</p><p>Once you have entered the amount, and allowed for gas (which should cost no more than $3), you can then either select &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; or &#8216;Buy and Stake&#8217;.</p><p>By selecting the first option, the tokens will not be added to the staking pool immediately and will be held in place until the presale ends, when they can then be claimed and held, staked or sold on exchanges after launch.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/124295/328135/bitcoin-bsc-buy-with-bnb.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/124295/328135/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-buy-with-bnb___media_library_original_386_587.jpg 386w, https://cimg.co/news/124295/328135/responsive-images/bitcoin-bsc-buy-with-bnb___media_library_original_300_456.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="386" class="content-img"></figure><h3>Step 5: Stake BTCBSC</h3><p>The second option is to press &#8216;Buy and Stake&#8217; which immediately adds your purchased tokens into the staking pool and allows for APY to be earned from the get-go.</p><p>As noted above, there is a seven-day minimum locking period on staked <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-bsc/en">BTCBSC tokens</a>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Bitcoin BSC is an exciting new presale coin and a Bitcoin mirror that makes significant improvements on BTC.</p><p>It has the same 21 million supply and 120-year unlocking period but also is a proof-of-stake coin, rather than proof-of-work, and built upon the Binance Smart Chain, meaning it is much more scalable, efficient and eco-friendly.</p><p>As a PoS token it also offers incredible staking rewards for those that add their BTCBSC to the staking pool &#8211; currently the APY stands at 33,232%, although that will come down as more tokens are locked in.</p><p>The presale has already raised $25k in just 12 hours as it quickly spreads through Web3.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoin-bsc/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Bitcoin BSC Presale</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>What is Bitcoin BSC?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin BSC (BTCBSC) is a new stake-to-earn crypto coin that mirrors Bitcoin but offers several improvements, including staking rewards. It is a proof-of-stake coin built on the Binance Smart Chain, meaning it is more scalable, efficient and eco-friendly, as well as offering cheaper transactions.</p><p><strong>How to Invest in Bitcoin BSC?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin BSC has just launched its presale with tokens priced at $0.99 &#8211; the same price as Bitcoin was in 2011. The presale is offering 6.125 million tokens and can be purchased with BNB, ETH or USDT.</p><p><strong>What is the Bitcoin BSC Market Cap?</strong></p><p>While on presale the project does not have an official market cap, however, if all presale tokens are sold it will have an initial market cap of around $6 million. The majority of tokens will be released over a 120-year cycle, like Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How Much Can I Earn Staking Bitcoin BSC?</strong></p><p>The staking pool has only just launched and the current estimated APY is 33,000% &#8211; however, this will come down as more tokens are added to the pool. Other PoS tokens such as Ethereum, Solana and Cardano, typically offer 5-10% but BTC20, another Bitcoin mirror, offers 60% APY.</p>

which can be time-consuming and laborious.</p><p>This allows users to be in the market 24/7 rather than constantly being in front of the platform and performing trades themselves.</p><p>With the crypto market being especially volatile, it is near-impossible for humans to stay on top of developing trends and execute profitable trades, or stop losses, at the opportune time.&nbsp;</p><p>AI crypto trading bots allow users to automate that process based on a user&#8217;s instruction and strategy or by providing a pre-built template that is adjusted for risk.</p><p>AI crypto trading bots are also different from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-robo-advisors.htm">crypto robo advisors</a>, which utilize advanced algorithms to generate advice on the best times to buy and sell as well as individual assets to invest in.</p><h2>How do AI Crypto Trading Bots Work?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The best AI crypto trading bots come in different shapes and sizes, and work in a variety of ways, with some more suited to beginners and others for advanced and professional traders.</p><p>Some beginner AI crypto trading bots, for example, will operate by copy-trading other profitable users, essentially mirroring all the trades an individual trader makes and applying them to a different user.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/106351/259761/dash-2-trade-bots.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/106351/259761/responsive-images/dash-2-trade-bots___media_library_original_877_312.jpg 877w, https://cimg.co/news/106351/259761/responsive-images/dash-2-trade-bots___media_library_original_720_256.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/106351/259761/responsive-images/dash-2-trade-bots___media_library_original_600_213.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/106351/259761/responsive-images/dash-2-trade-bots___media_library_original_300_107.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="877" class="content-img"></figure><p>Some use pre-built strategies and parameters which a user can adjust and select based on their risk tolerance and preferences, which offer short-term and long-term strategies and varying returns.</p><p>Other AI crypto trading platforms allow advanced traders to utilize their knowledge and strategy to build fully customizable crypto trading bots from the ground up, so they can operate on a 24/7 basis.</p><p>Platforms such as Dash 2 Trade and Learn2Trade offer their users custom and bespoke signals &#8211; highlighting buying and selling opportunities in the market and providing exact details on when to execute trades and how much to risk.</p><p>Others allow users to integrate signals from other platforms, such as TradingView, and automatically execute those strategies.</p><p>How users access the crypto trading platforms can vary, with many offering tiered subscriptions that offer varying levels of features and others totally free but charging a percentage for every trade.</p><p>AI crypto trading bots remove a lot of emotion from trading and those looking for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-tips.htm">best crypto trading tips</a> should definitely consider them.</p><h2>Are AI Crypto Trading Bots Legit and Safe?</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>AI crypto trading bots can be highly profitable but, like with any crypto or asset trading, there are inherent risks.</p><p>There is no guarantee they will be profitable and even the best and most experienced traders will make bad trades, so those using AI crypto trading bots should consistently monitor performance and not invest more than they can afford to use.</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/106351/259762/learn2trade-trustpilot.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/106351/259762/responsive-images/learn2trade-trustpilot___media_library_original_1099_455.jpg 1099w, https://cimg.co/news/106351/259762/responsive-images/learn2trade-trustpilot___media_library_original_900_373.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/106351/259762/responsive-images/learn2trade-trustpilot___media_library_original_720_298.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/106351/259762/responsive-images/learn2trade-trustpilot___media_library_original_600_248.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/106351/259762/responsive-images/learn2trade-trustpilot___media_library_original_300_124.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1099" class="content-img"></figure><p>Investors and traders should ignore any website or social media post that links to a crypto trading bot that guarantees profits, as the market does not work like that.</p><p>Furthermore, beginners would be best sticking to the copy trading features or pre-built strategies rather than attempting to build and develop their own scripts before they are totally prepared, as errors in the script will lead to losses.&nbsp;</p><p>There are dozens of AI crypto trading platforms appearing on the market but the ones we have featured in this review are safe and trustworthy.</p><p>Dash 2 Trade, for example, attracted more than $15 million of investment during its presale round in late 2022, while Learn2Trade has a four-star rating on the leading peer review website TrustPilot. Zingaly, meanwhile, has more than 440,000 users and around $120 million of assets under its management.</p><h2>How to Pick the Best AI Crypto Trading Bots</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Selecting the best AI crypto trading bot will depend on the user, as they each have different advantages and disadvantages that will appeal to different traders.</p><p>There are a huge variety of tools available, from pre-built trading strategies that beginners can just use with limited input to platforms that allow for bots that are fully customizable and can be built from scratch to their exact preference.</p><p>Some platforms offer only limited features, stripping away to the bare bones of just the trading bot, while others offer huge amounts of analytical data points and metrics to help traders maximize their knowledge and profits.</p><p>Furthermore, as mentioned several times above, the price to access the differing platforms has wide variety &#8211; with many offering tiered monthly membership that offers access to different features and tools, while others have no membership subscriptions at all but charge commission on trades.</p><p>Users should always conduct individual research and weigh up the pros and cons of each platform, the features offered, the price and how much they intend to use the bot.</p><p>It is also crucial to cross-check review websites such as TrustPilot and social media sites such as Twitter and Reddit to see what current customers think of a certain platform and the services offered.</p><p>Dash 2 Trade (D2T) and Zingaly (ZIG) also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">high-potential crypto tokens</a> to invest in.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>AI crypto trading bots are an extremely useful and often profitable tool for investors to maximize their cryptocurrency trading.</p><p>The bots are not infallible, however, and potential users should be careful to find the platform that best suits their needs &#8211; whether that is one that offers simple beginner copy trading features or more advanced tools such as customizable scripts.</p><p>We found that Dash 2 Trade was the overall best AI crypto trading bot, not only because of its AI-powered tools but because of its wide range of other features that help users maximize their profit-making potential, from crypto signals and alerts, to its educational tools and bespoke crypto presale scoring system.</p><p>It also offers free, starter and premium subscription tiers for users and its native D2T token &#8211; which provides access to the protocol &#8211; is already one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">best new cryptos to buy in 2023</a>.</p><p>Similarly, Learn2Trade is a highly recommended and highly trusted platform as it already has a large user base of more than 70,000 and a four-star rating on TrustPilot.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px;"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dash-2-trade/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Dash 2 Trade</a></div></div><h2>FAQs</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><strong>What is AI Crypto Trading?</strong></p><p>AI crypto trading is when users allow an AI bot to operate and execute trades on their behalf. It means that individual traders can set certain parameters for a bot to follow and then trade 24/7.</p><p><strong>What is Bot Trading?</strong></p><p>Bot trading, as mentioned above, is when an AI bot executes trades on a user&#8217;s behalf. It can also mean when users utilize copy trading strategies which exactly mirror the moves of other profitable traders.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where to Buy AI Crypto?</strong></p><p>AI cryptos are available on all major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase and others. The best AI cryptos to buy include Dash 2 Trade (D2T), The Graph (GRT), Fetch.ai (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX).</p><p><strong>What is Fetch.ai Crypto?</strong></p><p>Fetch.ai (FET) is an AI lab building a decentralized machine learning network that is permissionless and open and allows anyone to build upon it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What Does AI Stand For?</strong></p><p>AI stands for artificial intelligence and, simply put, is a technology that enables a computer to think or act by taking information from its surroundings and deciding its own response based on its own learning and sense, rather than from its programming.</p>
