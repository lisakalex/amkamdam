As prices climb, investors are searching for the <strong>best crypto projects to buy now</strong> amid the bullish momentum. Experts are analyzing both established coins with sound fundamentals as well as <strong>up-and-coming crypto presales</strong> for their growth potential.&nbsp;</p><p>Top contenders for the <strong>best cryptos to buy now</strong> include blockchain leaders <strong>Mina Protocol, Conflux, and Filecoin</strong> alongside two promising presale tokens, <strong>Bitcoin Minetrix and TG.Casino</strong>, are also drawing interest from investors looking to diversify into early-stage crypto projects.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/Official_Upbit/status/1716690644717224014"></oembed></figure><p>The Mina Protocol&#8217;s MINA price is surging by 47.79% so far today, reaching a peak of $0.9648.</p><p>The sudden increase in MINA&#8217;s value was largely attributed to its new trading pairs being listed on Bitrue and Upbit. At its peak, MINA experienced a price jump of 108%.</p><p>The token&#8217;s price action was also influenced by Mina Protocol&#8217;s upcoming testnet launch and overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-hype-rally-weekly-inflows-66-million-investors-remain-bullish-solana-report.htm">renewed interest in Bitcoin spot ETF products</a>.</p><p>The native token of Conflux, CFX, is also exhibiting a bullish 32.53% price increase so far today, with its price trading at $0.1548. <a href="https://www.investorsobserver.com/crypto/7334/cfx">InvestorsObserver gave CFX a very favorable rating</a>, tying the cryptocurrency&#8217;s double-digit gain to the growing momentum around Web3 technologies.</p><p>Filecoin&rsquo;s FIL token has similarly seen positive price action over the past two days. After closing with a 12.80% move to the upside yesterday, FIL is seeing some price retracement as it currently attempts to mount the Fib 0.382 level of $3.736.</p><p>FIL&rsquo;s price is showcasing a 17.45% gain over the past week while celebrating <a href="https:///blog.archive.org/2023/10/20/celebrating-1-petabyte-on-the-filecoin-network/">the milestone of storing 1 petabyte of data on the network</a>.</p><p>Thanks to a solid foundation of exchange listings and technological advancements, Mina Protocol, Conflux, and Filecoin are gaining traction as some of the best cryptos to buy now.</p><p>While Mina Protocol, Conflux, and Filecoin are seeing an uptick in volatility so far today, Bitcoin Minetrix and TG.Casino are also offering the chance to get in early on projects with strong roadmaps and visions.</p><p>For those drawn to higher-risk, high-reward crypto presale prospects, Bitcoin Minetrix and TG.Casino are some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">best crypto presales to buy now</a>.</p><p>As the broader cryptocurrency market continues to see volatility, these projects may be worth watching for those interested in diversifying their crypto investments.</p><p>Read on for a detailed breakdown of the charts, tokenomics, and developments making Mina Protocol, Conflux, Filecoin, Bitcoin Minetrix, and TG.Casino the best cryptos to buy now.</p><h2><strong>Bitrue and Upbit Listing: Catalysts for Mina Protocol&#8217;s 108% MINA Price Jump</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126827/334887/10-24-23-cn-mina-chart.jpg" alt="TradingView chart for the MINA price 10-24-23" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126827/334887/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-mina-chart___media_library_original_1816_816.jpg 1816w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334887/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-mina-chart___media_library_original_1200_539.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334887/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-mina-chart___media_library_original_900_404.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334887/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-mina-chart___media_library_original_720_324.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334887/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-mina-chart___media_library_original_600_270.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334887/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-mina-chart___media_library_original_300_135.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1816" class="content-img"><figcaption><sup>Source: TradingView / </sup><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MINAUSDT/"><sup>MINAUSDT</sup></a></figcaption></figure><p>After a 108% surge to multi-month highs earlier today, Mina Protocol (MINA) saw an intraday pullback, though it remains up substantially as it works to sustain its gains.</p><p>With the MINA price giving back some of its parabolic advances but still elevated, technical gauges are at critical inflection points regarding the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s immediate path forward.</p><p>The 20-day EMA for the MINA price stands at $0.4155, while the 50-day EMA sits at $0.3992. With both these short and long-term EMAs well below current prices, this signals MINA has experienced a strong singular-day breakout. However, its inability to hold its intraday peak suggests some caution may be prudent.</p><p>The RSI has surged from yesterday&#8217;s reading of 79.91 up to an overbought level of 92.55 today. While clearly in stretched territory, this sharp rise aligns with the tremendous intraday uptick in the MINA price.</p><p>However, the risk is that decreasing upward momentum could materialize as MINA pulls back from its unsustainable spike highs.</p><p>At the same time, the MACD histogram has risen from 0.0086 to 0.0257 within the day. This expanding positive value aligns with the initial explosion higher, though its slope may flatten if MINA struggles to extend gains.</p><p>Bolstering its huge intraday spike, MINA saw its market cap swell 49.30% to $686 million as 24-hour volume spiked 5,877.61% to $1.84 trillion. Maintaining these elevated activity levels will likely be required to sustain an upward trajectory.</p><p>Near-term resistance exists around MINA&#8217;s brief multi-month high from $0.6571 to $0.7236. The Fib 0.382 level at $0.7298 also marks a key test. Reclaiming these zones would renew upside potential.</p><p>Areas that provided resistance before the breakout around $0.4172 to $0.5102 may offer a demand floor on any further pullbacks. However, losing the horizontal support zone from $0.4172 to $0.4323 risks shifting the intraday trend back downward.</p><p>Despite giving back some gains after its parabolic spike, Mina Protocol retains a constructive short-term outlook amidst still-elevated technical readings. However, holding above the day&#8217;s breakout levels is vital to maintain a bullish bias.</p><p>With indicators at a potential turning point, trading cautiously with defined risk management is recommended. A decisive pivot past $0.7236 resistance or below $0.4172 support should determine MINA&#8217;s next directional move within the day.</p><h2><strong>Conflux CFX Price Soars 32.53%: Breakout Signals Bullish Potential</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126827/334888/10-24-23-cn-cfx.jpg" alt="TradingView chart for the CFX price 10-24-23" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126827/334888/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-cfx___media_library_original_1814_818.jpg 1814w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334888/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-cfx___media_library_original_1200_541.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334888/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-cfx___media_library_original_900_406.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334888/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-cfx___media_library_original_720_325.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334888/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-cfx___media_library_original_600_271.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334888/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-cfx___media_library_original_300_135.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1814" class="content-img"><figcaption><sup>Source: TradingView /</sup><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CFXUSDT/"><sup>CFXUSDT</sup></a></figcaption></figure><p>The CFX price has seen a dramatic turnaround in sentiment over the past 24 hours. After months of lackluster trading activity and range-bound price action, CFX surged 32.53% higher amid a spike in trading volume.</p><p>With technical indicators flashing bullish signals, CFX appears positioned for further gains after breaking out of its two-month trading range.</p><p>Despite the CFX price trading above its 20-day <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp">Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</a> of $0.1187 and 50-day EMA of $0.1253, the EMAs remain in a bearish alignment. This warrants some caution from traders as CFX will need to maintain its momentum to turn the tides on the EMAs.</p><p>The 100-day EMA at $0.1441 may provide an initial test if CFX sees any pullback from overbought RSI levels.</p><p>The RSI for CFX spiked to 71.37, up sharply from yesterday&#8217;s 49.76 reading. This shows that CFX is now in overbought territory after the latest rally. While this suggests CFX could be due for a cooldown, the RSI has room to rally further before becoming extremely overheated.</p><p>CFX also saw a bullish MACD crossover, with the MACD histogram improving to 0.0029 from -0.000 yesterday. The strengthening momentum points to gathering upside energy for CFX.</p><p>CFX&#8217;s trading volume surged 827.49% to $195.5 million over the past 24 hours. Increased conviction among CFX traders is fueling the breakout as market cap is expanding by 44.11% to $536.3 million. This uptick in activity after a period of consolidation seems to validate the rally.</p><p>With CFX rallying 32.53% to $0.1548 so far today, it has broken out of the two-month trading range between $0.1364 and $0.1400. CFX now faces initial resistance at $0.1662 to $0.1718 &#8211; the June 10 to August 15 trading range base.</p><p>On the downside, the 100-day EMA at $0.1441 and the former resistance zone of $0.1364 to $0.1400 may act as initial support on any pullbacks.</p><p>CFX&rsquo;s technical breakout has turned investor sentiment positive. The cryptocurrency looks poised to rally higher as long as volume remains robust. However, stretched RSI requires monitoring for overheating signals. CFX will need to take out further resistance levels to sustain its uptrend.</p><h2><strong>Filecoin File Price Prediction: Bulls Charge Ahead, Eyeing $4 Resistance</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126827/334889/10-24-23-cn-fil-chart.jpg" alt="TradingView chart for the FIL price 10-24-23" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126827/334889/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-fil-chart___media_library_original_1814_815.jpg 1814w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334889/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-fil-chart___media_library_original_1200_539.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334889/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-fil-chart___media_library_original_900_404.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334889/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-fil-chart___media_library_original_720_323.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334889/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-fil-chart___media_library_original_600_270.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126827/334889/responsive-images/10-24-23-cn-fil-chart___media_library_original_300_135.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1814" class="content-img"><figcaption><sup>Source: TradingView / </sup><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/FILUSDT/"><sup>FILUSDT</sup></a></figcaption></figure><p>After posting nearly 13% gains yesterday, the Filecoin (FIL) price is retracing slightly today, down 1.22% to $3.814. However, FIL remains well above key support levels, suggesting further upside potential after its bullish breakout this week.</p><p>The 20-day EMA for the FIL price stands at $3.370, crossing above the 50-day EMA at $3.374. This golden cross is a notably bullish sign, signaling growing momentum in the FIL price.</p><p>The RSI has pulled back from yesterday&#8217;s 77.08 to 73.64 today. While no longer in overbought territory, the RSI remains strongly in the bullish zone, signaling strength behind the FIL price.</p><p>The MACD histogram has risen to 0.067, up from 0.051 yesterday. This indicates the bullish trend is accelerating with buyers dominating.</p><p>FIL&#8217;s market cap now stands at $1.75 trillion, a 5.55% increase. Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volume has surged 184.29% to $341.6 million, highlighting rising interest in FIL among investors.</p><p>After breaking past resistance between $3.978 to $4.091, FIL set a new intraday high of $3.988 before pulling back. This area near $4 still marks the next target if the bulls can muster enough momentum.</p><p>On the downside, initial support appears around $3.736, the Fib 0.382 level that has contained today&#8217;s selloff so far. Below that, stronger support is seen between $3.566 to $3.620, near the 100-day EMA of $3.580.</p><p>Overall, the FIL price remains in an uptrend following its successful breakout. While overbought indicators warranted a cooling-off period, FIL has held key support levels on its pullback.</p><p>A sustained move above $3.978 resistance would reinforce the bullish outlook and open the door for a retest of $4. On the other hand, a drop below the $3.566 support zone would erase some bullish momentum.</p><p>With technical breakouts across top cryptocurrencies, we now explore how to complement established coins with calculated bets on some of the most promising crypto presales.</p><p>Bitcoin Minetrix and TG.Casino stand out for their intriguing models and potential to ride the crypto bull market&#8217;s coattails.</p><h2><strong>Bitcoin Alternative Presales to Watch</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>For those looking to diversify their investment portfolio away from Bitcoin, participating in crypto presales can offer intriguing initial-phase prospects with up-and-coming cryptocurrency projects and tokens.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C66Ny7-I9sA"></oembed></figure><p>By participating in presales, investors get the chance to purchase new cryptocurrencies at discounted prices, sometimes weeks or months before the cryptocurrencies are officially launched and listed on exchanges.</p><p>Two <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">presale projects on the radar in 2023</a> are Bitcoin Minetrix and TG.Casino.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Earn Bitcoin Block Rewards with Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s Unique Cloud Mining Protocol: Is This the Best Crypto to Buy Now?</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-touches-35000-for-first-time-since-may-last-year-can-an-etf-approval-send-btc-100000.htm">As Bitcoin&#8217;s price surges past the $35,000 mark for the first time since May 2022</a>, it paves the way for what specialists anticipate to be the most substantial bull run in Bitcoin&#8217;s history.</p><p>Capitalizing on this momentum is Bitcoin Minetrix, a unique tokenized cloud mining protocol established on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $2.23 million so far in the presale of its native token, BTCMTX. The new protocol will allow users to earn yield by staking their tokens to receive mining credits which provide a share of Bitcoin block rewards.</p><p>This model seeks to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-breakout-at-35000-heralds-start-of-biggest-bull-run-ever-as-bitcoin-minetrix-blasts-past-2-million-2000x-incoming.htm">democratize access to Bitcoin mining while eliminating common issues in cloud mining</a> like withdrawal delays and opaque fee structures.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/bitcoinminetrix/status/1716855035794010243"></oembed></figure><p>BTCMTX is currently priced at $0.0112 in the ongoing presale. The tokenomics allocate 7.5% of the total supply to staking rewards, with an enticing annual percent yield of up to 263% for early participants. As the presale progresses through stages, the price per token is set to increase.</p><p>With the Bitcoin halving set for 2024, mining revenues will be cut in half, but experts predict Bitcoin&#8217;s value will rise to offset this. &#8220;Bitcoin could hit $135,000 soon,&#8221; said Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, sees Bitcoin reaching $750,000.</p><p>As bullish indicators stack up, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dips-3-minutes-as-dtcc-removes-blackrocks-ishares-bitcoin-trust-ticker-from-list-are-spot-btc-etf-approvals-at-risk.htm">potential SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF</a>, Bitcoin Minetrix offers exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s growth story alongside mining income.</p><p>While a Bitcoin ETF provides exposure to price, BTCMTX captures the passive income stream many investors miss out on.</p><p>With presale prices a fraction of a penny, Bitcoin Minetrix offers an asymmetric upside compared to Bitcoin itself. As the leading cryptocurrency&#8217;s value balloons, BTCMTX could yield potential returns for early adopters.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix"><strong><u>Visit Bitcoin Minetrix Now</u></strong></a></p><h3><strong>TG.Casino Raises $1.47 Million in Ongoing $TGC Presale: A Game-Changer in Crypto Gambling</strong></h3><p>The crypto gambling sector continues its rise with the Telegram bot TG.Casino raising $1.47 million and counting from investors during its ongoing $TGC presale.</p><p>TG.Casino ($TGC) intends to lead the GambleFi niche thanks to its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">cutting-edge crypto casino business model</a> and integration with the popular Telegram messaging app. The presale will fund the project&#8217;s further development and marketing efforts.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/TGCasino_/status/1716719926449160402"></oembed></figure><p>The native $TGC token has seen strong demand in recent days as buyers move to lock in lower prices before increments increase.

<p>Web 3.0 is the <strong>next generation of the internet</strong>, where data and digital assets are owned and controlled by users, not by corporations or governments. It&#8217;s powered by blockchain technology, which enables decentralized applications (dApps) that run on peer-to-peer networks, without intermediaries or censorship. Web 3.0 is also the era of artificial intelligence (AI), which can enhance the functionality and usability of dApps, as well as create new possibilities for innovation and value creation.</p>
<p>AI and Web 3.0 are two of the most disruptive and transformative technologies of our time, and they are converging to create a new paradigm for the web. In this article, we will explore how AI and Web 3.0 can work together to create a more intelligent, secure, and democratic internet, where users can benefit from the collective intelligence and wisdom of the network.</p>
<p>One <strong>crypto startup</strong> in the space that offers a glimpse of the power of combining <strong>AI and crypto</strong> is <strong>yPredict</strong>, which is integrating artificial intelligence into every facet of its operations. With its presale nearing completion, financial analysts are scrutinizing yPredict’s offering and assessing its potential impact on <strong>crypto investment</strong> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-experts-predict-bright-future-for-this-ai-powered-crypto-platform-heres-why.htm">price prediction strategies</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/ypredict/en"><strong>Visit yPredict Here</strong></a></p>
<h2><strong>The Anatomy of yPredict&#8217;s Presale</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>yPredict is in the seventh stage of its 8-staged fundraising campaign with <strong>$4.47 million already raised</strong>. When the startup hits the $4.58 million milestone, the presale will advance to the final stage, shifting the token price from $0.10 to $0.11. </p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>To date, 80 million out of a total supply of 100 million tokens have been set aside for this presale. Upon reaching Stage 8, 21.875% of the total supply will go on sale, equivalent to 17,500,000 tokens valued at approximately <strong>$1.9 million</strong>. The ultimate fundraising goal for the presale is set at <strong>$6.5 million</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Beyond Crypto: yPredict&#8217;s AI-Infused Services</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The AI crypto offers a product suite that showcases the company’s AI vision, which includes tools for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-signals.htm">crypto signals</a>, technical analysis, and real-time sentiment analysis on popular cryptocurrency. Other products in the pipeline include yPredict Analytics, yPredict Repository, and yPredict Terminal.</p>
<p>After the presale ends, yPredict intends to release its analytics product, widening the scope of crypto investment and <strong>price prediction capabilities</strong>.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<h2><strong>How Does yPredict Stack Up?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>In an <a href="https://bitpinas.com/cryptocurrency/coingecko-2022-annual-crypto-industry-report/">industry valued at around $2.3 billion</a>, AI crypto projects are not scarce. What distinguishes yPredict is its relatively modest <strong>market capitalization goal of $6.5 million</strong>. </p>
<p>For context, several other AI-powered projects in the cryptocurrency sector are <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/ai-big-data/">valued between $50 and $100 million</a>. yPredict is also working on a rewards mechanism, planning to allocate <strong>10% of subscription revenues</strong> to a staking pool, potentially offering an annual percentage yield much higher than the industry average of 5-10%.</p>
<p>Token holders are expected to benefit in multiple ways, including discounted access to a range of platforms within the yPredict ecosystem, such as data repositories and analytical tools. Access to yPredict Analytics, which claims to <strong>predict cryptocurrency prices with “extreme precision,” </strong>requires a minimum token holding of $500.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">crypto presale</a> comes to a close and as the startup prepares to further entrench itself in the fields of crypto investment and price prediction, yPredict is potentially shaping up to be more than a regular player in the crypto startup scene. </p>
<p>It seeks to carve out a unique space at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, a move that is being closely watched by market analysts and prospective investors.</p>

Stock prices of Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and financial services firm Galaxy Digital all rose, with <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/press/microstrategy-announces-second-quarter-2023-financial-results_08-01-2023">MicroStrategy&#8217;s balance sheet already holding more than <strong>158,000 Bitcoin</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1716793529895198735"></oembed></figure><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitmain-invest-54-million-bankrupt-bitcoin-mining-company-core-scientific.htm">Bitcoin mining companies</a>, which are generally more susceptible to Bitcoin price fluctuations, are among the beneficiaries of this BTC price hike. Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) saw their stock prices go <strong>up by over 15%</strong>. Even the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq equity indexes snapped a five-day losing streak.</p><h2><strong>BlackRock and the SEC: A Pending Decision</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The expectations of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval have been brewing for some time, particularly after financial giants like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/23/blackrock-valkyrie-and-others-petition-sec-for-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock submitted their applications to the SEC</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;If Bitcoin&#8217;s rally extends as far as $40,000, there will be a significant shift in investors&#8217; outlook for Bitcoin,&#8221; said James Butterfill. He followed up with a <strong>note of caution</strong>. &#8220;Any detriment to the early &#8217;24 timeline for Spot ETFs could have a negative impact on prices and we could be trading in the high 20s again. Although, given recent events, this scenario seems increasingly unlikely.&#8221;</p><p>The market was quick to respond to the uncertainties surrounding the Bitcoin spot ETF. Following Butterfill&#8217;s cautionary remarks, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dips-3-minutes-as-dtcc-removes-blackrocks-ishares-bitcoin-trust-ticker-from-list-are-spot-btc-etf-approvals-at-risk.htm">BTC price experienced a 3% dip</a>, dropping from around <strong>$34,500 to $33,500</strong> in a matter of minutes due to the <strong>FUD</strong> (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) caused by the removal of BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares Bitcoin Trust ticker $IBTC from the <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/products/cs/exchange_traded_funds_plain_new.php">DTCC list on its website</a>.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/XCryptoPost/status/1716873105329827986"></oembed></figure><p>In light of these developments, it becomes clear that the cryptocurrency sector is not operating in isolation. A potential Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC could be a pivotal moment, not just for Bitcoin but for the entire industry. The recent price rallies in both Bitcoin and associated company stocks show that traditional financial markets are becoming more entwined with digital assets.&nbsp;</p><p>While the market response has been overwhelmingly positive, it has also proven to be fragile, given its swift reaction to even a hint of uncertainty.</p>

</figure>
<p>Today,<strong> Grayscale Investments</strong> announced a partnership with the UK-based global index provider <strong>FTSE Russell</strong> to introduce the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sector Index Series. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/grayscale-crypto-sectors-setting-a-standard-for-the-crypto-asset-class">The index hopes to bring clarity</a> to the fast-growing, yet often misunderstood crypto asset market by offering a <strong>structured framework</strong> for measuring the performance of different digital assets.</p>
<h2><strong>The Framework: Identifying Five Distinct Sectors</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-investments-partners-with-ftse-russell-roll-out-crypto-sector-index-series.htm">FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Index Series</a> have been classified into five distinct categories: <strong>Currencies</strong>, <strong>Smart Contract Platforms</strong>, <strong>Financials</strong>, <strong>Consumer and Culture</strong>, and <strong>Utilities and Services</strong>. </p>
<p>Each sector provides a lens through which investors can better comprehend the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency market</a>. Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell plan to reassess these sectors quarterly to keep pace with the dynamic crypto asset class.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>&#8220;Investors have increasingly expressed interest in diversifying beyond crypto&#8217;s largest assets &#8211; Bitcoin and Ethereum &#8211; and many look to Grayscale to better understand this robust, evolving asset class,&#8221; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/grayscale-launches-crypto-indices-partnership-with-ftse-russell-2023-10-24/">CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, currencies serve three main functions: they are a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mark-cuban-says-crypto-is-a-store-of-value-redditors-right-t-9087.htm">store of value</a>, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. Similarly, the <strong>Currencies</strong> sector in the index focuses on crypto assets that perform these functions, such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, Litecoin, and Ripple.</p>
<h3><strong>Role of Smart Contracts in Crypto</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Smart Contract Platforms</strong>, a key part of the crypto sector, have been gaining attention since <strong>Ethereum&#8217;s launch</strong> in 2015. These platforms have expanded the range of possibilities within the cryptocurrency market. They serve as the foundation for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp">decentralized applications</a>, which can range from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <strong>Uniswap</strong> to gaming environments like <strong>The Sandbox</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/5-projects-enabling-smart-contract-development-on-bitcoin.htm">Smart contract platforms</a> offer an edge <strong>against centralization</strong>, often leveraged by tech giants, by creating a decentralized environment that aligns the incentives between developers and users.</p>
<h3><strong>Financials: Liquidity in Crypto Economy</strong></h3>
<p>Another sector under the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors is <strong>Financials</strong>, focusing on applications that facilitate borrowing, lending, and trading of crypto assets <strong>peer-to-peer</strong>. These platforms often offer more efficient and <strong>cost-effective transactions</strong> compared to traditional financial services. </p>
<p>The Financials sector, in essence, provides the economic backbone to the crypto economy by facilitating liquidity and efficient capital allocation.</p>
<h3><strong>Consumer and Culture: From Art to Ownership</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Consumer and Culture</strong> sector covers applications that affect creative industries like entertainment, art, and media. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</a> are the driving force in this sector, offering new forms of ownership and changing how value is perceived in digital assets.</p>
<p><strong>Governance tokens</strong> are also part of this sector, facilitating decentralized decision-making processes within protocols or applications.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<h3><strong>Utilities and Services: The Core Elements of Crypto Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Utilities and Services</strong> sector is described as integral to the functioning of the crypto ecosystem. This sector includes applications that provide real-time connections to <a href="https://blockchainoraclesummit.io/oracles-as-a-catalyst-for-bridging-real-world-assets-on-chain/">real-world assets through oracles</a>, enhance asset liquidity through <strong>liquid staking solutions</strong>, and offer various consumer services through decentralized networks. These services help strengthen the overall crypto architecture, making it more robust and versatile.</p>
<p>Tokens in the Utilities and Services sector also enable investors to pool their resources, lowering the barriers for network participation. The sector includes other services like wallets, bridges, and payment systems, which are instrumental in <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/the-future-of-defi-integrating-traditional-finance-and-decentralized-finance/">integrating crypto applications with the traditional financial ecosystem</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact on Investment Strategies</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>The FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors index provides a reliable roadmap for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/four-investment-strategies-to-make-day-trading-less-risky-9024.htm">investment strategies</a> in the crypto market. For example, assets linked to smart contract platforms and the &#8220;Financials&#8221; sector could be of particular interest for those focusing on <strong>blockchain&#8217;s capability</strong> to streamline and advance traditional systems.</p>
<p>The new index could serve as an integral part of <strong>investment planning</strong> for those interested in the dynamism of crypto assets, offering timely information that adapts to the market&#8217;s volatile nature.</p>
<p>In short, Grayscale Investments&#8217; partnership with FTSE Russell to introduce the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sector Index Series represents a major step in structuring the crypto asset market. By categorizing crypto assets into distinct sectors and committing to regular updates, this initiative could provide investors with a reliable framework for understanding this complex and continually evolving asset class. </p>
<p>The indices also showcase the growing integration of crypto assets into the global financial system, marking them as more than a speculative investment but as components of broader economic structures.</p>

Skepticism also arose around the stability of its reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these setbacks, Tether displayed resilience. It managed to boost its token supply by nearly <strong>$18 billion</strong> this year alone, a feat attributable to a favorable market environment and the struggles faced by its rivals like <strong>Binance USD</strong> (BUSD) and <strong>USD Coin</strong> (USDC).</p><figure class="image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/news/126802/334837/d0dc2bfdb51f84915e8a9552a.jpg" alt="USDT Circulating Supply" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126802/334837/responsive-images/d0dc2bfdb51f84915e8a9552a___media_library_original_1575_863.jpg 1575w, https://cimg.co/news/126802/334837/responsive-images/d0dc2bfdb51f84915e8a9552a___media_library_original_1200_658.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/126802/334837/responsive-images/d0dc2bfdb51f84915e8a9552a___media_library_original_900_493.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/126802/334837/responsive-images/d0dc2bfdb51f84915e8a9552a___media_library_original_720_395.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/126802/334837/responsive-images/d0dc2bfdb51f84915e8a9552a___media_library_original_600_329.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126802/334837/responsive-images/d0dc2bfdb51f84915e8a9552a___media_library_original_300_164.jpg 300w" sizes="100vw" width="1575" class="content-img"><figcaption>USDT Circulating Supply Chart, <a href="https://messari.io/project/tether/charts/market/chart/mcap-circ">Messari</a></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this year, regulatory measures against its competitors further solidified Tether&#8217;s position in the market. The New York Department of Financial Services directed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-criticizes-secs-approach-staking-heres-what-he-said.htm">Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, to halt additional minting</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsequently, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-threatens-lawsuit-against-binance-busd-stablecoin-issuer-paxos-whats-going-on.htm">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission classified BUSD as a security</a>. These events led to a <strong>sharp decline in BUSD&#8217;s supply</strong>, falling from its peak of <strong>$22 billion</strong> in November 2022 <strong>to roughly $2 billion</strong> at present.</p><h3><strong>Market Dominance Bolstered by External Factors</strong></h3><p>Another competitor, <strong>USDC</strong>, faced issues when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/usdc-depeg-circles-43-billion-stablecoin-spotlight-as-silicon-valley-bank-exposure-revealed-heres-latest.htm">it was revealed to have exposure to the failed crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank</a>. Although the stablecoin recovered from a brief depegging, its circulation has consistently declined despite an improving market. Such circumstances contributed to <strong>Tether&rsquo;s surge</strong> to continued market dominance, with <a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins">DeFillama data showing it now commands nearly 70% of the market</a>.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1716451658199114201"></oembed></figure><p>Paolo Ardoino, Tether&#8217;s CEO, celebrated this achievement with an &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1716451658199114201">84B $USDt&#8221; post on social media platform X</a>.</p><p>In the broader context of cryptocurrency investment and market stability, Tether&#8217;s USDT achieving an $84 billion supply is more than just a milestone; it serves as an indicator of investor confidence in the stablecoin as a safe harbor, especially when rival options face regulatory and financial hurdles. This development may also reflect broader market sentiment, which is tilting toward optimism.</p>

Despite their critical role in the crypto economy, however, the <strong>United States is falling behind</strong> in stablecoin policy and global competitiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the <strong>Head of North America Policy at Chainalysis</strong> Jason Somensatto, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/23/the-us-risks-its-position-as-a-stablecoin-leader/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_campaign=headlines">about 60% of all stablecoin activity is now controlled by non-U.S. entities</a>, suggesting a sharp decline in American influence over this growing sector.</p><h2><strong>A Shift Away from U.S. Influence</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-market-cap-hit-nearly-3-trillion-by-2028-bernstein-report.htm">Stablecoins</a> are proving essential to the cryptocurrency market, accounting for roughly <strong>40% of all transactions</strong> on blockchain networks. This share has <strong>not been enough</strong> to motivate the United States to create a more competitive regulatory environment, however.&nbsp;</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/jasonsomensatto/status/1716475180766134592"></oembed></figure><p>Just a year ago, U.S.-based regulated companies were more actively involved, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/technology/crypto-firms-start-looking-abroad-as-us-cracks-down.html">recent trends indicate that this activity is shifting overseas</a>. According to <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/geography-of-cryptocurrency-2023.html">2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report</a> the majority of stablecoin transactions now occur through <strong>non-U.S. licensed services</strong> among the top 50 exchanges.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Consequences of Regulatory Inaction</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Somensatto emphasizes the importance of well-structured regulation for the stablecoin sector, particularly in terms of <strong>global and national security</strong>. For instance, the United States risks losing its ability to enforce critical measures around anti-money laundering and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/senator-warren-demands-action-against-crypto-funded-terrorism-following-hamas-attacks.htm">countering the financing of terrorism</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to security concerns, Somensatto argues that the United States faces <strong>economic repercussions</strong> if it continues to neglect the stablecoin sector. An uncompetitive regulatory environment could stymie the <strong>growth of businesses</strong>.</p><p>The U.S. could also miss the opportunity to <strong>reduce costs for consumers</strong> and lower borrowing costs for the government. Finally, by failing to establish a dominant role in the stablecoin market, the United States could also lose the advantages it currently enjoys from the <strong>dollar&#8217;s central role</strong> in international trade and finance.</p><p>A novel legislative effort, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12249#:~:text=The%20bill%20would%20establish%20a,could%20be%20banks%20or%20nonbanks.">the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act</a>, could serve as a promising approach to stablecoin regulation. This proposed legislation would set standards for reserve assets, empower the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> to conduct oversight, and mandate regular disclosures to consumers.</p><h2><strong>Stablecoins: Unique Risks and Rewards</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Stablecoins are fundamentally different from traditional payment methods due to their public <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/blockchain/">blockchain</a> network operation. Somensatto argues that stablecoins are neither riskier nor safer than traditional payment forms but do present <strong>unique risks and advantages</strong>.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1714348160011645391"></oembed></figure><p>While traditional banks are more difficult for regulators to supervise due to complex systemic risks, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/stablecoin">fully-backed nature of stablecoins</a> simplifies this process.</p><p>However, the same technology that simplifies oversight also presents new operational risks, indicating the need for specially tailored regulatory models.</p><p>In summary, while stablecoins have seen an explosion in transaction volume, surpassing even financial giants like Mastercard and PayPal, the United States is not keeping pace with this innovation in terms of policy and regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>With major economic and security implications at stake, this lack of action is concerning. The question now is whether the United States will adapt its crypto regulation strategy to fully leverage the potential of stablecoins in both the domestic and global financial systems.</p>

The project is called <strong>Launchpad XYZ</strong> and it&#8217;s capitalizing on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinmarketcap-launches-chatgpt-plugin-simplify-crypto-analysis.htm">artificial intelligence</a> to offer unique features for <strong>crypto investment</strong>.</p><p>In an ongoing LPX token presale, the crypto startup has successfully <strong>raised $1.93 million</strong> so far.

Here&#8217;s a straightforward guide to purchasing LPX tokens through Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s ongoing presale.</p><h3>Setting Up Your Digital Wallet</h3><p>Firstly, one needs a digital wallet that supports <strong>ERC-20 tokens</strong> to partake in the presale. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-wallet-review.htm">MetaMask</a> is the platform&#8217;s recommended choice, cited for its ease of use.&nbsp;</p><p>Downloading the app or browser extension from the <strong>MetaMask</strong> website and following the setup instructions should get you up and running.</p><h3>Funding the Wallet with Crypto</h3><p>After successfully setting up a <strong>digital wallet</strong>, the next action is to purchase and transfer cryptocurrencies into it. <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>USDT</strong> are among the tokens accepted by Launchpad XYZ. Credit card payments are also accepted during the presale, providing an additional avenue for investment.</p><h3>Linking the Wallet to the Presale Portal</h3><p>The third step involves connecting your digital wallet to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/en">Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s website</a>. Clicking the &#8216;<strong>Connect Wallet</strong>&#8216; option and following the subsequent directions will ensure the wallet becomes integrated with the platform&#8217;s presale portal.</p><h3>Completing the Token Purchase</h3><p>Once the wallet is connected, investors can then select their preferred crypto payment method and indicate how many LPX tokens they wish to buy. Keep in mind that transaction costs&mdash;commonly known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum-gas-fees-explained.htm">GAS fees</a>&mdash;will apply and should be factored into your investment calculations.</p><h3>Retrieving Your LPX Tokens</h3><p>The last part of the process is claiming the acquired tokens. Investors will have a <strong>seven-day window</strong> following the presale&#8217;s conclusion to do so. Launchpad XYZ will release additional instructions to guide token claims.</p><p>The approach of Launchpad XYZ offers a snapshot into the future trends in AI-driven crypto startups and Web 3.0 investment platforms. As the LPX token presale continues to capture both attention and capital, its utility and AI capabilities present a new angle to crypto investment options.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/launchpad/en"><strong><u>Visit Launchpad XYZ Now</u></strong></a></p><p><i><sub>Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

<p>As the cryptocurrency market navigates the last week of October, attention is focusing on several digital assets showing promising trends. </p>
<p>Among them, Fantom, Aave, and THORChain stand out for their promising fundamentals and/or bullish technical indicators. </p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know about some of the best cryptos to buy now, along with some alternative, lower market cap cryptos to consider.</p>
<p>Fantom is exhibiting resilience after<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fantom-foundation-faces-major-security-breach-67-million-lost.htm"> <u>a security incident on October 17 involving a hack of the project&#8217;s foundation wallet</u></a>.</p>
<p>Despite the breach, Fantom&#8217;s FTM price is currently witnessing a significant price appreciation from last week.</p>
<p>Aave’s price is also trending upwards. AAVE rallied to hit a price milestone, surging above $80 for the first time since July 14.</p>
<p>This positive momentum suggests AAVE may be positioned for<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/"> <u>further growth in the DeFi sector</u></a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, THORChain’s price achieved a new 24-hour record of over 100,000 swaps on October 20–highlighting its growing usage.</p>
<p>THORChain&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, RUNE, is currently climbing and has seen an increase of nearly 25% over the past week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cryptocurrency presales such as Bitcoin Minetrix and TG.Casino can also be attractive alternatives to investing in established cryptocurrencies if you’re looking to get in on the ground floor of a project.</p>
<p>This article will dive deeper into the technical analysis and fundamentals behind why these projects are gaining traction as the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<p>Up next, a closer look at the charts, tokenomics, and developments propelling these projects.</p>
<h2><strong>Fantom FTM Price Prediction: Will it Surpass the 100-day EMA?</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126775/334750/10-23-23-cn-ftm-chart.jpg" alt="TradingView chart for the FTM price 10-23-23" width="1815" />

</figure>
<p>The Fantom (FTM) price has been one of the better-performing cryptocurrencies over the past few days. After finding support around $0.17 on October 19, the FTM price is rallying by over 21% to current levels around $0.22.</p>
<p>FTM price is currently attempting to break out above resistance between $0.21 and $0.23. This area aligns with the 100-day EMA at $0.22 and the Fib 0.382 retracement level at $0.23.</p>
<p>If the FTM price can close decisively above $0.23 for the next few days, it would mark the first breakout above the crucial 100-day EMA since May of this year.</p>
<p>Pushing above this level would likely act as a bullish catalyst that could see the FTM price extend higher toward the next resistance zone around $0.25.</p>
<p>The daily RSI for the FTM price is currently at 73, up from yesterday&#8217;s reading of 67. This shows growing upside momentum as the RSI pushes further into overbought territory above 70.</p>
<p>The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is also trending higher above the zero line, underscoring building bullish momentum.</p>
<p>On the downside, the 50-day EMA at $0.20 should provide the first layer of strong support. As long as the FTM price holds above the 50-day EMA on a daily closing basis, the short-term uptrend remains intact.</p>
<p>However, a decisive breakback below $0.20 could signal a bearish continuation to the downside. In that scenario, the FTM price could decline back towards the recent swing low of around $0.17 before finding support.</p>
<p>For now, the path of least resistance appears higher but FTM needs to overcome resistance around $0.23 to maintain its upside momentum. A rejection at this level could lead to some consolidation between $0.20 and $0.23 over the following days.</p>
<h2><strong>AAVE Price Prediction: With a Surge Over 30%, Bulls Take Control of AAVE</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126775/334751/10-23-23-cn-aave-chart.jpg" alt="TradingView chart for the AAVE price 10-23-23" width="1815" />
<figcaption>Source: TradingView /<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AAVEUSDT/"> <u>AAVEUSDT</u></a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The AAVE price has also seen a dramatic turnaround over the past week, with the cryptocurrency surging over 30% after finding support between $61.46 and $62.97 on October 19. AAVE is currently trading at $83.37, up a notable 5.17% so far today.</p>
<p>Looking at the technical indicators, the AAVE price appears well-positioned for further gains in the near term. The 20-day EMA stands at $67.74, while the 50-day EMA is at $64.77.</p>
<p>With the faster 20-day EMA trending above the 50-day EMA, this creates a bullish alignment that often precedes additional upside.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp"> <u>relative strength index (RSI)</u></a> for AAVE is currently at 77.91, up from 75.6 yesterday. This shows the RSI continuing to climb further into overbought territory, reflecting the momentum behind the recent AAVE price surge.</p>
<p>However, with the RSI below 80, there still appears to be some room left for the rally to continue before becoming extremely overheated.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MACD histogram sits at 1.59, a widening gap from yesterday&#8217;s 0.97 level. This expanding positive value indicates the bullish sentiment is gaining further traction and could help lift the AAVE price higher.</p>
<p>In looking at volume and market capitalization, the market cap for AAVE now stands at $1.22 billion following a 12.54% increase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume has jumped 22.36% to $282.6 million. This rising interest adds credibility to the sustainability of this upside move.</p>
<p>With the AAVE price up over 5% today to $83.37, it is now attempting to break out above the Fib 0.786 level of $79.90. Pushing through this resistance could open the door towards challenging the horizontal resistance zone of $83.47 to $84.60.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support comes in at the Fib level of $73.52. Further support sits between $67.99 and $70.12, which aligns with the 50 Fib level at $69.04. With the AAVE price consolidating above these key levels, the technical picture remains constructive for additional gains.</p>
<h2><strong>THORChain RUNE Price Prediction: Bullish Signs Emerge as Traders Anticipate Further Upside</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<figure class="image"><img decoding="async" class="content-img" src="https://cimg.co/news/126775/334752/10-23-cn-rune-chart.jpg" alt="TradingView chart for the RUNE price 10-23-23" width="1814" />
<figcaption>Source: TradingView /<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/RUNEUSDT/"> <u>RUNEUSDT</u></a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The RUNE price has seen a resurgence in bullish momentum over the past week, with the token rising nearly 25% from its October 20 lows.</p>
<p>After finding support at the 100-day EMA, RUNE appears positioned for a breakout as technical indicators turn bullish once again. The RUNE price currently trades around $2.07, up over 13% so far today.</p>
<p>This puts the token above immediate resistance at the $1.914 to $2.027 zone, which coincides with the key Fib 0.786 level of $1.978.</p>
<p>With the RUNE price now back above the 20-day EMA of $1.736, the path of least resistance appears to be to the upside.</p>
<p>The bulls will look to take out the next area of resistance between $2.184 and $2.291. This zone lines up with the local high of $2.267, which if broken, could signal a resumption of the uptrend.</p>
<p>The technical indicators support the bullish thesis for RUNE in the short term. The RSI now prints at 66.41 versus 57.10 yesterday. This shows bullish momentum is accelerating with plenty of room to run before overbought territory.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MACD histogram sits at 0.007, up from 0.031. This illustrates that while bearish momentum has waned, there is now a building bullish momentum that could propel the RUNE price higher.</p>
<p>With signs pointing to further upside, traders may look to buy on dips back towards the breakout point around $1.95. Initial support aligns at the Fib 0.618 level of $1.749 followed by the horizontal zone of $1.666 to $1.731.</p>
<p>As long as the RUNE price can hold above these levels, the path of least resistance appears to be higher in the short term. A daily close above $2.30 would reinforce the bullish outlook and could open the door for a retest of RUNE&#8217;s YTD high.</p>
<p>The recent surge in well-known cryptocurrencies like Fantom, Aave, and THORChain has certainly captured investor attention. However, this increased focus often overshadows lower-market-cap alternatives that offer their own sets of opportunities. </p>
<p>Investing in lesser-known tokens like those offered in crypto presales, such as Bitcoin Minetrix and Launchpad XYZ, allows investors to enter projects at an early stage. This early entry can result in price appreciation upon wider market trading, offering a distinct route for portfolio diversification. </p>
<p>Up next, we examine how these alternative investments, particularly in the cloud mining and online gambling sectors, are attracting both retail and institutional investors.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span>
<p>Crypto presales provide an opportunity for investors to gain early access to new and promising crypto projects, often at a discounted token price before the assets are listed on exchanges.</p>
<p>By getting in early, investors stand to benefit from the potential price appreciation once the token is launched and traded more openly on the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Two ongoing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>crypto presales worth looking into in 2023</u></a> are Bitcoin Minetrix and Launchpad XYZ.</p>
<h3><strong>Tokenizing Mining Credits: Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s Game-Changing Approach Makes it Among Best Cryptos to Buy Now</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/why-bitcoin-price-can-surge-135000-while-bitcoin-minetrix-raises-2-million-could-2000x.htm"><u>The Bitcoin price recently started climbing again</u></a>, with some experts predicting it could reach $135,000 or even $750,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm"><u>new cloud mining project</u></a> called Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $2.1 million in its ongoing $BTCMTX token presale.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix seeks to redefine cloud mining by providing token holders with the opportunity to reap mining rewards, all without the need to manage hardware on their own.</p>
<p>The project utilizes blockchain technology to tokenize mining credits, distributing them to token holders based on their staked holdings.</p>
<p>This eliminates upfront payments and lock-in contracts associated with traditional cloud mining.</p>
<p>The presale is currently in stage three, with the token price set to increase in the coming days. Early contributors can benefit from the lowest pricing as Bitcoin&#8217;s bull run continues.</p>
<p>Stakers can also earn up to 275% APY by locking their tokens during the presale.</p>
<p>The project launches right before<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/"> <u>Bitcoin&#8217;s 2024 halving</u></a> when block rewards will decrease.</p>
<p>However, experts predict Bitcoin&#8217;s increasing scarcity and institutional adoption could outweigh the mining revenue reduction by driving the price higher.</p>
<p>With optimistic Bitcoin price targets up to $1 million, Bitcoin Minetrix could see exponential growth.</p>
<p>The project allows both retail and institutional investors to gain mining exposure without operational costs and risks.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>As the crypto bull run picks up speed, Bitcoin Minetrix offers a way to earn staking rewards today while also gaining leverage on Bitcoin&#8217;s growing price.</p>
<p>By combining staking and mining into one solution, it intends to provide the most direct path to capitalizing on Bitcoin&#8217;s next boom.</p>

<h3><strong>Crypto Casinos on the Rise: TG.Casino Taps into the $250 Billion Online Gambling Market</strong></h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency integration in everyday finance has shone new light on platforms providing access to decentralized, transparent online betting.</p>
<p>Telegram crypto betting bots, such as TG.Casino, are streamlining access to demonstrably fair games while enabling <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites.htm">anonymous crypto gambling</a> for users.</p>
<p>This pioneering approach is stirring up investor interest, as demonstrated by TG.Casino&#8217;s successful fundraising of over $1.4 million in its ongoing $TGC token presale.</p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>The presale for TG.Casino’s native token, $TGC, is structured around a dynamic “price ladder” that increases incrementally as milestones are met.</p>
<p>The current price is $0.1375 after starting at $0.125, with 57% of the next goal of $2.5 million achieved so far. As the price ratchets up over time, early buyers get the best deal.</p>
<p>According to the project’s website, $TGC holders receive a portion of platform profits through buybacks and staking rewards up to 362% APY.</p>
<p>A 25% cashback on net losses also incentivizes using $TGC for wagering. This model has proven effective for other gambling coins like Rollbit’s $RLB token, which briefly reached a $700 million market cap this year.</p>
<p>The global online gambling market is estimated to be worth over $250 billion, with crypto casinos claiming an increasing share.</p>
<p>Dune Analytics data shows<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ethereum-casinos.htm"> <u>Ethereum gambling sites</u></a> broke 50,000 cumulative users this year compared to just 5,000 in January.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-bitcoin-casinos.htm">ease of access and anonymity of crypto casinos</a> are attracting users from traditional platforms.</p>
<p>As the world’s largest messaging platform, Telegram is the perfect gateway for drawing new users into Web3 gambling.</p>
<p>TG.Casino eliminates the need for complicated crypto wallet setups or exchange signups. Users can simply interact with the bot interface to place provably fair bets.</p>
<p>With presale prices starting at just $0.125 per $TGC token compared to Rollbit’s peak of over $15, TG.Casino has ample room for explosive growth if it achieves similar success.</p>
<p>As Telegram expands its reach into Web3 platforms, the seamless experience offered by TG.Casino&#8217;s crypto gambling bot could propel adoption among the messaging app&#8217;s vast user base.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm"><u>Crypto investors keen on getting a head start in one-of-a-kind crypto initiatives</u></a> will find the current $TGC presale an attractive opportunity.</p>

It shows Fink&#8217;s high level of <strong>confidence in Bitcoin</strong>, especially following the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1411285">SEC&#8217;s recent engagement in constructive discussions with Bitcoin ETF issuers</a>.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/mikealfred/status/1716281633391968335"></oembed></figure><p>In linking <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s value to human freedom</strong>, Fink may be hinting at the broader <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/views/what-is-bitcoins-utility-and-why-should-people-care-about-it-4016621.htm">utilities of the cryptocurrency</a>. It&#8217;s not just a potential investment vehicle or a <strong>digital gold</strong>; it could serve as a mechanism for empowering individuals against financial systems that often work against their interests.</p><p>His comments suggest that he views Bitcoin as more than just a <strong>volatile asset class</strong>. Instead, it could be a tool that, in the right context, allows for a <strong>financial self-determination</strong> that is rare in traditional markets.</p><h2><strong>Bitcoin ETFs and Regulatory Conversations</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Fink&#8217;s comments are timely as they coincide with the <strong>SEC&#8217;s ongoing dialogues about Bitcoin ETFs</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, <strong>Bloomberg analysts</strong> Eric Balchunas and Seyffart have recently increased <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1363251?ref=74542344">the odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval to 90%</a>. They cite the recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-crypto-asset-management-firm-wins-lawsuit-against-sec.htm">court ruling in favor of Grayscale&#8217;s application</a> as a pivotal precedent.&nbsp;</p><p>Industry executives such as <strong>Mike Novogratz</strong> and <strong>Cathie Wood</strong> also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mike-novogratz-signals-bitcoin-etf-approval-could-secs-2023-agenda.htm">express the belief that a Bitcoin ETF is likely to receive approval this year</a>.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://twitter.com/Thecryptolord_/status/1716458523389734947"></oembed></figure><p>Another <strong>report from JPMorgan</strong> also indicates that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-application-approvals-likely-by-january-10th-jpmorgan-argues-how-high-can-btc-price-pump-2024.htm">the SEC is likely to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF within the next few months</a>. The analysis points out that the SEC&#8217;s decision not to appeal the recent court ruling in Grayscale&#8217;s favor brings the other pending applications, including BlackRock&#8217;s, a step closer to approval.</p><h2><strong>Market Response: Bitcoin Price Sees Positive Movement</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>The market seems to be taking note of the overall optimism surrounding Bitcoin and <strong>Bitcoin ETFs</strong>. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> has experienced a notable upswing, approaching the $31,000 mark. In the last 24 hours, <strong>Bitcoin has jumped 2.5%</strong>, and over the past week, it has surged by more than 10%. The current trading volume has increased by nearly 50% in the last 24 hours.</p><p>BlackRock&#8217;s Larry Fink is not alone in his bullish outlook for Bitcoin. The market, backed by favorable chart patterns and indicators, seems to be echoing the sentiment.&nbsp;</p>

This was its highest increase since mid-July. Also, its one-day trading volume rose dramatically, hitting $1.74 billion.</p><p>Bitcoin and the overall crypto market are also seeing gains, with Bitcoin back up to the high of $29,000, recovering the drop it saw earlier this week on false news of a Bitcoin ETF approval. The total crypto market cap is also rising by 2.75% so far today, back to $1.101 trillion.</p><p>The legal decisions surrounding Ripple are pivotal moments in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-obtains-default-judgment-against-david-chin-thor-technologies-for-offering-unregistered-securities.htm">ongoing dialogue between crypto entities and regulatory institutions</a>.

Nonetheless, STX still holds significant gains of 7.71% so far today as it trades at $0.6130.</p><p>The STX price technical indicators show a mix of bullish and cautious signals. The 20-day EMA stands at $0.5228 while the 50-day EMA is at $0.5093, with the STX price above both averages which is a bullish sign. However, the closeness of these EMAs indicates some volatility and uncertainty for the STX price.</p><p>The RSI is currently at 75, up from yesterday&#8217;s 68.42 and entering overbought territory. This suggests upward momentum is strong but could lead to a potential pullback.</p><p>The MACD histogram is at 0.0099, an increase from the previous day&#8217;s 0.0064. The growing positive value reflects a strengthening bullish sentiment.</p><p>With the STX price stabilizing above key support levels, technical indicators remain somewhat conflicted. The overbought RSI indicates potential for a pullback, but rising volume highlights growing conviction. Trading within defined risk limits while awaiting confirmation of a breakout past immediate resistance around $0.58 may be prudent.</p><p>A sustained move above the resistance zone between $0.5684 to $0.5856 validates upside potential, with the next test at $0.64.

BCH is currently trading around $241, up 6.12% on the day, as it attempts to overcome immediate resistance levels.</p><p>The 20-day EMA for the BCH price stands at $224.5, while the 50-day EMA is at $219.5. With the price well above these short and long-term EMAs, this indicates an established bullish trend for BCH. The widening gap between the EMAs shows gathering upside momentum.</p><p>The RSI is currently at 64.21, up from 55.15 yesterday. This shows decreasing bearish pressure and underscores the strengthening bullish sentiment. The RSI is not yet in overbought territory, signaling room for more gains.</p><p>The MACD histogram is now printing at 0.9, a reversal from yesterday&#8217;s -0.1 reading. This positive crossover suggests bullish momentum is accelerating for the BCH price.</p><p>BCH faces immediate resistance between $230 and $237.7, which aligns with the Fib 0.382 level at $237.7. With strong momentum today, BCH looks well-positioned to overcome this barrier. More significant resistance lies between $270.6 and $278, near the Fib 0.236 level of $272.6.</p><p>On the support side, BCH has its 20-day EMA of $224.5 holding as first support, followed by the 50-day EMA at $219.5. If BCH manages to hold above these levels, BCH&#8217;s bullish outlook will remain intact.</p><p>With Bitcoin Cash breaking out above key moving averages, bullish momentum gaining traction and oversold conditions reversing, the technical picture favors continuation higher for the BCH price.</p><p>Overcoming the initial resistance point around $237 appears achievable for the Bitcoin alternative in the near term.</p><p><i><sub>Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

Such a commanding presence indicates Uniswap&#8217;s leading role in elevating the DEX market, which recorded a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/unveiling-the-crypto-market-a-comprehensive-guide-to-exchange-activities-in-h1-2023">cumulative trading volume of $189 billion</a> in the same quarter.</p><h2>Uniswap Outpaces Centralized Giant Coinbase</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>A comparison between Uniswap and Coinbase further illustrates the changing dynamics. <a href="https://thedefiant.io/uniswap-spot-volume-surpassed-coinbase-in-2023">Uniswap&#8217;s performance has outpaced that of established centralized exchange Coinbase</a> throughout 2023.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/sameebuilds/status/1712311957594710226[/embed]<p>In Q2, 2023 Uniswap facilitated trades worth approximately $110 billion, while Coinbase trailed at nearly $90 billion. Even in the previous quarter, <a href="https://research.contrary.com/reports/uniswap-labs">Uniswap led with $155 billion against Coinbase&#8217;s $145 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>New Features and Community Reactions</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Beyond trading volume, Uniswap continues to enhance its platform. The upcoming <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4">v4 iteration of Uniswap will introduce features like &#8220;hooks,&#8221;</a> designed for greater customization in liquidity pools. The protocol is also consolidating all pools within a single contract to optimize gas usage.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-wallet-android">Uniswap has launched a closed beta Android version of its wallet</a>, with open-source code expected to be released soon.</p><p>However, it hasn&#8217;t been entirely smooth sailing. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-going-zero-uni-price-falls-6-as-new-swap-fees-go-live-new-crypto-project-raises-570000.htm">Uniswap recently adjusted its swap fees to 0.15%</a>, triggering mixed reactions within the community. Some users expressed dissatisfaction, which was seen as a major factor triggering the UNI token&#8217;s recent price crash.</p><h2>Why DEX Volume and Adoption Are On the Rise</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm">DEXs like Uniswap</a> continue to gain ground, several factors are contributing to this shift, from regulatory scrutiny and enhanced user experience to features and control over personal funds.</p><p>The user experience on DEXs has also notably improved, especially when it comes to swapping assets. With the maturation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cross-chain-partnership-between-swarm-and-wrapped-expands-defi-capabilities.htm">cross-chain technology</a>, these decentralized platforms are becoming more secure, transparent, and user-friendly. And of course, transactions can take place without the involvement of a centralized entity, a feature that resonates with the ethos of decentralization.</p><iframe title="CEX vs DEX: Which Crypto Exchange Is Better?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVyn07EmEAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>As well, the regulatory landscape for CEXs has tightened, as evident from recent actions taken by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hearing-date-set-for-binance-vs-sec-lawsuit-motions-ongoing-legal-battle-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">SEC against platforms like Binance</a> and Coinbase. In the wake of these regulatory developments, trading volumes on DEXs have surged. Users are moving towards decentralized trading platforms, which are generally perceived to be less susceptible to regulatory actions.</p><p>Another reason for the increased volume and adoption of DEXs is the focus on innovation. Decentralized exchanges are concentrating on providing better pricing and lower gas fees, among other user-centric features. By addressing challenges related to liquidity, user experience, and market fragmentation, DEXs are becoming increasingly attractive options for traders and investors.</p><p>An additional major advantage that DEXs have over CEXs is <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/251901/a-game-changer-emerges-discover-the-early-stage-crypto-dex-that-could-set-the-self-custody-revolution-ablaze">the control they offer users over their own funds</a>. One of the fundamental principles of blockchain technology is decentralization, an attribute that DEXs embody fully. Users can manage their assets without having to entrust them to a third party, unlike the custodial nature of centralized platforms.</p><p>In short, the surge in trading volumes and user adoption of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap can be attributed to a combination of factors.&nbsp;</p><p>While centralized exchanges are far from obsolete, the current trends suggest a dynamic and evolving cryptocurrency trading environment where the role of DEXs is becoming increasingly significant.</p>

This has raised concerns around duplication of efforts and increased complexity, however, as the various blockchain systems are often not interoperable.</p><p>La Salla noted that &#8220;the industry is graduating from this experimenting phase to how we work together.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitsliced-revolution-behind-asset-tokenization.htm">Asset tokenization</a> can simplify trading and post-trade settlement, while improving accessibility and liquidity in markets. The process involves representing real-world assets like company shares as digital tokens on a blockchain.</p><p>For example, Securrency&#8217;s technology could allow the creation of <a href="https://www.etfstream.com/articles/etf-tokenisation-game-changer-or-fad">ETFs as tokenized securities</a> that are traded and settled on a distributed ledger, rather than traditional market infrastructure.</p><p>This could streamline cumbersome aspects of today&#8217;s post-trade systems, including reconciliation and clearing of asset transactions. DTCC seems to be positioning itself to play a key role in the asset tokenization process as the technology gains more mainstream adoption.</p>

This aligns with the horizontal support zone spanning $0.149556 to $0.157733.</p><p>Traders may look to enter long positions on a successful resistance breakout while managing risk below the key support zone.</p><p>If RLB can maintain its bullish momentum, it could target the psychological $0.20 level next.

After failing to break past the 20-day EMA resistance at $0.04554, the XRD price is down 0.77% and trading at $0.04146.</p><p>With the XRD price below the 20-day EMA of $0.04554 and the 50-day EMA of $0.05075, the short and long-term outlook remains decidedly bearish. The widening gap between the 20 and 50-day EMAs also points to building downside momentum for the XRD price.</p><p>The RSI for XRD stands at 32.92, up slightly from 32.81 yesterday but still in oversold territory below 30. This suggests panic selling may be exhausting itself, but sustained upside still appears unlikely. A more prolonged RSI below 30 would be needed to signal a reversal.</p><p>The MACD histogram has improved slightly from -0.00050 to -0.00023, edging closer to a potential bullish crossover. However, follow-through will be required before this can be considered a reliable buy signal.</p><p>With the XRD price rejecting firmly from the 20-day EMA resistance at $0.04554, investors should watch for a retest of support levels. Immediate support lies between $0.03846 and $0.03938 where the current swing low is located.</p><p>A decisive break below this could open the door for a steeper decline towards the psychological $0.03 level. To negate the bearish outlook, the XRD price must show conviction above the 20-day EMA and the resistance zone between $0.04564 and $0.04782.</p><p>Until a bottom is confirmed, caution is warranted around the XRD price. Consolidation between support and resistance may persist in the coming days as traders evaluate the next catalysts.</p><p>Upside appears limited barring a spike in buying volume and breakout above the 20-day EMA.</p><h2><strong>Launchpad XYZ: Pioneering Web 3.0 Applications with LPX Token</strong></h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Web 3.0 crypto startup Launchpad XYZ is drawing attention for its forthcoming platform intended to streamline Web 3.0 applications.

The platform brings a functional focus to the dynamic cryptocurrency market as it offers a range of features including a decentralized exchange and exclusive access to high-value cryptocurrencies.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/launchpadlpx/status/1714959649244393821[/embed]<p>Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s emphasis lies on utility.

Users can access these benefits by staking LPX tokens for a minimum period of 90 days. This staking requirement serves the purpose of boosting token demand and covering associated fees.</p><p>To aid both new and experienced investors in crypto decision-making, Launchpad XYZ has developed a unique tool known as the Launchpad Quotient.</p><p>This<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-crypto-coins.htm"> <u>artificial intelligence-based system</u></a> compiles data from over 400 points to provide a nuanced view of potential crypto investments.

However, RNDR bounced off this level and has posted 4 consecutive daily gains since October 16.</p><p>This surge has allowed the RNDR price to break out above the previous resistance between $1.834 and $1.921. The cryptocurrency is seeing high trading volumes during this move, highlighting conviction amongst buyers. The RNDR price has also broken past its 100-day EMA, which currently stands at $1.687.</p><p>However, the daily RSI has diverged bearishly and reached overbought territory at 72.10, signaling the RNDR price may be due for a pullback after its short-term rise. The MACD histogram sits at a high of 0.13, reflecting building bullish momentum that could propel RNDR higher before it tops out.</p><p>Looking ahead, the RNDR price faces initial resistance between $2.128 and $2.245, aligned with the Fib 0.236 level at $2.165. Above this, RNDR would need to take out the psychological $2.50 area to extend its uptrend.</p><p>On the downside, the former resistance zone of $1.834 to $1.921 should now act as the first support region. A breakback below this would put the 20-day EMA at $1.770 in focus as the next key support.</p><p>The technicals suggest further upside may be limited for RNDR in the near term. Investors should watch for a pullback or consolidation before the uptrend resumes towards $2.50. Maintaining above $1.834 support will keep the bull case intact.</p><p><i><sub>Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

The topics that dominated the conversation were the strength of the labor market, ongoing inflation, and the Fed&#8217;s monetary policy.</p><p>The discussion held importance in light of the upcoming <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">Federal Open Market Committee</a> meeting scheduled for October 31-November 1.</p><h2>Inflation: The Balancing Act</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Jerome Powell&#8217;s remarks came at a crucial time when <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c59d1a0c-9cda-4749-9c5b-dd7691b46f0a">inflation in the US</a> has been a dominant concern.

Interestingly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-picks-up-august-wages-gains-slow-2023-09-01/">the unemployment rate has stayed stable at 3.8%</a> despite interest rate increases since March 2022. This defies expectations, as the economy has been performing above its anticipated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-lower-2023-08-30/">annual growth rate of 1.8%</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;The unemployment rate remains stable at 3.8%, showcasing an economy performing above the anticipated growth rate of 1.8% annually,&#8221; Powell commented.&nbsp;</p><p>He also flagged evidence of the labor market returning to pre-pandemic levels, however, suggesting that the market may be cooling.</p><h2>Financial Conditions: Market Reactions and Future Moves</h2><span class="replacer"></span><p>Powell drew attention to recent market developments, particularly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-federal-reserve-economy-interest-rates-79fdf75d519ec3d05c8dd485552834e3">the spike in bond yields</a>, suggesting that such increases have tightened financial conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Powell said, &#8220;Higher market-based interest rates could do the same job as Fed rate increases if sustained over time.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the Chairman was cautious about future policy measures, stating that the Federal Reserve is &#8220;proceeding carefully&#8221; in assessing the necessity for any additional rate hikes.</p><figure class="media">&lt;oembed url=&quot;https://twitter.com/_lenapetrova/status/1715049377478390059[/embed]<p>TradeStation Global head of market strategy <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/fed-s-powell-live-coverage-of-pivotal-speech-as-bond-yields-surge/card/powell-walking-middle-line-between-hawk-and-dove-strategist-VZ1tPPIymK15O5LGS8Vo">David Russell observed</a>, &ldquo;Jerome Powell continues to walk a middle line between hawk and dove.

The expectation is that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/personal-finance/2023/10/12/inflation-rate-update/">the benchmark policy rate will stay within the 5.25% to 5.5% range</a> for the upcoming meeting.</p><p>Subsequent to Powell&#8217;s speech, the stock market exhibited volatility with both gains and losses recorded. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s quantitative tightening measures and federal deficit outlook also prompted shifts in Treasury yields.</p><p>Overall, Jerome Powell&#8217;s discussion at the Economic Club of New York offered insights into the state of the US economy. It also provided an understanding of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s cautious stance toward policy changes, emphasizing its need to balance economic strength with prevailing concerns about inflation.&nbsp;</p>
