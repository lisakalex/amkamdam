<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating and innovative technology is finally starting to gain ground thanks to cryptocurrency. That concept is decentralized computing. To put it simply, decentralized computing is where complex computing tasks are chopped up into small pieces and sent out to thousands or more personal computers or servers to process and return. Once all the pieces are processed, the facilitating service puts them all together and the job is complete.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ac/735c910506.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5ac/735c910506.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5ac/735c910506.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5ac/735c910506.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5ac/735c910506.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5ac/735c910506.jpg 1254w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/suphakit73</figcaption></figure><p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to talk about what decentralized computing is, and how it fits into the modern and future cryptocurrency economy.</p><p><b>An endless need for more computing power</b></p><p>Today, there are a multitude of different types of businesses and research groups, like universities, that need tons of computing power. For example, companies that deal in 3D graphics (like the ones we see in television and movies today) all require computer power for rendering. Graphics rendering projects, depending on the complexity, can take hundreds or even thousands of hours, even with the most high-end computers available.</p><p>Universities engaged in medical research also require intense computing power to conduct their research. For example, the Stanford University program called Folding@Home has been running for several years now. The program allows for volunteers to run folding software on their computer. This software then receives small jobs and processes them before returning them to the network.</p><p>In the future, we are likely to see more companies and universities engaging in artificial intelligence (AI) research. AI research and testing is also very computationally intensive, and so universities typically need to own or have access to supercomputers.</p><p><b>How does decentralized computing fit in?</b></p><p>In order to process or provide all the necessary computing power for these resource intensive projects, companies and universities either need to invest millions upon millions of dollars into buying or building a supercomputer, or they need to pay high rates to cloud computing services. Cloud computing typically is a centralized service such as the one offered by Amazon.com with their Amazon cloud computing platform. On such platforms, a researcher, for instance, would send their unprocessed raw data to Amazon, and from there Amazon would process it and return it.</p><p>This kind of computing has opened doors for many, as it does not require the upfront costs of building a supercomputer. However, it&#8217;s not without its downsides.</p><p>First, it is still quite expensive. This is because there are not many cloud computing providers available, and so they have a huge control over the market.</p><p>Second, as these are centralized services, they are prone to attacks and have fewer individual points of failure.</p><p>Finally, as the services continue to consolidate, there could be fewer and fewer competing providers which would lead to even higher prices and worse service.</p><p>Distributed computing takes this paradigm in a completely different direction. Instead of sending the raw data to a centralized service, decentralized computing allows for thousands or more individual participants to receive and process jobs in exchange for payment.</p><p>This is where cryptocurrency comes in. In the past, it would have been unfeasible to pay thousands of participants for single job that may be worth a few dollars or so. This is because there may be more participants than there are units of currency, such as US cents. For instance, if a five dollar processing job is split up to 1000 participants, it&#8217;s not easy to split up that five dollars into 1000 increments of half a cent.</p><p>With cryptocurrency, something like that would be child&#8217;s play.</p><p><b>Distributed computing on the blockchain today</b></p><p>Today, there are a few different providers of distributed computing services that use cryptocurrency as an incentive for network participants.</p><p>One of those is called Render Token, or RNDR. Render Token is run by the Otoy group which is famous in the cloud rendering and GPU rendering services industry. Simply put, Render Token is a platform that is specifically for 3D graphics rendering. Participants on the network that complete jobs will be rewarded in RNDR tokens.</p><p>Remember the Stanford University Folding@Home program? While the program itself has no rewards, an enterprising group came up with a concept that they call Cure Coin. Those who register with Cure Coin and complete Folding@Home tasks can earn a daily payout of Cure Coins. Your coins can then be used to make purchases at some stores directly, or to exchange into another cryptocurrency like bitcoin on a supported exchange.</p><p>A few other players are in the marketplace as well, such as iExec which offers a general-purpose distributed computing platform, and is also based on Ethereum.</p><p><b>Distributed computing for the future</b></p><p>Distributed computing is a highly elegant solution to a complex problem. It allows companies and universities to get access to virtually unlimited computing resources, all without any upfront costs. Further, these networks are designed to be highly competitive and have no single point of failure.</p><p>Finally, much like cryptocurrency mining today, it may be possible that some people will want to set up their own distributed computing farms that run full-time in an attempt to earn steady income just by providing computing resources to a network. Someday, all this could be possible. But for today, we are still a little ways out from distributed computing taking over. And it almost certainly will, eventually.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a number of banks in the US and the UK that offer credit cards have halted all transactions being sent to known cryptocurrency dealers. However, for those who wish to purchase bitcoin on a credit card, there are still a multitude of options available that as of yet are not being affected by the declarations of these banks.</p><p>For instance, alternative credit card providers, online only banks, and credit unions appear to still be supporting bitcoin purchases with credit cards without any major issue.</p><p>Further, the three banks in the US &ndash;&ndash; J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup &ndash;&ndash; did again say that debit card purchases as well as direct bank transfer or ACH (Automated Clearing House) debit purchases would not be affected.</p><p>Moving past banks and credit cards, there will be a number of new cryptocurrency onramps that will come to exist this year. For instance, OmiseGo, which will launch later this year, is designed to allow for exchanges of fiat currency to cryptocurrency with no intermediary. Other services like Gems are launching a plan to offer cryptocurrency assets paid in exchange for completing tasks on a computer.</p><p>While these won&rsquo;t replace the traditional fiat to crypto route, they could help mitigate the losses until a more long-term solution becomes available.</p><p><b>Reasons for the ban</b></p><p>While banks are preventing transactions made from debit cards, they are doing so with credit cards for several reasons. According to an article that appeared on Bloomberg, the banks fear that bitcoin is an unreliable asset. Therefore, if large amounts of customers are financing the purchase of bitcoin through credit cards and bitcoin continues to drop in value, then the banks could be left with large amounts of bad debt.</p><p>Also in recent news, several credit card processors have been changing the way cryptocurrency purchases are coded. Specifically, purchases made on Coinbase have been changed from a purchase to a cash advance. Generally speaking, a cash advance is when an account holder uses an ATM to withdraw cash from their credit card. At many banks, cash advances come with additional fees or higher interest rates. This is presumably because banks do not want customers to withdraw cash from the credit card, and then use that cash to repay the credit card itself.</p><p>While it&#8217;s easy to say that the banks are being selfish or acting against the new technologies, it is conceivable that their complaints do have some degree of sense to them. If someone buys bitcoin on a credit card, and then sells that bitcoin shortly after, the result is essentially the same as getting a cash advance. The difference being that the fees paid to the credit card are different.</p><p>However, it&#8217;s not quite that simple. For instance, if someone were to use a credit card to purchase gold, diamonds, or other physical assets, then this is essentially the same as a bitcoin purchase. The difference being that bitcoin was designed to be a currency, whereas precious metals or gems were not.</p><p><b>The main issue</b></p><p>While some additional claims were laid out, such as a fear that stolen credit cards could be used to purchase cryptocurrencies, in which credit card providers would have essentially no recourse to recover lost funds, such claims were likely just secondary to the main issue. That being the case, banks simply don&#8217;t want to be involved with bitcoin. To them, bitcoin is bad news.</p><p>The CEO David Nelms said in a phone interview with Bloomberg that when it comes to bitcoin, &#8220;it&#8217;s crooks that are trying to get money out of China or wherever&#8221;, and later he added &#8220;Or if someone steals our credit card numbers they&rsquo;re going to ask for payments in Bitcoin. Those are the only use cases I&rsquo;m actually seeing today.&rdquo;</p><p>The banks are not completely saying no to cryptocurrencies, however, as Citigroup spokesperson Jennifer Bombardier said &#8220;we will continue to review our policy as this market evolves&#8221;. In other words, the door for crypto could reopen again sometime in the future.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unusual for the rest of the world, the Chinese government has always attempted &ndash; and largely succeeded &ndash; to control the uncontrollable. The liquidity of the internet is pervasive, but not in China. Alongside other tight controls on social media and online content, comes the new effort by the current regime to stamp out cryptocurrency trading.</p><p>Last year, the Chinese government made all domestic ICO (Initial Coin Offering) activity illegal, warned citizens not to participate in foreign ICOs, and ordered all local crypto exchanges to shut down. Now, the Chinese regime is set to enforce a nationwide ban on citizens trading cryptocurrencies offshore.</p><p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) stated that in order &ldquo;to prevent financial risks, China will step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs&rdquo;. The ban will entail blocking foreign websites that facilitate trading, as well as tightening up on entities promoting offers or trading in any way within the country.</p><p>Donald Zhao, a stand-alone trader who left Beijing for Tokyo as the local ban came into effect late in 2017 told South China Morning Post, &ldquo;It is common for people to use VPNs (Virtual Private Network) to trade cryptocurrencies, as many exchange platforms have relocated to Japan or Singapore.&rdquo; The new move means it would be even harder to circumvent the ban in China, while anyone promoting related business programs may be arrested, according to Zhao.</p><p>Ads for virtual currencies have already been discontinued on Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine. The local social media platform Weibo has also binned any promotion or depiction of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>But what is the Chinese experience after last year&rsquo;s bans?</p><p><b>Life finds a way</b></p><p><u>ICOs</u><br>
When an order to halt ICOs was first initiated, many in China immediately suspected this would be the first part of a multi-stage shutdown. Normally, when the Chinese government wants to make something complex illegal, it will not immediately outlaw the entire thing.</p><p>However, the Chinese have admitted that ICOs and virtual currency trading did not completely withdraw from the country following the official ban &ndash; many people turned to overseas platforms.</p><p><u>Buying/Selling crypto</u><br>
Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges are still operated locally in China. The reason why they were able to continue is that they completely relocated their operations to Hong Kong or another similar location.</p><p>Hong Kong is part of China, but it operates under significantly different laws. This is through a policy known as one country, two systems. Therefore, the laws requiring the shutdown of exchanges did not apply there. And so today, exchanges like Binance, Kucoin, and Huobi continue to be widely successful and accepted by traders all over the world.</p><p>For those wishing to buy and sell cryptocurrency for Chinese RMB, services like localbitcoins.com offer an easy way to do this. The service typically works in conjunction with Alipay (or WeChat pay), which is a mobile banking app that allows instant transfers with no fee through a mobile phone. In this way, Bitcoin trades can be made safely and instantly thanks to localbitcoins.com and its escrow and reputation tracking service.</p><p><u>Mining</u><br>
China is also often thought of as a location for the centralized factory mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At this point, the Chinese government has not directly made mining illegal. While they have taken some steps to rein in electricity usage in areas such as Sichuan province, the practice still continues generally unabated to this day.</p><p>Additionally, individual or hobby miners that mine out of their own homes are unaffected, as they are simply too small to appear on the radar. In either case, more and more Chinese miners are looking for new countries to relocate their business, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/the-great-migration-of-bitcoin-miners-to-canada-1180.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by <i>Cryptonews.com</i></a>.</p><p><u>Capital flight </u><br>
While most Western countries seem only interested in taxing income made through cryptocurrency investments or salaries, China seems to have another concern entirely. Last year saw the enactment of significant capital flight laws.</p><p>Capital flight laws are financial regulations that are designed to limit the flow of money from domestic to international accounts or sources. Basically, it aims to slow down the speed at which money can leave the country. In China, it is quite common for wealthy people to leave the country and move to greener pastures. Understandably, these wealthy people want to take their money with them.</p><p>The country has also been actively shutting down various loopholes such as using a debit card in a foreign country to buy luxury items, and then return them in exchange for cash.</p><p>While the government has not explicitly said so, it is obvious that cryptocurrency poses a potential capital flight risk.</p><p>***</p><p>What&rsquo;s next? It looks like the government is aiming to tighten regulations further on the crypto world. Li Lihui, former president of the Bank of China, one of the largest state-owned commercial banks in the country, told South China Morning Post, &ldquo;regulators will certainly step in&rdquo;, if any kind of financial innovations infringe upon the interests of consumers and affect the stability of the financial market. But will the crypto community find its way again?</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase, one of the most popular crypto exchanges that allows people to purchase bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash has finally announced that they will soon be implementing SegWit. Coinbase is quite late to the party, however, as the SegWit upgrade has been available for quite some time already. Many in the cryptocurrency world have accused Coinbase of being largely responsible for the large backlog of unconfirmed transactions seen recently, due to their insistence on not implementing SegWit promptly.</p><p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to go over briefly what SegWit is, and what this news could mean for the cryptocurrency world as a whole.</p><p><b>What is SegWit?</b></p><p>SegWit, also known as segregated witness, is an upgrade that was done to the bitcoin network last year. It allows for transactions to be done with a much smaller size, and therefore have much lower fees.</p><p>A large number of bitcoin exchanges and wallets have already upgraded to include SegWit, but the upgrade is still not universal across the network. Other cryptocurrencies that are based on bitcoin, such as Litecoin and Vertcoin, have already instituted SegWit on a broad scale and consequently fees on those networks are significantly lower.</p><p>In recent months, the pool of unconfirmed transactions on the bitcoin network has been growing to astounding levels, often exceeding 400,000 transactions. While that seems to have cooled off in recent days to about 8,000 at press time, it is still a potentially recurring problem that could come back at any time.</p><p>If a major exchange that a large majority of cryptocurrency users use, such as Coinbase, switches to SegWit, we could see many tens of thousands or more unconfirmed transactions disappear from that list during peak activity periods.</p><p><b>Bitcoin Block Space Essential To Network Speed</b></p><p>As each bitcoin block is only 1 MB in size, keeping transaction sizes as small as possible becomes essential. As SegWit allows for transactions to be smaller, they consequently consume less space.</p><p>To visualize this issue, think of a subway car in which 100 people all want to get on at the same time. If everyone has a backpack and a big puffy coat on, fewer people will be able to fit on the train overall. SegWit, in this example, is essentially like having all those people not bring their backpacks and heavy coats so that more people can fit on the train at once.</p><p>Another important change could be that Coinbase users, when making withdrawals from their Coinbase accounts, could see much lower transaction fees when withdrawing or sending bitcoin. We checked and as of this writing, a withdrawal of 0.05 BTC would cost about USD 2.80, which is still significantly higher than withdrawing Litecoin or Ethereum from Coinbase.</p><p>Coinbase Vice President and GM Dan Romero notes that the upgrade should &ldquo;help reduce the fees customers pay on bitcoin transactions.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Why so slow to upgrade?</b></p><p>Many in the cryptocurrency world are asking why Coinbase took such a long time to even consider implementing SegWit. Case in point, even to this day they still have not successfully enabled SegWit. </p><p>Specifically, in the official Coinbase blog, Romero writes:</p><p>&ldquo;We store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of customers and any change to our infrastructure is done with significant planning and consideration for the security and stability of our platform.&rdquo;</p><p>It should be noted that to this day, Coinbase has still not been successfully hacked, therefore their approach to security made still be laudable, if inconvenient for users.</p><p>No matter the motivation, this comes as good news for all users of Coinbase, as well as bitcoin users in general. This is because even if you do not use Coinbase, Coinbase represents such a large portion of bitcoin transactions that its use of SegWit could increase the efficiency of the network overall.</p><p><b>Batching Still Desperately Needed</b></p><p>While SegWit is a positive step forward for getting transaction sizes and fees under control, it is not by itself a complete solution. Many in the cryptocurrency community have been asking Coinbase to begin batching it&rsquo;s transactions.</p><p>In simple terms, batching transactions means that Coinbase should combine many outgoing transactions together, so that fees are lower, and the network suffers from less stress.</p><p>Perhaps a three-punch combo of SegWit, batching, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/4-influential-cryptocurrency-projects-1124.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Network</a> are really needed in order to fully address the scaling issues we are seeing today. While the move to implement SegWit is a great start, still more work will need to be done down the line.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2018 has a number of exciting innovations that might be going live this year. Some of these could potentially change the entire way we interact with cryptocurrency today. They could also impact our financial lives in a far more direct way than we have ever seen before. Today, we will be going over a few of these exciting projects.</p><p><b>Lightning Network</b></p><p>One of the biggest concerns facing the cryptocurrency world is the rapid growth of transaction fees, and the constantly increasing transaction times. Things have gotten so bad in the last few months that the list of unconfirmed transactions on the bitcoin network has at multiple times exceeded 200,000 transactions. At press time today things have cooled down, and the current amount of unconfirmed transactions stands at around 36,000.</p><p>Transaction fees have also increased alongside the competition for space in each block. According to the popular Exodus wallet, which allows for the storage of many different blockchain assets, the outgoing fee to send 0.1 bitcoin recently was USD 72. A few weeks ago, that amount was more than USD 200.</p><p>While lower fee transactions can be processed, they risk getting stuck and taking hours, days, or even weeks to fully process. During the peak of the fees, a bare minimum fee of USD 30 was required to even stand a remote chance of your transaction going through.</p><p>The solution to all of this could be Lightning Network. In a nutshell, Lightning Network is a second layer solution that will eventually allow for near instant, and near free transactions. If everything goes as planned, then transactions could be completed for less than one cent and confirmed nearly instantly.</p><p>Aside from the time and cost savings, this kind of change to bitcoin could fundamentally change how people interact with the cryptocurrency. It could be the essential key for allowing bitcoin to finally achieve widespread adoption.</p><p>Many cite the example of buying a cup of coffee with bitcoin. They say that now, this is simply impossible because the fees would almost certainly be more than the actual item itself. As well, it would take far too long to confirm.</p><p>While there is already a lot written about Lightning Network, it&#8217;s difficult to state in clear enough terms how important the Lightning Network could be not only for bitcoin, but all of cryptocurrency as a whole.</p><p><b>OmiseGO</b></p><p>With its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) completed last year, OmiseGO quickly became a billion-dollar asset due to not only what the project promised, but who the team is that represents it.</p><p>OmiseGO is an Ethereum platform based ERC-20 token that promises to become the ultimate peer-to-peer exchange platform for almost any kind of asset or value. This could include fiat currency, cryptocurrency, rewards points, mobile phone minutes, and almost any other digitally traded form of value.</p><p>The system will make use of a proof-of-stake consensus model that will encourage people to purchase, own, and operate OmiseGO network nodes. This will allow for a highly distributed and decentralized business model which is very different from the current centralized mining paradigm for bitcoin.</p><p>OmiseGO is being developed by the Omise company which is a southeast Asia based credit card and payment processor. They have recently made major deals with large corporations such as McDonald&#8217;s Thailand among others.</p><p>Their current network processes billions of dollars in value each year. While the group has not explicitly said so, it is reasonable to assume that eventually, the OmiseGO company will one day start putting its traditional credit card processes on the blockchain for lower fees and higher security. Asset prices of OmiseGO have increased significantly from its launch price of around six dollars to a high of USD 25.</p><p>If OmiseGO is fully successful in their plans, it could have a broad impact not only on cryptocurrency, but on the financial world as we know it, and ownership of an OmiseGO node could prove to be a solid source of income in the future.</p><p>In addition to its business model, OmiseGo will make use of Plasma technology, which can be thought of as a Lightning Network for Ethereum. Plasma is being developed by the same team behind Lightning Network.</p><p><b>Ethereum Casper (proof of stake)</b></p><p>Since the launch of Ethereum, it has been based on a proof of work consensus model. This means that miners need to purchase expensive mining hardware and run them 24 hours a day in an attempt to win blocks.</p><p>Proof of work mining has been accused of being wasteful not only in energy, but also in computer parts investment. While many experts, such as Andreas Antonopoulos would argue this point, it is true that proof of work mining is costly.</p><p>According to the Ethereum foundation, this year will mark the beginning of Ethereum switching from purely proof of work to become purely proof of stake. This could have far-reaching consequences to not only the value of a unit of ether, but also for the economics of miners who have already purchased GPU mining hardware.</p><p>Soon to be former Ethereum miners will likely switch to a different cryptocurrency that allows for GPU mining. For example, they may switch to Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Bitcoin Gold, or any other GPU mineable cryptocurrency.</p><p>This sudden shift of mining hash power away from Ethereum could significantly change the dynamics of how various block chains are valued. For example, if thousands of miners switch to Ethereum Classic, prices for ETC units could shift either up or down.</p><p>Economics aside, the switch of such a major blockchain to proof-of-stake could encourage others to follow suit. For example, although extremely unlikely, perhaps one day bitcoin or a major bitcoin fork could switch to proof-of-stake for its consensus model if Ethereum is highly successful in doing so.</p><p><b>Cash loans for crypto collateral</b></p><p>Up until this year, the only way to realize profits from a cryptocurrency investment was to either find a way to spend it directly or to sell it for cash. The problem with this is that if one is required to spend or sell their assets, then they could potentially miss out on a major upswing in value.</p><p>The previously mentioned bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos said on Twitter that he would have had a larger stash of bitcoin had he not been forced to sell it years ago in order to pay rent.</p><p>This year, a number of companies and projects are launching or have already launched that will allow for users to deposit cryptocurrency into an account, and then receive a low interest cash loan with the cryptocurrency used as collateral.</p><p>What this means is that if the borrower fails to repay, their cryptocurrency assets will be liquidated. In this way, lenders are able to offer much lower interest rates because loans are backed by collateral instead of just credit scores.</p><p>Each individual loan service has its own unique business model, so it&rsquo;s difficult to say which one is inherently better than the others. Instead, those seeking loans should consider the offerings of each platform before deciding which one to use.</p><p>A few examples of this type of business include Salt Lending, Ethlend, and Celsius Network. More businesses of this type are likely to come as this business model proves to be successful.</p><p><b>More to look forward to</b></p><p>2018 is gearing up to be one of the biggest years in cryptocurrency news. These four upcoming projects and ideas are just a few of the many in development. Soon people will be able to see a doctor, find love, rent an apartment, and report a crime all using blockchain technology, and this is all just the beginning.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This form of theft will continue in the future
Not only IOTA is a target
There are three ways to stay safe</p><p>The increasingly popular cryptocurrency known as IOTA has seen a large sum of money stolen almost overnight. This was not the result of a flaw in the network or wallet, but instead was the result of social engineering. In order to create an IOTA wallet, one must first generate an 81-character so-called &ldquo;seed&rdquo;. Typically, users rely on easily accessible websites to quickly generate the seed. In this case, the thief was able to compromise a seed generating website, and collected many hundreds or even thousands of seeds. Starting on sometime around January 19th, the seeds were emptied of their value en masse.</p><p><b>Understanding IOTA seeds</b></p><p>In order to not fall victim to this type of scam, we need to understand what an IOTA seed is, how it is made, and then of course how to avoid using a bad seed.</p><p>Users of other cryptocurrencies and wallets will most likely be familiar with the concept of 12-word seed phrase. This phrase is used to secure the wallet, and anyone who has access to it has access to everything in the wallet. Typically, most wallet programs will generate a new phrase for you. When people started to use IOTA, many were confused about how the seed phrases in IOTA worked.</p><p>Instead of relying on 12 random English words, IOTA relies on an 81-character string of capitalized letters and the number nine. The standard IOTA wallet does not generate this for you, and so users need to generate it themselves. This is where the problem likely springs from. Most people just want to start using their wallets, and don&#8217;t want to put a lot of thought into security.</p><p>In order to assist new users with generating IOTA seeds, a number of open-source and transparent websites have been created by the community to help people make seeds quickly.</p><p>There are also downloadable tools that produce the same result. These types of seed generating tools, be it online or downloadable, have become an indispensable resource for the IOTA community. That is partly why this theft was so insidious and effective.</p><p><b>Avoiding the scam</b></p><p>It&#8217;s quite conceivable that an attack like this will happen again in the future. Fortunately, it&#8217;s very easy to defend yourself from it.</p><p>Ideally, there are three main ways that you could generate IOTA seeds securely.</p><p><b>The easiest way</b> to do that is to use an online seed generator as normal. However, instead of using the seed exactly as provided, you go in and manually change some of the letters and numbers in different parts of the seed. For instance, if your seed starts with &ldquo;ABCEF9&rdquo;, you can change some of letters to something like this &ldquo;DBCG9F&rdquo;. Repeat this in a few different sections of the seed for added security. This way, even if the website is hacked or was designed to save the seeds it generates, they will still end up with nothing as the seed you are using is different.</p><p><b>The next way</b> to generate a secure status to simply do it completely by yourself. This means typing in a string of letters and numbers on your keyboard and counting up to 81 characters. While this method may be the most time-consuming, it is arguably the most random, and therefore the most secure. For those who need to generate a large number of individual addresses, however, it would probably not be ideal due to the amount of work involved.</p><p><b>Finally, the most secure method</b> to generate a large number of seeds quickly is to use a shell script, or to run a very simple Python program which anyone can create through cutting and pasting a few lines of code. This one does require a little bit of technical skill, so do keep that in mind. Searching online, we found two such programs that generate the seed securely and without meaning to touch the Internet at all. As these programs are so short, they are extremely easy to verify their security. For your convenience, we are posting them below with credit to their original creators.</p><p><b>Python:</b><br>
from random import SystemRandom<br>
alphabet = u&#8217;9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&#8217;<br>
generator = SystemRandom()<br>
print(u&#8221;.join(generator.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(81)))<br>
(code by phx)</p><p><b>Windows batch (.bat) file:</b><br>
@PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command &#8220;Invoke-Expression -Command ((Get-Content -Path &#8216;%~f0&#8217; | Select-Object -Skip 2) -join [environment]::NewLine)&#8221;&amp;&amp;pause<br>
@exit /b %Errorlevel%<br>
# script goes here and below&#8230;.</p><p>param( [int] $len = 81, [string] $chars = &#8220;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ9&#8221;)<br>
$bytes = new-object &#8220;System.Byte[]&#8221; $len<br>
$rnd = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider<br>
$rnd.GetBytes($bytes)<br>
$result = &#8220;&#8221;<br>
for( $i=0; $i -lt $len; $i++ ){ $result += $chars[ $bytes[$i] % $chars.Length ] }<br>
$rnd.Dispose()<br>
$result<br>
(code by 5mincoffee)</p><p>How these miniature programs work (the Python version, at least) is simply assigning the possible set of characters to a variable, then telling the your computer to use a randomizer function to choose any one individual times from the available pool. Again, these are completely secure because they do not rely on anything besides your own computer.</p><p><b>Not only IOTA is a target</b></p><p>This form of seed theft will continue in the future, and it will not only target IOTA. In this case, IOTA is particularly weak to this kind of attack due to the nature of how it&#8217;s wallets are designed to not provide seeds.</p><p>Recently, someone bought a hardware wallet on eBay, and was provided with a new seed phrase for the wallet to use straight out-of-the-box. What was done here, is that the seller had pre-set up the device with the seed phrase, kept a copy of it, and then sold the device to an unsuspecting buyer. </p><p>Once the buyer had loaded up the device with cryptocurrency, the nefarious seller used the 24 for word phrase to initialize another device, and then had full access to all assets on the device. In total, about USD 30,000 worth of cryptocurrency was stolen.</p><p><b>Conclusions and thoughts on safety</b></p><p>One of the most difficult things to understand for people new to cryptocurrency is that ensuring the safety of your assets is entirely up to you, the holder. If your assets are lost, there is no bank, law enforcement agency, or other central authority that can help you get them back. Once they are taken, they are gone forever. </p><p>Therefore, it is your duty to ensure that you fully understand the basic concepts of the technology, such as heresy phrases and private keys work, before investing large sums of money. It&#8217;s unfortunate however that humans by nature are quite lazy and always want the quickest and easiest solution. </p><p>It is this group of people that thieves and hackers will gleefully target for as long as they exist.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With 2017 over and 2018 upon us, many experts and commenters in the blockchain community are coming forward with predictions about what we could encounter this year. A number of these voices are saying that many altcoins will soon be disappearing from the market or lose all their value.</p><p>Is there any truth to this sentiment? In this article, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at the future of altcoins, and the potential validity of the idea that most of them will be gone eventually. The site deadcoins.com lists hundreds of such supposedly failed projects from years past. </p><p><b>Why do some altcoins fail?</b></p><p>Back in 2013, there were only about 40 cryptocurrencies to choose from. Today, there are thousands, and that number is growing every day. 2018 will likely see another wave of new cryptocurrencies hitting the market. </p><p>When considering what caused the death of an altcoin, we need to consider a few factors. That being price, market capitalization, community support, and development. It&rsquo;s safe to call the cryptocurrency dead when all four of these factors point to such a conclusion. </p><p>For an example of what is essentially a dead coin, let&rsquo;s look at BBQ coin. Launched sometime around 2013, BBQ coin was once listed on coinmarketcap.com and had a price of USD 0.29 each. It had a total market cap of around USD 8 million at the end of 2013.</p><p>The currency had its own web page, sub-Reddit, and development team. Fast forward to today and almost no trace of the coin can be found. It is no longer listed on coinmarketcap, it&rsquo;s sub-Reddit has seen no new posts in three years and its homepage has been taken over. By these definitions, we can consider this currency to be effectively dead. What was it created for originally? According to its archived homepage, &#8220;just for fun&#8221;.</p><p><b>Is a large scale altcoin crash coming?</b></p><p>As the rate of cryptocurrencies coming out now is so rapid, and valuations of many of them are purely based on speculation, it&rsquo;s conceivable that a crash could be on the horizon.</p><p>It&rsquo;s likely that such a crash could be similar to the great video game crash of 1983. The cause of the crash was too many low-quality products entering the market too quickly. The same could be said for cryptocurrency as many projects are popping up without much guidance, forethought, or innovation, and are just attempting to get as much cash as possible before disappearing.</p><p>Are all altcoins doomed? The answer to that, most likely, is no. While a lot of the ones we see today probably will not exist in a few years, there is still a lot of room in the cryptocurrency field for a wide range of niche cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos suggests in one of his talks, many of these currencies will find homes in very specific niche markets and use cases. The ones that don&#8217;t survive will be left for the history books.</p><p><b>How can a new currency survive today?</b></p><p>In order to compete in today&#8217;s extremely competitive cryptocurrency market, new assets and smaller blockchains need to be competitive and need to have a compelling reason for existing. Making a new altcoin just for fun is simply not enough anymore. Additionally operating as only a means of exchanging value is not enough, either. </p><p>Quite a few projects are appearing where they claim to be the bitcoin of a certain market. For example, a large number of cryptocurrencies have appeared that claim to be the bitcoin of adult entertainment. However, all that these cryptocurrencies are offering is essentially the same as bitcoin, but without the brand recognition, support, or technology and platform innovations.</p><p>There is no incentive for any specialized industry to take on an entirely new and untrusted payment method simply because it was aimed at them by a developer.</p><p><b>Innovation is essential</b></p><p>Conversely, a number of blockchain projects are appearing today that not only act as a medium of exchange, but also use their technology in exciting and innovative ways.</p><p>For example SALT tokens are used for an innovative lending platform, Golem tokens are used to power distributed computing, OmiseGo is used for a distributed peer to peer exchange, and so on.</p><p>We have also seen a growing number of privacy-centric tokens like Monero and PIVX that allow for anonymous exchanges of value, something that bitcoin is not able to do currently.</p><p>History tells us that to stay alive, an altcoin needs to innovate, be unique, have regular development, and service a real need or use case. We&rsquo;ve seen a number of projects that match this description nicely, as well as many that don&rsquo;t. It is this author&#8217;s opinion that projects that meet this need will stay alive for the foreseeable future. Those that don&rsquo;t? The history books are waiting for their pages to be filled.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you think of smart contracts, you probably think of Ethereum. However, a number of alternatives have appeared in the last few years. Some of them have even been gaining significant traction. Some have even been called the &#8220;Ethereum of China&#8221; or the &#8220;Ethereum of Japan&#8221;. Others have been progressing and seeing their development occur quietly, slowly but surely building their fanbases. </p><p>Ethereum, and its native asset, Ether, have both exploded in popularity and value in recent months. This is because more businesses are discovering how they can make use of the Ethereum blockchain and its smart contract capabilities. From banking and finance, to AI-driven dating and telemedicine, Ethereum is proving itself to be infinitely capable.</p><p>Now, we&#8217;re going to look into some of the alternatives in today&#8217;s article. We chose them based on a combination of their community support, developer interest, documentation, and valuation of their related assets. </p><p>By the way, if you&rsquo;re not very familiar with smart contracts yet, here is a short introduction before we begin:</p><blockquote class="left"><p>One of the most important developments in the blockchain space has been what&rsquo;s known as smart contracts. Smart contracts essentially mean simple computer programs that exist on a blockchain, and that can execute code (or contracts) automatically. Smart contracts have become the core feature of dozens of blockchain projects, and represent one of the biggest growth areas in the cryptocurrency field. </p></blockquote><p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to start:</p><p><b>NEO</b></p><p>Originally called AntShares, this platform is sometimes called the &#8220;Ethereum of China&#8221;. It is funded and operated in conjunction with Bitmain, the Chinese company that manufactures the majority of the worlds bitcoin mining hardware. Some examples include their Antminer series, such as the popular S9. <br>
While NEO has attracted the imaginations of many, and there are currently several applications running on the platform, some have suspected that NEO is in fact highly centralized, and has built-in backdoors for government agencies in the event that they decide to intervene. This so far has only proven to be conjecture, but it has also not been proven false. Bitmain&#8217;s Antminer famously contained such a backdoor known as Ant Bleed, which was discovered and patched.<br>
Others have accused NEO of simply being a copycat and not offering anything new. While those behind NEO would disagree, it is fairly obvious that they were attempting to cash in on the success of Ethereum by making a very similar, if not identical product.<br>
Lastly, the developers have been accused of acting in a greedy way because they hold the vast majority of all tokens. This is significantly different from other Ethereum competitors that have either distributed or sold the majority of their network tokens.<br>
Despite all the concerns surrounding NEO, tokens have been recently trading for up to USD 160, after staying in the USD 30s for quite some time.</p><p><b>Lisk</b><br>
While many people don&#8217;t know much about Lisk, the platform which offers JavaScript (a programming language) based smart contracts has been growing last year. It has seen its value increase, as well as its number of followers.<br>
While other smart contract platforms use programming languages like Solidity, the main selling point of Lisk is that it uses the much easier to learn JavaScript.<br>
Lisk uses a system called delegated proof of stake in order to generate more units. This means that in order to be a staker, you must first be elected as such by the community. While this may prevent some nefarious actors from entering the ecosystem, it could potentially limit the number of network participants as the average person is not encouraged to join due to the lack of steak rewards for non-delegates.<br>
Lisk tokens have reached valuations of near USD 30 each in recent days. A few months ago, tokens were trading at around USD 3-5 each.</p><p><b>Cardano</b><br>
Often called the &#8220;Ethereum of Japan&#8221;, this new platform aims to be what its creator Charles Hoskinson of IOHK calls a &#8220;third generation cryptocurrency&#8221;. In recent weeks, the price of Cardano units has seen ups and downs and stood at c. USD 0.83 in mid-January.<br>
According to the official project website, Cardano is a &#8220;technological platform that will be capable of running financial applications currently used every day by individuals, organisations and governments all around the world. The platform is being constructed in layers, which gives the system the flexibility to be more easily maintained and allow for upgrades by way of soft forks.&#8221;<br>
Cardano also offers what they call &#8220;regulated computing&#8221; &#8211; legal entities such as governments can affect the chain in accordance with a set of rules governing the platform.</p><p><b>Ethereum Classic</b><br>
Ethereum Classic actually predates Ethereum, as Ethereum Classic is the original chain of Ethereum. It is, however, slowly becoming a powerful alternative to the main Ethereum blockchain.<br>
Following a conference in Hong Kong last year where investors and developers met and discussed the future of Ethereum Classic, prices for Ethereum Classic units tripled and even quadrupled. Additionally, the Ethereum Classic blockchain instituted a new monetary policy to ensure that it is a deflationary asset by causing a reduction in the block reward to occur every so often.<br>
Ethereum Classic is fully compatible with the smart contract programming of Ethereum.<br>
While Ethereum is planning to move to proof of stake, or another type of algorithm by which a blockchain network aims to achieve consensus, Ethereum Classic is not, and it will stay on proof of work for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the possibility exists that once Ethereum changes its consensus algorithm, Ethereum miners could transition to mining Ethereum Classic.</p><p><b>RSK</b><br>
Launched by creator Diego Guti&eacute;rrez Zald&iacute;var, RSK plans to become bitcoin&#8217;s answer to Ethereum by adding a layer of smart contracts on top of the bitcoin blockchain. Not only will it allow smart contracts and distributed applications to run with bitcoin, it will also use a one to one exchange currency called Smart bitcoin or SBTC.<br>
Smart bitcoins can only exist when an equivalent amount of regular bitcoin is locked in an RSK contract. Smart bitcoins can then be transacted independently or through a contract at a drastically lower fee. <br>
RSK can be dual mined at the same time as bitcoin. Therefore, RSK will not need its own dedicated set of miners to process the network. If a miner chooses, they can add RSK mining to their operation and receive network transaction fees in exchange for participating.</p><p><b>NEM</b><br>
With a laser focused target on business and enterprise use-cases, NEM is positioning itself to be the blockchain platform of choice for big business. With their unique Smart Asset protocol, NEM claims that they can offer &ldquo;a fundamentally streamlined method of maintaining a secure ledger of transactions compared to a traditional database&rdquo;, according to their official website. <br>
In addition to its competitive feature set, NEM allows for the creation of new tokens within its ecosystem, much like Ethereum has its own ERC-20 tokens that have become popular for ICOs last year. <br>
The NEM native asset, XEM, has seen strong growth in the last 12 months, and has moved from less than one cent each to USD 1.47 each at press time. <br>
____________________</p><p><b>Are any of these &#8220;Ethereum killers&#8221;?</b><br>
At a recent conference held in Taipei, Vitalik Buterin said that Ethereum is the Ethereum of China, Ethereum is the Ethereum of Japan, and Ethereum is the Ethereum killer. While we don&#8217;t know if this will always be true, it&#8217;s safe to say that at least for the time being, Ethereum is here to stay.<br>
