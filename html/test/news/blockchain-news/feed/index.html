<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://bithomp.com/nft-statistics">data from Bithomp</a>, a total of 3,357,404 NFTs have been created using <a href="https://dev.to/ripplexdev/xrp-ledger-nfts-are-here-9jb">the XLS-20 standard</a>. This brings the overall count of NFTs to 2,994,775, owned by 30,972 different individuals.</p>
<p>The total number of NFT issuers has grown to 5,831, while 347,429 of these digital assets have been burned.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been 1,403,970 transfers of NFTs, and there are currently 92,860 NFTs that can be sold for XRP.
</p>
<h2>XRP Ledger NFT Growth</h2>
<p>
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) created by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lawyers-project-ripple-emerge-as-winners-over-sec-future-appeals.htm">Ripple</a> has been operational for over a decade, offering a range of features. Among these features are swift and cost-efficient transactions, outperforming many other currency-centric networks.</p>
<p>Additionally, XRPL provides native capabilities such as issued currencies, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/market-distortion-caused-by-regulation-disparity-in-token-prices-in-centralized-vs-decentralized-exchange.htm">decentralized exchange</a> (DEX), escrow functionalities, and token management.</p>
<p>Even though XRPL lacks support for smart contracts, it competently carries out various functions similar to other networks. These include handling NFTs, stablecoins, synthetic assets, and other programmable settlement layer assets.</p>
<p>A significant milestone for the XRP Ledger occurred in October 2022 with the introduction of the XLS-20 standard. This standard facilitated the creation of native <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/non-fungible-tokens-explained.htm">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) on the XRP Ledger, allowing for the representation, transfer, and ownership of unique assets.</p>
<p>It also introduced features like royalties and robust anti-spam measures, propelling XRPL&#8217;s growth and achievements.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-xrp-ledger-q3-2023?utm_source=twitter_messari&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=state_of_xrp_ledger_q3_2023">October 27 report from Messari</a>, an on-chain analytics company, XRPL&#8217;s average daily NFT transactions increased by 7.3% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 16,700.</p>
<p>Notably, the NFTokenBurn transaction type witnessed a substantial 135.7% quarter-over-quarter growth, with 1,700 daily transactions. NFTokenMints also experienced consecutive quarterly growth, rising by 13.1% in Q3 to 6,300 daily transactions.</p>
<p>However, other NFT transaction types, including NFTokenCreateOffer, NFTokenAcceptOffer, and NFTokenCancelOffer, declined by 7.0%, 7.4%, and 2.0% quarter-over-quarter, respectively.</p>
<p>NFTokenMint emerged as a dominant force, driven by a significant surge in mints, thanks to collaborative efforts from projects like XNS (an identity solution) and <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPFamilyNFT">XRP Family NFT</a> (a profile picture project).</p>
<p>By the end of Q3, a remarkable milestone was reached, with a total of 3 million NFTs minted using the XLS-20 standard. Notably, the &#8220;<a href="https://xpunks.club/">XPUNKS</a>&#8221; NFT collection led in sales volume, achieving a remarkable 4.4 million XRP in sales.</p>
<p>This achievement firmly establishes the XRP Ledger as a key player in the NFT landscape. As the NFT ecosystem continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to observe how other blockchain companies respond to Ripple&#8217;s success and whether they adopt similar eco-friendly and scalable approaches to attract a broader user base.</p>

<p>The digital asset market has recorded several wins this month with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a 16-month high and surging activities around decentralized finance (DeFI) applications.</p>
<p>According to data from DefiLlama, the <a href="https://defillama.com/?volume=true&amp;minTvl=100000000&amp;maxTvl=">total value locked</a> (TVL) on DeFi protocols has soared to $42 billion, marking a three-month high, gaining $6.2 billion from its $35.8 billion standpoint two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The whooping $6.2 billion growth in roughly 14 days comes on the heels of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-is-up-over-120-from-2022s-lows-here-is-how-high-it-could-pump-this-bull-market.htm">renewed market activity</a> as new liquidity gets pumped into the market. This can be seen in increasing activities of most protocols as altcoins continue to climb.</p>
<p>Several analysts have pinned the growth in the market on the rise in the price of BTC although the major factors changing the tide for DeFi protocols are rising prices of related tokens and inflows from investors looking to earn rewards.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

</p>
<h2>Defi transactions surges</h2>
<p>
Data from DefiLlama show that DeFi transactions tapped a seven-month high with $4.4 billion recorded on Oct 24 as staking protocols continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) biggest lending protocol, Marinade notched a 120% growth in TVL following a rollout of its native token which was spiked in recent days by renewed market activities.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has found new momentum by a recent rally that propelled Bitcoin’s value towards the $35,000 mark.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a> №cryptocurrency<a href="https://t.co/VB8NxT8cMP">https://t.co/VB8NxT8cMP</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Jito, Marinade&rsquo;s competitor, saw the TVL on its platform soar by 190% to $168 million while similar products across other chains also recorded growth.</p>
<p>This year, Solana has been described as an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-dominates-altcoin-inflows-as-crypto-funds-experience-fourth-week-of-gains.htm">institutional investor </a>favorite following its multiple weeks of inflows rising to new highs around trading activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) has struggled this year as institutional investors lack confidence in its products leading to massive outflows.</p>
<p>However, the last two weeks have seen the largest altcoin surge in market prices and trading volumes. At press time, ETH trades at $1,782 an increase from $1,590 at the same time frame.</p>
<p>Enzyme Finance, Spark, and Stafer also recorded mass inflows and growth ranging between 35% and 55%, below their Solana counterparts but a massive increase from previous weeks.
</p>
<h2>The wider market goes green</h2>
<p>
Avalanche and Lido saw massive inflows of 34% and 25% respectively alongside Sui which posted a TVL growth of 40 million taking it over the $70 million mark.</p>
<p>Similar growth was recorded in the Aptos network as layer 1 networks also benefited from the market&rsquo;s new wave.</p>
<p>Bitcoin currently <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">trades at $34,511</a> recording a 27.77% growth in the last 30 days on the backs of a potential spot BTC ETF approval.</p>
<p>While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected every previous spot BTC ETF application, certain experts and wealth management firms believe that approval is imminent and could come next year.</p>

<p>Binance, the crypto exchange that for long has dominated global crypto trading, has seen its market share continue to decline even as the overall market has surged higher.</p>
<p>The continued decline in market share for the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange was pointed to in a recent opinion <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/259575/binances-marketshare-continues-to-decline-amid-rally">piece</a> by The Block&rsquo;s Frank Chaparro, where he said that Binance&rsquo;s market share among exchanges without USD support has fallen from 74% in December last year to 50% as of this month.</p>
<p>The decline in market share has happened as Binance has continued to lose key employees, with at least 16 executives leaving the firm over the past couple of years, a fact that was also pointed to in Chaparro&rsquo;s piece.</p>
<p>Perhaps most notable among them was the departure of then-CEO of Binance.US, the former regulator Brian Brooks, who abruptly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/poloniex-settles-with-the-sec-new-digital-yuan-giveaway-more-11362.htm">left the company in August 2021</a> after serving only three months as CEO.</p>
<p>Brooks later revealed that the real reason he left Binance.US was because he was &ldquo;not actually the one running this company,&rdquo; noting that Binance&rsquo;s global CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was the one who was really charge.</p>
<p>Following Brooks&rsquo; departure, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cbdc-race-blockdaemon-unicorn-harmony-algorand-pour-millions-more-news.htm">Brian Shroder took over as CEO</a> of the exchange, before he also quit in mid-September this year in the midst of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm">regulatory storm around Binance.US</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to these CEOs, executives including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/beleaguered-binance-loses-another-chief-executive-from-its-uk-office-whats-going-on.htm">Binance UK Head Jonathan Farnell</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-us-loses-key-executives-as-regulatory-issues-intensify-heres-latest.htm">chief risk officer Sidney Majalya</a>, and Citadel veteran Seth Levy have all left the company within a short period of time.
</p>
<h2>Executive departures causing nervousness</h2>
<p>
Not surprisingly, the departures have caused some degree of nervousness among Binance users who still have last year&rsquo;s collapse of FTX fresh in mind.</p>
<p>In his piece, Chaparro quoted a professional crypto options trader as saying that the regulatory actions taken against Binance has scared trading firms from committing too much capital to the exchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is tough for institutional guys to commit resources given the headline risk. [High frequency trading] guys have outsized volume due to the nature of the trading style,&rdquo; the trader was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Binance had a &ldquo;normalized&rdquo; 24-hour spot trading volume of $4.6 billion.</p>
<p>This compares to the $1.3 billion in normalized spot volume that rival exchange OKX boasts, CoinGecko data shows.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-testifies-ftx-had-no-risk-management-team-denies-defrauding-anyone-a-lot-of-people-got-hurt.htm">continued his testimony</a> while fielding grilling questions from the prosecution in Manhattan federal court on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The defense finished their direct examination of Bankman-Fried earlier this morning, prompting Bankman-Fried to begin his cross-examination conducted by US Assistant Attorney Danielle Sassoon.
</p>
<h2><b>Prosecution grills Bankman-Fried</b></h2>
<p>
Sassoon began Bankman-Fried&#8217;s cross-examination by pushing the often circuitous Bankman-Fried to answer the questions presented directly, which included a number of statements Bankman-Fried made to the public and media.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX">number of tweets</a>, Bankman-Fried wrote that FTX was the &#8220;most regulated crypto exchange by far&#8221; and that &#8220;funds and safety come first&#8221; on the platform. Similarly, in November 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that Alameda played by the same rules as everyone else on the exchange.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that customers would always be allowed to withdraw whatever funds they had on FTX. However, nearly two weeks later, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto empire would collapse.</p>
<p>Moreover, Sassoon grilled Bankman-Fried on the relationship between FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, causing the soft-spoken Bankman-Fried to hesitate. In several instances, Judge Kaplan asked Bankman-Fried to answer the question he was asked after the defendant failed to do so adequately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you say you were not at all involved in Alameda&#8217;s trading in 2022,&#8221; Sassoon questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on how you define trading,&#8221; the FTX founder responded.
</p>
<h2><b>Damning Twitter messages</b></h2>
<p>
In another pointed moment during his time on the witness stand, Bankman-Fried was asked to read Twitter messages he sent to journalist Kelsey Piper in November 2022, which included admitting that much of what he said in regards to regulation was &#8220;just PR.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was quickly followed by another message written by the disgraced &#8220;king of crypto&#8221; that read &#8220;f-ck regulators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sassoon then pointed out that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bankman-fried-continues-testimony-i-didnt-want-to-be-known-as-the-kansas-city-royals-of-crypto-exchanges.htm">Bankman-Fried</a> would leverage Twitter as a means of communicating with users and potential customers who were a part of Crypto Twitter. Bankman-Fried then acknowledged he called a subset of these users &#8220;dumb motherf-ckers&#8221; in a private conversation.
</p>
<h2><b>SBF&#8217;s congressional testimony comes back to bite him</b></h2>
<p>
Sassoon then probed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sbf-testifies-in-hearing-claims-alameda-research-had-right-to-borrow-funds.htm">Bankman-Fried on his testimony</a> before Congress, where the FTX founder claimed that users had &#8220;refunded collateral deposits instead of credit extensions&#8221; on the exchange.</p>
<p>The prosecution then noted that Alameda&#8217;s account on the exchange was allowed a $65 billion line of credit. Moreover, Alameda&#8217;s &#8220;special privileges&#8221; were never disclosed to customers or the public.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried claimed in an interview with Bloomberg that FTX and Alameda were &#8220;wholly separate entities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried will continue his cross-examination this afternoon.</p>

<p>Thailand&rsquo;s second-largest bank, signaling bullish fervor for blockchain after buying out one of the region&rsquo;s local crypto exchanges through one of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In a Monday <a href="https://www.kasikornbank.com/en/IR/FinanInfoReports/LetterToSET/20231030_UnitaCapital_EN.pdf">filing</a>, Kasikornbank &ndash; otherwise known as KBank &ndash; revealed that it has acquired a 97% stake in Satang Corporation Co Ltd., which runs a digital asset trading platform, Satang Pro.</p>
<p>Per its website, Kasikornbank boasts assets worth $120 billion in total. Its exchange acquisition was valued at 3.7 billion Baht, worth $103 million USD.</p>
<p>Satang is now pending a rebranding to Orbix Trade Company Limited, reminiscent of the bank subsidiary&rsquo;s other crypto companies. In March 2022, KBank established &ldquo;Unita Capital&rdquo; to invest in digital asset firms, which now include Orbix Custodian and Orbix Invest &ndash; a crypto fund manager &ndash; among others.</p>
<p>Another of the company&rsquo;s subsidiaries is Orbix Technology and Innovation, a blockchain infrastructure and development business established for 260 million Baht ($7.2 million USD) in July, according to the filing.</p>
<p>KBank announced a new fund, KXVC, in September to invest in Web3 and AI startups, as established by the bank&rsquo;s technology arm Kasikorn Business Technology Group. KBank said it would maintain a specific focus on Asia Pacific.
</p>
<h2>Crypto Regulation in Thailand</h2>
<p>
Satang Pro stands out as one of the few crypto exchanges in Thailand regulated by the region&rsquo;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That said, it faced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/thai-sec-comes-after-bitkub-exchange-opensea-rewards-whitehats-bis-working-with-at-least-7-central-banks-on-cbdc-projects-more-news.htm">civil sanctions</a> from the SEC among a handful of other exchanges last year for fabricating trading volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/thailand-delays-plan-distribute-15-billion-digital-currency-its-citizens.htm">Thailand</a>&rsquo;s regulatory stance on crypto is mixed: in March 2022, the nation&rsquo;s Ministry of Tourism banned crypto&rsquo;s use for payments, mimicking countries like Russia and China.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the government scrapped a 7% VAT on crypto exchange trading last year, and the Ministry of Finance advocated for tax breaks and other incentives for ICO promoters in March.</p>
<p>In August, Thailand also elected the pro-crypto politician Srettha Thavisin as Prime Minister in August. During his time as CEO of real estate giant Sansiri, his firm took part in a $225 million fundraiser for XSpring Capital, a crypto asset manager.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thailand&rsquo;s institutional interest in crypto is growing. Beyond KBank, its competitor &ndash; Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) &ndash; intended to acquire Thailand&rsquo;s largest exchange, BitKub, for $500 million in 2022 before unresolved regulatory issues caused them to scrap the deal.</p>

<p>The adoption of the popular stablecoin Tether (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">USDT</a>) in Brazil has experienced a remarkable surge in 2023, now constituting a staggering 80% of all crypto transactions within the country.</p>
<p>According to data provided by Brazil&#8217;s tax agency that was first <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazil-usdt-adoption-soars-2023-80-crypto-transactions">reported</a> on by Cointelegraph, the total USDT transactions in Brazil for the year amounted to approximately $271 billion Brazilian reais (equivalent to roughly $55 billion USD) as of mid-October,</p>
<p>The amount is nearly double the volume of Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) transactions in the country, totaling $151 billion reais (about $30 billion USD).
</p>
<h2>USDT first surpassed Bitcoin in 2022</h2>
<p>
USDT has seen a consistent increase in popularity in Brazil since 2021.</p>
<p>Notably, they surpassed the volume of Bitcoin transactions for the first time in July 2022, marking a significant shift in the country&#8217;s crypto landscape.</p>
<p>With the crypto downturn in 2022, however, Brazil saw a reduction of close to 25% in crypto transactions, and by the end of the year the reported volume stood at only $154.4 billion reais (around $31 billion USD), Cointelegraph reported, citing government data.
</p>
<h2>Crypto held abroad now taxable</h2>
<p>
In addition to keeping track of domestic crypto transactions, Brazil&rsquo;s tax agency is now also watching crypto investments held abroad by Brazilian citizens after the country&rsquo;s parliament passed legislation recognizing crypto as &#8220;financial assets&#8221; for tax purposes, the report said.</p>
<p>Beginning in January 2024, earnings from overseas investments between 6,000 and 50,000 reais (roughly $10,000 to $100,000 USD) will be subject to a 15% tax rate.</p>
<p>For amounts exceeding this threshold, taxes will be imposed at a rate of 22.5%.</p>
<p>In Brazil, profits from crypto sales exceeding 35,000 reais (around $7,000 USD) per month are taxed at a rate ranging from 15% to 22.5%.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom has released proposals for a stablecoin framework alongside wider industry regulations in a bid to position the country as an investment destination and to protect users.</p>
<p>In an Oct 30 release, His Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653a82b7e6c968000daa9bdd/Update_on_Plans_for_Regulation_of_Fiat-backed_Stablecoins_13.10.23_FINAL.pdf">published a set of guidelines</a> for regulating &lsquo;fiat-backed stablecoins&rsquo; amid calls for global regulation following wider scrutiny in the markets.</p>
<p>In recent times, calls have been made for the UK to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-residents-flags-privacy-concerns-in-digital-pound-consultations-bank-of-england.htm">release an official statement</a> on stablecoin usage and incorporate these assets into the financial system to encourage cross-border payments.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png" alt="🇬🇧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> UK Residents Flags Privacy Concerns in Digital Pound Consultations: Bank of England</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/bankofengland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bankofengland</a> says the majority of feedback from the public consultation on the digital pound revolved around privacy and fiat scarcity concerns.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a><a href="https://t.co/15tcNj02KA">https://t.co/15tcNj02KA</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1717924080110694794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Per the release, the new laws will bring fiat-backed stablecoins under the purview of the Bank of England (BoE), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) to create financial stability and risk of regulatory overlaps.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>The government expects that this phased approach will provide a degree of optionality and flexibility for firms wishing to undertake phase 1 activities as early adopters as well as those with business models more focused on phase 2-only activities</i>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Fiat-backed stablecoins in the financial system&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
According to the release, stablecoins will be regulated in ways; from the assets used in chains and by regulating the activity relating to issuance and custody of the assets.</p>
<p>The use of stablecoin in payment chains will be brought under the Payment Service Regulation (2017) which has a template for related institutions providing financial services.</p>
<p>On issuance, the FCA will take <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-crypto-lobby-group-voices-concerns-about-fcas-incentives-ban-impact-whats-going-on.htm">charge of rules guiding firms</a> as the activities around releasing new assets will be included in the Financial Services and Markets Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This will enable the FCA to make rules for firms conducting these activities. Firms wishing to apply for authorization to conduct either of those issuance or custody activities will be subject to FCA rules and guidance as is usual for FCA-regulated activities.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UK Treasury seeks to make foreign companies&#8217; operations in line with local standards as non-fiat-backed stablecoins are prohibited from regulated payment chains, although no direct ban was made.</p>
<p>Stablecoin issuers will also be required by the FCA to hold reserve funds of assets as set out by the Commission&rsquo;s rules with a provision for an application of the Insolvency Act 1986 in case of a subsequent failure.
</p>
<h2>Wider regulations on the horizon&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
This year, several policy watchers have lauded the UK&rsquo;s efforts at crypto regulations in line with the vision of Rishi Sunak to make the country a crypto hub in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UK&rsquo;s Treasury Minister Andrew Griffith described the latest move as a step in the right direction following months of anticipation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, the UK released responses to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-england-and-treasury-explore-possibility-of-launching-a-state-backed-digital-pound.htm">consultation paper and addressed issues</a> surrounding a digital pound and investor demand for wider stablecoin regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the paper, proper regulation will be set out with fiat-backed stablecoins as phase 1 and algorithmic and other assets coming up in the second phase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around 25 individuals have reportedly lost $4.4 million in cryptocurrency from a total of 80 wallets, all due to the 2022 data breach that affected the password storage software LastPass.</p>
<p>On October 27, in a Twitter post, the on-chain sleuths ZachXBT, along with MetaMask developer <a href="https://www.chainabuse.com/report/53eddb18-d11c-43ea-94b5-2f373d55f28f">Taylor Monahan</a>, reported that they&#8217;ve tracked the movement of funds from at least 80 compromised wallets that were targeted on October 25. They also mentioned that many of the victims were long-time LastPass users who had stored their cryptocurrency wallet keys or seeds on the platform.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s all of the related addresses myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tayvano_</a> collected from Oct 25. <a href="https://t.co/hsXaUi8Fhg">https://t.co/hsXaUi8Fhg</a></p>
<p>If you suspect you were already a victim of the LastPass hack send a DM with the txn hashes of the theft.</p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1717903968037179768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This security breach has been affecting LastPass since last year and continues to impact its users. In September, it was discovered that at least $35 million in cryptocurrency had been stolen from approximately 150 victims affected by the platform&#8217;s security breach that occurred in 2022.</p>
<p>LastPass, in its usual function, is a popular password manager designed to secure users&#8217; login credentials. The attack on it involved unauthorized access to user accounts, with a focus on obtaining seed phrases and wallet keys used for cryptocurrency storage, indicating that they were primarily interested in exfiltrating cryptocurrencies.
</p>
<h2>LastPass Discloses 2022 Data Breach Exposing Customer Data and Source Code Theft</h2>
<p>
However, in a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/">blog post</a> in December 2022, LastPass disclosed that an attacker had used previously stolen information to target an employee, gaining access to their credentials and decrypting customer data. The attack on LastPass allowed the hacker to gain access to the corporate laptop of a software engineer on the platform, which provided them with the means to infiltrate the company&#8217;s system. In the process, they stole source code, confidential technical documentation, and internal system secrets.</p>
<p>Additionally, a backup of encrypted customer vault <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/data-breach-why-it-big-threat-for-crypto-traders-how-prevent-it.htm">data</a> was stolen, which could be decrypted if the attacker successfully guessed the account&#8217;s master password through brute force.</p>
<p>This initial breach enabled the hacker to extract 14 of LastPass&#8217;s 200 source code repositories. Subsequently, the hacker conducted a more extensive attack, leading to the acquisition of a copy of the LastPass customer database.</p>
<p>This database contained information such as unencrypted account details and associated metadata, including multi-factor authentication settings.
</p>
<h2>LastPass Faces Lawsuit After $32 Million Crypto Theft</h2>
<p>
LastPass&#8217;s CEO initially claimed that the hack had been contained and that the compromised data did not include personal user information. It was later reported in August 2023 that over 1200 BTC, valued at $32 million, had been stolen from wallets associated with LastPass users in the year following the security breach.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, several users reported losing significant amounts of cryptocurrency from wallets whose keys were stored on LastPass.</p>
<p>This incident resulted in the US District Court of Massachusetts filing a <a href="https://assets.law360news.com/1562000/1562534/https-ecf-mad-uscourts-gov-doc1-095111497456.pdf">lawsuit</a> against the company in January, alleging that it failed to protect user data adequately.</p>
<p>Also, in January, LastPass faced a class-action lawsuit from individuals who claimed that the August 2022 breach led to the theft of around $53,000 worth of Bitcoin, which was valued at $34,317 at the time.</p>
<p>In his recent post, ZachXBT advised anyone who had ever stored a wallet seed or private key in LastPass to transfer their cryptocurrency assets immediately.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">And over the past years, it emerged as a major crypto/blockchain/Web3 hub.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Singapore has also been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-tops-list-of-crypto-friendly-investment-migration-destinations.htm">named</a> the preferred destination for crypto millionaires seeking secure and tax-friendly havens to protect their digital assets.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left">How are this startup and Keiser&rsquo;s connection to the President relevant?</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In September 2021, El Salvador famously made <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-adoption-in-focus-as-el-salvador-enters-new-era.htm">Bitcoin legal tender</a>, and it launched a custodial wallet called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvadors-chivo-btc-app-largely-disused-atm-booths-empty-report.htm">Chivo Wallet</a> &ndash; both of which have since been heavily criticized.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Nonetheless, El Salvador pushed on with its Bitcoin plans, including creating a <a href="El%20Salvador%20Town%20Tires%20of%20Waiting%20for%20Bukele,%20Will%20Build%20%E2%80%98Real%20Bitcoin%20City%E2%80%99">Bitcoin City</a> and using volcanic resources to power the above-mentioned Volcano Energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Earlier this month, El Salvador announced the launch of <strong>Lava Pool</strong>, the country&rsquo;s first Bitcoin mining pool powered entirely by renewable geothermal energy. It was a combined effort of Volcano Energy and tech giant <strong>Luxor Technology</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Meanwhile, Bukele formally <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvadors-pro-bitcoin-president-registers-for-re-election-in-2024.htm">filed</a> for re-election in next year&rsquo;s polls, a move critics say is against the country&rsquo;s constitution.</p>
<p>
Notably, as all of that was happening, El Salvador&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/bitcoin-touting-bukele-s-bond-rally-draws-jpmorgan-eaton-vance?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall#xj4y7vzkg">sovereign bonds</a> yielded a 70% return by August.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Also, in September, the <strong>Ministry of Education</strong> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvadors-education-ministry-introduces-bitcoin-learning-schools.htm">started</a> a pilot program to teach 150 public school teachers about Bitcoin. These teachers then returned to their schools across the country to transfer the knowledge to their students.</p>

<p>Thailand&#8217;s second-largest bank, Kasikorn Bank, widely known as K-Bank, has acquired a 97% stake in the parent company of the established Satang crypto exchange.</p>
<p>This strategic acquisition comes as K-Bank intensifies its efforts in the cryptocurrency sector, aiming to offer a comprehensive range of crypto services that comply with Thailand&#8217;s regulatory framework.
</p>
<h2>K-Bank Acquires Majority Stake for $102 Million</h2>
<p>
The deal, valued at 3.705 billion Thai baht (approximately $102.8 million), was executed through a newly established K-Bank subsidiary known as Unita Capital, <a href="https://thailand.postsen.com/business/203229/Entering-the-digital-asset-business-%E2%80%98Kasikorn-Bank%E2%80%99-acquires-Satang-Pro-a-crypto-trading-board.html">Thailand Posts reported</a>.</p>
<p>Unita Capital holds a specific mandate to invest in digital assets companies, aligning with K-Bank&#8217;s commitment to expanding its presence in the digital asset and cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Once the transaction concludes, Satang will undergo a rebranding process, emerging as Orbix.</p>
<p>This transformation signifies a broader shift in K-Bank&#8217;s digital strategy, as Orbix will encompass three additional subsidiaries: Orbix Custodian, Orbix Invest (a digital asset fund manager), and Orbix Technology, a blockchain technology developer.
</p>
<h2>Thai Bank Launched $100 Million Fund Dedicated to Web3 Investments</h2>
<p>
Bank&#8217;s venture into the crypto sector comes on the heels of the bank&#8217;s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kasikornbank-launches-100m-fund-boost-065532076.html#:~:text=Investing.com-,Kasikornbank%20launches%20%24100m%20fund%20to%20boost%20AI,startups%2C%20eyeing%20Asia%20Pacific%20expansion&amp;text=In%20a%20move%20to%20foster,fund%20named%20KXVC%20on%20Wednesday.">recent launch of a $100 million fund</a> dedicated to investments in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">web3</a>, fintech, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Notably, K-Bank&#8217;s rival, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), has also been actively pursuing opportunities in the web3 and cryptocurrency domains, indicating the growing importance of these areas in the Thai financial landscape.</p>
<p>Udomsak Rakwongwan, a professor at Kasetsart University and co-founder of FWX.finance, a company in which K-Bank has invested, expressed that K-Bank has obtained a crypto exchange license and is actively pursuing additional licenses for crypto-related activities in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/thailand/">Thailand</a>.</p>
