According to Immunefi, Mixin Network and Multichain were among the hardest hit, with a combined loss of $326 million due to hacks.&nbsp;</p><p>This mammoth loss accounted for 47.5% of all losses recorded in Q3. Other protocols, such as CoinEx, CoinsPaid, Curve Finance, and JPEG&rsquo;d, also fell victim to illegal fund draining by malicious actors.</p><p>Moreso, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum.htm">Ethereum blockchain-based projects</a> were the prime targets of these bad actors as a record number of 35 Web3 protocols were hit on the older blockchain protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Binance-owned BNB Chain came a close second on the list, with 25 protocols seeing their funds drained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A surprise appearance was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/base-blockchain-attracts-68-million-ether-ahead-of-official-launch.htm">Coinbase-owned Base</a>, which suffered four incidents, representing 4.9% of total losses across chains.&nbsp;</p><p>Optimism followed with three incidents, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-proposes-upgrade-native-token-from-matic-pol.htm">Polygon </a>and a few others suffered two incidents, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> completed the list with only 1 incident on its records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Zooming in on the principal characters behind this series of cyberattacks, the North Korean-sponsored&nbsp; Lazarus Group came up tops.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="828" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/125898/332440/screenshot-assets-ctfasse.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/125898/332440/responsive-images/screenshot-assets-ctfasse___media_library_original_828_272.jpg 828w, https://cimg.co/news/125898/332440/responsive-images/screenshot-assets-ctfasse___media_library_original_720_237.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/125898/332440/responsive-images/screenshot-assets-ctfasse___media_library_original_600_197.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/125898/332440/responsive-images/screenshot-assets-ctfasse___media_library_original_300_99.jpg 300w"><figcaption>Source: Immunefi</figcaption></figure><p>Immunefi stated that the infamous hacking team carted away over $208 million, indicating a 30% value from the total losses suffered in Q3.&nbsp;</p><p>Lazarus Group executed its heist on CoinEx, Stake, Alphapo, and CoinsPaid.&nbsp;</p><h2>DeFi Still a Juicy Honeypot for Hackers</h2><p>The crypto market is broken into several sub-sectors. One of the most prominent is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/introduction-decentralized-finance-defi.htm">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) sub-sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Like its name sounds, trades here are not centrally controlled, with users having direct control and access to their accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no intermediary, and anyone can buy and sell digital assets. This lack of central oversight has made the DeFi space a prime target for several malicious actors.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/crypto-hacks-exploits-by-method"><u>CoinGecko</u></a>, the DeFi landscape lost an astronomical $2.8 billion in stolen funds in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The hacks were executed using various methods, including verification process bypass, market manipulation, crowd looting, as well as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contract</a> and bridge exploits.&nbsp;</p><p>The report pointed out Sky Mavis&rsquo; Ronin Network hack of $625 million as the principal network that lost the most in crypto losses. This security breach was done via the access hack method.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Disclaimer: The following article is part of Cryptonews Deals Series and was written as a promotional article in collaboration with the sponsor of this offer. If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/news/115483/278316/picture1.jpg" srcset="" width="" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p style="text-align:justify;"><i>It&rsquo;s no secret that cryptocurrencies have gained immense popularity as &zwnj;modern, decentralized financial assets. And with their increasing value, safeguarding them has become paramount. As the cryptocurrency market continues expanding significantly, various versatile crypto wallets have emerged to accommodate the diverse range of available digital currencies. Thus, one crucial aspect of securing cryptocurrencies is choosing the right crypto wallet.</i></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i>This article will guide you through the key considerations for selecting a secure crypto wallet and introduce Defexa Crypto Wallet, a reliable and trusted option for protecting your digital assets.</i></p><h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Significance of Selecting the Right Crypto Wallet</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Choosing the right crypto wallet is critical to protecting your cryptocurrencies. With various wallet options available, it&#8217;s essential to consider factors such as <i><strong>security, user-friendliness, compatibility</strong></i>, and <i><strong>functionality</strong></i>. A wrong choice could result in potential risks such as theft, hacking, or losing access to your digital assets, leading to severe consequences.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The choice of a cryptocurrency wallet is not to be taken lightly, as it directly impacts the security, accessibility, and control of one&#8217;s cryptocurrency holdings. Let&#8217;s explore the reasons why selecting the right cryptocurrency wallet is essential.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Security: </strong>The security of your cryptocurrency holdings should be your top priority when choosing a wallet. Since cryptocurrencies are digital assets, they are vulnerable to online threats like hacking, phishing, and malware attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Despite being a mobile crypto wallet, Defexa maintains the highest level of security. As an innovative and new-to-market solution, Defexa Wallet harbors advanced security measures such as secret phrase backup, PIN code, and biometric authentication.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Control:</strong> Cryptocurrency wallets come in different types, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and online wallets. Each type offers different levels of control over your private keys. It&#8217;s essential to carefully consider the type of wallet that aligns with your desired level of control over your crypto assets. Not your keys, not your coins, remember?</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, <a href="https://defexa.io/wallet?utm_source=Media&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Cryptonews_art&amp;utm_id=Cryptonews&amp;utm_term=Cryptonews&amp;utm_content=Launch">Defexa Wallet</a> does not retain or store users&#8217; private keys.

It enhances the wallet&#8217;s security and minimizes the risk of potential hacks or unauthorized access to users&#8217; private keys and funds.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Accessibility: </strong>Different wallets offer varying degrees of accessibility in terms of platform support, ease of use, and availability of features. Choosing a wallet compatible with the cryptocurrencies you own is essential and provides a user-friendly interface that meets your needs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://defexa.io/wallet?utm_source=Media&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Cryptonews_art&amp;utm_id=Cryptonews&amp;utm_term=Cryptonews&amp;utm_content=Launch">Defexa Wallet</a> supports 100+ tokens, providing a comprehensive and all-purpose solution to store, manage, and trade every popular digital currency within a single app interface.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Defexa Wallet keeps up-to-date with the latest developments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, ensuring users can access the most current and relevant tokens.

Research the wallet provider&#8217;s reputation, history, and customer reviews thoroughly. Look for wallets that have been around for a while and have a solid reputation for security and reliability.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://defexa.io/wallet?utm_source=Media&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Cryptonews_art&amp;utm_id=Cryptonews&amp;utm_term=Cryptonews&amp;utm_content=Launch">Defexa</a> Digital Wallet is committed to becoming a trusted and compliant platform.

Join us as we navigate through the decentralized landscape of<a href="https://www.avatrade.com.au/forex/cryptocurrencies"> cryptocurrency trading</a>.</p><h2><strong>Understanding DeFi: Unlocking Financial Freedom</strong></h2><p>Let&#8217;s dive into the inner workings of this groundbreaking technology.</p><h3><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3><p>At the heart of DeFi are smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements coded on blockchain networks. These contracts automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. Smart contracts ensure transparency, immutability, and security in DeFi transactions.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="977" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/blockchain.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_977_550.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_900_507.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276088/responsive-images/blockchain___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong></h3><p>DeFi relies on blockchain technology, most commonly the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchain provides a decentralized and transparent ledger where all transactions and data are recorded. It acts as a single source of truth, ensuring that participants can verify and audit transactions in real-time.</p><h3><strong>Decentralized Applications (DApps)</strong></h3><p>DeFi protocols are built as decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchain networks. These DApps offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and investing, without relying on intermediaries like banks or brokers.</p><h3><strong>Interoperability</strong></h3><p>One of the key features of DeFi is its interoperability. DeFi protocols are designed to work seamlessly with each other, allowing users to leverage multiple applications and services within the ecosystem. This enables innovative financial products and services to be created by combining various DeFi protocols.</p><h3><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</strong></h3><p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) play a crucial role in DeFi by enabling peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading. DEXs operate without the need for a central authority, allowing users to retain control of their funds. They utilize smart contracts to facilitate trustless and secure transactions directly between participants.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="977" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/liquidity.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_977_550.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_900_507.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_720_405.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276090/responsive-images/liquidity___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Liquidity Pools and Automated Market Makers (AMMs)</strong></h3><p>DeFi platforms often utilize liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMMs) to enable efficient trading.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquidity providers deposit their cryptocurrencies into these pools, which are used to facilitate trades. AMMs, governed by smart contracts, automatically determine token prices based on the ratio of assets in the pool, ensuring liquidity and continuous trading.</p><h3><strong>Yield Farming and Staking</strong></h3><p>DeFi introduces innovative concepts like yield farming and staking, incentivizing users to participate in the ecosystem.</p><p>Yield farming involves users providing liquidity to protocols in exchange for rewards in the form of additional tokens. Staking, on the other hand, involves users locking their tokens to support network operations and earning staking rewards.</p><h3><strong>Governance and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):</strong></h3><p>Many DeFi protocols employ governance mechanisms through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).&nbsp;</p><p>DAOs enable token holders to participate in decision-making processes like protocol upgrades, fee structures, or asset listings. Token holders can vote on proposals, ensuring a democratic and decentralized governance structure.</p><h3><strong>Security and Auditing</strong></h3><p>While DeFi offers numerous opportunities, it is crucial to address security concerns. Understanding the risks, using reputable platforms, and employing best security practices are essential for safe participation in DeFi.</p><p>Smart contracts are audited to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate risks. However, users must remain vigilant and conduct due diligence before interacting with DeFi protocols.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of DeFi</strong></h2><p>Here are some of the benefits of decentralized finance:</p><h3><strong>Financial Inclusion</strong></h3><p>DeFi opens up financial services to anyone with an internet connection, enabling individuals from underserved regions to participate in global markets.</p><h3><strong>Transparency</strong></h3><p>DeFi protocols operate on open and auditable blockchains, providing users with unparalleled visibility into transactions and smart contract operations.</p><h3><strong>Elimination of Intermediaries</strong></h3><p>By removing intermediaries such as banks or brokers, DeFi reduces costs and enhances efficiency, ensuring a more equitable financial ecosystem.</p><h3><strong>Programmability</strong></h3><p>DeFi protocols are built on smart contracts, allowing for the creation of complex and automated financial applications that operate autonomously.</p><h2><strong>What are the risks of DeFi?</strong></h2><p>While DeFi offers exciting opportunities, it also comes with risks. Smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainties are some key risks associated with DeFi.&nbsp;</p><p>Diversifying investments, staying informed, and using reputable platforms to mitigate these risks are, thus, crucial. Some of the risks of DeFi include:</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>DeFi applications are built on top of relatively new and untested blockchain technology. There have been several high-profile hacks of DeFi applications, so choosing your DeFi applications carefully is important.</p><h3><strong>Complexity</strong></h3><p>DeFi applications can be complex and difficult to understand. It is important to do your research before using any DeFi application.</p><h3><strong>Volatility</strong></h3><p>The prices of cryptocurrencies, which are used to power DeFi applications, are volatile. This means that your investment could lose value quickly.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DeFi and Cryptocurrency Trading: Empowering Investors</strong></h2><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="977" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/decentralized.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_977_489.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_900_450.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_720_360.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_600_300.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/114223/276091/responsive-images/decentralized___media_library_original_300_150.jpg 300w"></figure><p>One of the key areas where DeFi has made significant strides is cryptocurrency trading. DEXs are platforms that facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. Users retain control of their funds while trading directly with other participants, making DEXs more secure and resistant to hacks.</p><h3><strong>Advantages of DEXs</strong></h3><p>Here are some of the pros of decentralized exchanges:</p><h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3><p>DEXs eliminate the need for users to trust centralized exchanges with their funds, reducing the risk of hacks or theft.</p><h3><strong>Greater Privacy</strong></h3><p>DEXs often operate without user identification or KYC procedures, allowing individuals to maintain their privacy.</p><h3><strong>Lower Fees</strong></h3><p>DEXs typically have lower transaction fees than centralized exchanges, as they remove the costs associated with intermediaries.</p><p><strong>Promote a highly regulated brokerage with an excellent reputation.</strong></p><p>Promote an established, highly forex regulated brokerage with a strong international presence and regulatory licenses across 6 jurisdictions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Disclaimer: The following article is part of Cryptonews Deals Series and was written as a promotional article in collaboration with the sponsor of this offer. If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The craze of decentralized finance is raging. Although the cryptocurrency world can be overwhelming for people who have just started their decentralized trading journey, the returns it offers urge them to take chances even with the new technology.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To make investing and trading these currencies user-friendly and easily understandable, several decentralized platforms are emerging, taking advantage of the rising crypto fever.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">These platforms provide an interface to crypto users and are an educational resource that makes the cryptocurrency world more accessible for beginners.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">One such easy-to-use network is NEST. This article will explain the NEST platform&#8217;s solutions to crypto users facing volatile market conditions with a safe and trusted mechanism.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Let&rsquo;s begin!</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the NEST Protocol?</strong></h2><p>The <a href="https://www.nestprotocol.org/">NEST protocol</a> is a decentralized trading infrastructure called the martingale network. It leverages smart contracts to eliminate the top crypto market makers, providing traders infinite liquidity to their funds through a risk-sharing concept.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/news/107800/262171/1500x500.jpg" srcset width class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p style="text-align:justify;">It is utilized for various purposes, including decentralized contract exchanges, financial supermarkets, on-chain and off-chain risk hedging, lottery platforms, GameFi, metaverse, and prop synthesis.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The platform has its token, NEST, issued on the Ethereum ERC20 protocol with a total value of 1500 integers. The total supply of NEST tokens is ten billion.</p><p>The NEST network has achieved a significant number of followers on major social media platforms, including TikTok (1.1 Million), Twitter (948.1 K), and Telegram (114 K).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Besides being popular on social media channels, NEST has also been launched on dozens of exchanges, including Coinbase, and has partnerships with 100+ project owners and institutions.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is Martingale Trading?</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">A Martingale trade is where the cost you pay to buy the asset at the current time is equal to the mathematical expectation of the asset at subsequent points in time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The martingale function automatically raises the cost of the majority of positions. It compensates for the minority of positions to ensure the overall fairness of the transaction, which reduces the net exposure of the system to a certain extent.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It ensures that the system is not exposed to more risk than it can bear by limiting its maximum position.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Challenges Of Current Decentralized Exchanges</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Here are the risks and problems involved with existing decentralized exchanges:</p><ul><li><strong>Restricted cross-channel transaction:</strong> One of the significant problems of decentralized platforms is the need for more provision for cross-chain transactions. It also proves to be one of the critical reasons for the slow adoption.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dormancy of order management: </strong>Existing decentralized exchanges have been doomed to a great extent due to the restricted generation of volumes due to inefficiencies in the design. This also tends to create a high cost for the market makers. They spend a steep cost on gas every time an order is posted, modified, or canceled.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Low liquidity and limited transaction volumes:</strong> The cryptocurrencies displayed on decentralized platforms have a low liquidity problem. It also generates problems in the liquidity pool system, causing liability and inflationary pressure on the whole system.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Does NEST Martingale Solve These Problems?</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Here is how NEST Martingale can help you solve problems of existing decentralized exchanges:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">NEST Martingale allows derivative trading by eliminating the need for market makers or liquidity pools.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">This network provides an unlimited supply of financial products using smart contracts, the largest seller in the entire system. You can quickly burn your NEST tokens to buy a wide range of financial products on the Martingale network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">NEST Martingale network solves the problem of coordinating with intermediaries by eliminating added costs and delays. All the data is collected and gathered anonymously, and companies don&rsquo;t need to contact a third party, which saves time and money.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">NEST Martingale network is one of the top cost-effective decentralized trading platforms that achieve 100% of the transaction fee as a rebate for referred trades. The NEST platform doesn&rsquo;t have any custody cost, no technical cost, no liquidity cost, and no interest cost.</li><li>The risk is managed significantly using the NEST martingale network as it automatically increases the cost of the majority of positions and redresses the minority. This ensures the transaction&#8217;s impartiality, reducing the overall system&#8217;s net exposure to a great extent.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p style="text-align:justify;">Compared to other decentralized platforms, NEST has a relatively high supply of tokens, making it an impressive and inviting network for beginners and established traders. Another intriguing factor of the network that makes it a must-choice is the reliable data it offers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">With its innovative and upgraded technology, NEST promises to increase the likelihood of mass blockchain adoption with an accurate and secure system for all traders and investors. Its future also holds the possibility of 1000+ trading users daily.</p>

If your company has an exclusive promotion that you would like to share with our readers, we invite you to reach out to us. Let&rsquo;s build together.</i></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/picture1111.jpg" srcset="https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/responsive-images/picture1111___media_library_original_624_351.jpg 624w, https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/responsive-images/picture1111___media_library_original_600_338.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/104291/255735/responsive-images/picture1111___media_library_original_300_169.jpg 300w" width="624" class="content-img" alt=""></figure><p><strong>London, UK</strong> &mdash; In January 2023, decentralized options and social trading platform OptionBlitz, launched its community networks. The platform is now poised for a February deployment into Ethereum Layer protocol Arbitrum, to offer unique trading options like &lsquo;zero-day&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Turbo&rsquo;. OptionBlitz will also run a 2-stage (BLX) token presale from February 28th to March 28th, 2023.</p><h2><strong>What is OptionBlitz?</strong></h2><p><a href="https://optionblitz.co/">OptionBlitz</a> is a decentralized, enterprise-grade options and social trading platform &#8211; powered by Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Protocol underpins all of the platform&#8217;s trading options including Zero-day, Barrier, American/European options, and the world&#8217;s first DeFi Perpetual option, known as &lsquo;Turbo&rsquo;.</p><h2><strong>Zero-day Options and More</strong></h2><p>The OptionBlitz platform offers a multitude of cutting-edge trading options, unique features, and over 22 different trading pairs. Zero-day options are one of the fastest-growing trends in the financial markets and one of the pillars of the OptionBlitz platform. Zero-day options expire the same day that they are purchased, allowing traders to take advantage of ultra short-term trades, which they can enter &amp; exit almost instantaneously.&nbsp;</p><p>The OptionBlitz platform also features various American &amp; European options with maturities from 24h down to as low as 10 seconds, allowing for highly-customizable trading control. The liquidity Provider program is another great feature that offers traders excellent returns, boosted by up to +50% when USDC capital is staked with the platform&rsquo;s native BLX token.</p><h2><strong>What About Perpetual Turbo?</strong></h2><p>OptionBlitz is currently the only platform that offers <a href="https://optionblitz.co/#turbos">Perpetual Turbo Options</a>. Turbos are an exciting new form of derivative which are like a cross between a perpetual futures contract and an option. Instead of paying margin, the trader pays an initial outlay depending on the leverage selected. Turbos have different characteristics to other perpetuals, including:</p><ul><li>1:200 Leverage</li><li>No Margin</li><li>No expiration</li><li>Fixed 0.1% TX Fee</li><li>0% Slippage&nbsp;</li></ul><p>No margin means no margin calls, so highly volatile markets can be supported even with high leverage. A Turbo is liquidated by the risk engine if its barrier level is touched, the barrier level is set according to the leverage selected and it moves according to a funding rate mechanism.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Social Trading &amp; BLX Token Economy</strong></h2><p><a href="https://optionblitz.co/">OptionBlitz</a> has integrated numerous features to promote community growth through social trading. The platform uses a Web 3.0-enabled in-app chat, deep social sentiment analytics, free trading signals, and indicators &mdash; all built around the platform&rsquo;s BLX token economy and incentive model.

After a crypto winter that lasted more than a year, the quotes of the main cryptocurrencies soared. A huge wave of new cryptocurrency supporters will soon cover the market. Most of them want to quickly enter the market to take advantage of financial innovations, invest and earn successfully, and at the same time minimize risks. Until recently, this was impossible, because experience comes from mistakes and losses, and successful trading on the exchange requires a long-term education. The world of crypto can be overwhelming and complicated for those who are just starting out. They need not only a user-friendly interface but also comprehensive educational resources that make the world of cryptocurrency more accessible and less intimidating to beginners. And most importantly, what they need is a way not to lose all their funds by the very first mistake. For a long time, no one could provide such a service. But now the <a href="https://cryptounity.org/">CryptoUnity</a> platform comes. With it, everything could be changed. A new startup with its own CUT token allows beginners to quickly become full participants of the crypto community, start trading quickly and successfully on the exchange, and at the same time, due to the cold storage, they can minimize their risks and not lose their assets even if something is wrong with the exchange.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="977" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/cryptounity.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_977_343.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_900_316.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_720_253.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_600_211.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254602/responsive-images/cryptounity___media_library_original_300_105.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Cool cold wallet</strong></h3><p>Even the most secure exchanges get hacked from time to time. We regularly hear about this in the news from the cryptocurrency market. When hackers break into an exchange, the users usually lose all their funds placed on their exchange accounts. And even reliable and convenient online wallets cannot guarantee the complete safety of funds. There is only one way to store digital assets securely, and that is with a cold wallet. A cold wallet is not connected to the internet and therefore stands a far lesser risk of being compromised. In other words, this is an offline wallet or a hardware wallet. A cold wallet is the only way of holding cryptocurrency offline to prevent hackers from being able to access the owner&#8217;s holdings via traditional internet-hacking means. And more: even if you lose your cold wallet, but still have your seed phrase, you can get another hardware wallet and access your assets.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="977" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/asset.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_977_464.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_900_427.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_720_342.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_600_285.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254603/responsive-images/asset___media_library_original_300_142.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Most often, a cold wallet looks like a flash drive and is connected to a computer via a USB port. But there is a more convenient version of a cold wallet, that looks like a traditional bank card and accesses the Internet using NFC. Such a cold wallet provides the full functionality of a hardware wallet while remaining very convenient to use. And this is exactly what the new generation of users is accustomed to. The card with NFC can be easily carried with you wherever you go, allowing for quick and secure access to your funds at any time. This combination of beginner-friendliness and top-level security makes the <a href="https://cryptounity.org/">CryptoUnity</a> platform the go-to destination for anyone looking to get involved in the world of cryptocurrency.</p><h3><strong>Trust and transparency</strong></h3><p>It is known that the crypto finance system built on the blockchain provides a trustless solution. But you still have to trust the solution providers. CryptoUnity successfully completed several audits including QuillAudits in September 2022 and an audit by CertiK in November 2022. While undergoing a due diligence audit with CertiK, the CryptoUnity team also received a KYC Golden badge, demonstrating the highest level of transparency and trust. The combination of user-friendly interface and security provided by cold wallet was highly appreciated by the Auditor. At the end of the year, CertiK published a shortlist of recently evaluated 5 new cryptocurrency projects and evaluated them on their trust scores. The CryptoUnity&#8217;s trust score put it in the top rate of all projects, per the security audit. With a trust score of 89, the cryptocurrency exchange platform comes in first.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="977" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/logos.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_977_124.jpg 977w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_900_114.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_720_91.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_600_76.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/254604/responsive-images/logos___media_library_original_300_38.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>What next?</strong></h3><p>The newbie-oriented project provides two main user needs: security and education. They are complemented by an original and effective affiliate program &#8211; BAPP (Blockchain Affiliate Partner Program), which solves three problems at once: provides an influx of new users; builds trust in the community; and allows users to access additional passive income, where they can earn up to 10% of the value from transactions made by their followers using their code. . Further development of the project, according to the team, will be based on the feedback from their users. This means that CryptoUnity will continue to be able to meet the needs of both experienced and new users who will, like a wave, come to the cryptocurrency market due to its revival.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1280" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54.jpeg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_1280_675.jpeg 1280w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_1200_633.jpeg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_900_475.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_720_380.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_600_316.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/103535/255126/responsive-images/photo-2023-02-03-23-12-54___media_library_original_300_158.jpeg 300w"></figure>

The tokens will be allocated proportionally based on the achievements of the top five (5) top participants.&nbsp;</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1st place : &euro;35 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2nd place : &euro;25 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3rd place : &euro;20 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4th place : &euro;10 000 KLX</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5th place : &euro;10 000 KLX</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">To participate in the Kalima developer Airdrop, participants must first fill out the registration form, which is available on the Kalima website at <a href="https://www.kalima.io">www.kalima.io</a>. They will then receive all the instructions and steps to follow to participate to the competition via e-mail.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All the steps for the participation of the airdrop are detailed in <a href="https://medium.com/@Kalima_KLX/how-to-participate-in-kalima-blockchains-100-000-developer-airdrop-5cecbc485ed7">this article</a>, on the <a href="https://medium.com/@Kalima_KLX">Medium page</a> of Kalima. Kalima&rsquo;s Social Media pages and communication channels will be giving the updates on the competition during and prior to it, so it is important to <a href="https://linktr.ee/Kalima_KLX">follow Kalima</a> online and keep track of the updates.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This event comes about as Kalima prepares the listing of its native token, the KLX, on the BitMart Exchange on February 2<sup>nd</sup> 2023.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Participating in the inaugural Kalima Developer Airdrop</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">The prize aggregation makes participation worthwhile. Even though the winner has an excellent incentive, others coming in close will also be fairly rewarded for their efforts. Developers will be required to build software applications and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Kalima blockchain and test them for performance for a chance to claim the prize.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">These protocols must be consistent with the overall goals of the Developer Airdrop. Developers will be able to build embedded blockchain projects or multichain projects using Kalima as the second layer for Tezos or the Lightning Network. Builders can, for example, create smart rewarding systems for indoor air quality or systems aligned with sustainability practices such as carbon measurement, tracking, and credentialing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Participants may choose from the following topics to base their projects:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Embedded blockchain project</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Multichain using Kalima as second layer for Tezos or Lightning Network</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Gaming</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Micro Payments</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Smart rewarding systems (e.g., Indoor air quality Smart Rewarding)</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Auditable Data (i.e., carbon tracking)</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Physical NFTs</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Building the Kalima Blockchain Community</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">As a low-cost, high-speed, and scalable rival to other Enterprise Blockchain projects, Kalima provides unmatched&nbsp;modularity and independence in the race to become the ultimate Blockchain for IoT (BIoT) network. Both beginners and developers with smart contract&nbsp;experience benefit from its high degree of composability, as the Kalima API is available in many programming languages.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Whether it is for businesses as a whole, or for builders wanting to benefit from the Kalima Network, building dApps and on the ecosystem will be a natural process, which will be supported by the Kalima foundation. Kalima has a close support system available for enterprise adopting Kalima Blockchain, with a formation time and program that has been proved to be one of the most efficient in the industry.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, throughout the years the Kalima foundation will host a number of hackathons and developer airdrops to assist developers in honing their skills, starting with the inaugural Kalima Developer Airdrop. These may take place online, or physically in one of the three regions Kalima is operating in : Europe, the U.S.A. and the U.A.E..</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima has also allocated an important amount of tokens for its planned developer grant program, in which in-house and external developers will be rewarded handsomely for adopting the Kalima Network and creating dApps on it, either for their own programs, or for third parties. This program is set to be launched for the seven years following the Kalima listing on the Bitmart Exchange on February 2<sup>nd</sup> 2023.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the Kalima foundation will incentivize the deployment of PrivaChains in its initial stage, by rewarding the first one thousand PrivaChain owners, in ten rounds, on a first-come-first-served basis. About 20 billion KLX have been put aside for this incentive program, with the rewarding set in a descending order, meaning the 10 first owners will earn more than the following volley of owners and so on.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About Kalima</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima, a layer 1 third-generation blockchain, is a rapidly expanding ecosystem that will enable enterprises, developers, and startups to build the future of Web3 Enterprise and Data Governance applications, specifically with IoT (Internet of Things) data, to solve real-world problems.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Users can independently govern, manage, and monetize data using Kalima&#8217;s decentralized network of permissioned blockchains (PrivaChains), as well as create tokens for smart-rewarding systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima is a modular concept which allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that are hosted on PrivaChains. Kalima was designed for the creation of dApps, with the goal of generating new business models or improving existing ones, ranging from data notarization to decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization (NFTs), data monetization, and industrial IoT applications (Digital Twins, Predictive Maintenance, Smart Infrastructure, and so on).&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kalima&#8217;s blockchain is built to handle very large amounts of sensitive data generated by industries collecting data via IoT sensors and analyzing that data in real-time. The PrivaChains will be able to connect to one another as well as to other leading public chains (Tezos, Lightning, Polygon, and Cosmos hubs), boosting Kalima&#8217;s industrial adoption.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To learn more about Kalima, be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.kalima.io">www.kalima.io</a> website.

That&rsquo;s why now it&rsquo;s more important than ever to understand what data breaches are, how they happen, and how to <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">prevent them</a>.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most websites store user data in some shape or form. When they experience a data breach, controlling the spread of the compromised data becomes very difficult. The effects of a data breach can be devastating, with permanently damaged online reputation or even identity theft.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For crypto traders, a password breach might mean a substantial financial loss. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essential to understand more about data breaches and how to <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">protect your passwords</a> &ndash; and your money.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How data breaches happen</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Data breaches can occur in several ways and for many reasons. A malicious party outside the organization is typically to blame &ndash; but someone within an organization can also cause them.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a data breach happens within the organization, it&rsquo;s often the result of an unintentional accident, human error, or infrastructural weaknesses. However, they can also be insider jobs &ndash; a data breach deliberately carried out by someone within the company.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a data breach happens due to a malicious party targeting the organization, it&rsquo;s known as a deliberate attack. These deliberate attacks may involve techniques like ransomware, phishing, social engineering tactics, SQL injection, or brute-force attacks.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Stolen credentials &ndash; the most common cause of data breaches&nbsp;</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Unsurprisingly, stolen or leaked credentials are most commonly responsible for data breaches.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a password is stolen or leaked, it becomes available to unauthorized parties and can be used to access various personal or business accounts. Cybercriminals can steal passwords in several ways, including keylogger programs, phishing, social engineering, brute-force attacks, and, sometimes, simply guesswork.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A stolen password can have severe consequences for users and organizations, exposing accounts to cybercriminals and potentially causing significant financial losses.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The biggest data breaches of 2022</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">This year has seen many major data breaches exposing the data of millions of customers. Here are some of the most significant incidents this year to date:&nbsp;</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>January 17, 2022: </strong>Hackers broke into almost 500 crypto traders&rsquo; wallets on crypto.com and stole $18 million in bitcoin and $15 million in Ethereum.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>March 21, 2022:</strong> The Lapsus$ hacker group breached the authentication company Okta, affecting 2.5% of the company&rsquo;s customers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>March 23, 2022: </strong>Cybercriminals successfully stole $625 million in cryptocurrency from the makers of Axie Infinity.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>July 21, 2022:</strong> Hackers breached the data of approximately 5.4 million Twitter users and put it on sale with their phone numbers and email addresses.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How can cybercriminals use stolen data?</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Hackers can use stolen data in many ways, some of which are worse than others. What criminals do with stolen data largely depends on whether it&rsquo;s business or personal.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Personal information</strong></h2><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sell it for profit.</strong> Cybercriminals may put stolen data up for sale on the dark web. According to <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/heres-how-much-your-personal-information-is-selling-for-on-the-dark-web/">Experian</a>, criminals can sell data for anywhere between $1 to $2,000.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Steal money or commit financial fraud. </strong>Stolen data may give attackers access to bank or investment accounts &ndash; a relatively easy way to steal the user&rsquo;s money.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Commit identity theft. </strong>Hackers may use stolen data to open new credit cards or file a tax return under the victim&rsquo;s identity.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cause damage on social media. </strong>Cybercriminals may also use stolen data to access the victim&rsquo;s social media accounts. They may share posts as the victim or contact their friends and followers to ask for money.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">In most cases, the victim will have to jump through hoops to restore their life to how it used to be, including contacting the authorities, changing all login credentials, and notifying family and friends.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Corporate information</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Stolen corporate information can have a devastating effect on an organization&rsquo;s reputation too.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a significant data breach occurs, users may lose trust in an organization and its ability to handle their information securely. This loss of confidence can seriously impact the business long-term, causing irreversible reputation damage.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, stolen corporate information may also lead to major financial losses, like in the cases of the data breaches listed above. Overall, data breaches pose serious risks &ndash; whether at an individual or corporate level.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How to prevent a data breach</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Individuals and organizations can prevent data breaches in various ways, including:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Keeping <strong>software up to date.</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;">Being mindful of <strong>phishing attacks.</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shredding documents</strong> with personal or financial information.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Only using <strong>secure websites.</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify;">Checking <strong>credit reports</strong>.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">However, since most data breaches happen due to weak or stolen passwords, let&rsquo;s look at how to improve your passwords.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Improve your password security</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">Password security</a> is vital in data breach prevention. Strong passwords are much harder to crack and will be more effective in keeping your accounts safe. Here are some tips for password security:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Create unique passwords that are at least 12 characters long.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Use lower and uppercase letters and a combination of letters and numbers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Include at least one special character. The longer and more complex your password is, the harder it becomes for hackers to guess or crack it.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Keep your passwords safe. Using a reliable password manager could help you always create strong, uncrackable passwords and store them in a secure, encrypted place. Password managers can help avoid human errors and make your accounts more secure.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Data breach prevention tips for crypto wallets</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">With crypto trading becoming more popular, crypto-related data breaches are increasing too. Protect your crypto wallets with strong passwords as your first line of defense. Here are some tips for keeping your crypto wallets safe:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Create complex passwords. </strong>Malicious tools for brute force attacks and password guessing are easily accessible to hackers. If your passwords aren&rsquo;t strong enough, hackers may be able to break into your crypto trading account and empty your wallet.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Use unique passwords. </strong>Don&rsquo;t use the same password on several accounts. Unique passwords are also essential because of the risk of third-party data breaches. One email account could compromise all shared passwords if it suffers a breach.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Use a password manager. </strong>Remember your complex and strong passwords with a password manager. These helpful cybersecurity tools let you store, autofill, and save as many strong passwords as you want. Your passwords are easily accessible on any device &ndash; but only to you.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About NordPass</strong></h2><p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=504&amp;aff_id=74417&amp;url_id=9358">NordPass</a> is a highly rated password manager created by Nord Security &ndash; a global company specializing in personal and business cybersecurity solutions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">NordPass allows users to store, autosave, and autofill unique, complex passwords to secure their online accounts.
