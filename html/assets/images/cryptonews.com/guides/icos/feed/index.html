The market saw 235 ICOs in 2017, five times more than in 2016. They helped raise over&#8230;</p><figure class="center" style="max-width: 670px"><img src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/ebe2057944.png" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 670px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/ebe2057944.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c6/ebe2057944.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c6/ebe2057944.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c6/ebe2057944.png 900w" alt="What Is ICO" class="content-img"><figcaption>IWhat Is ICO? Image source: vectorpouch / freepik.com</figcaption></figure><p>If you are interested in learning &lsquo;&rsquo;what is ICO&rsquo;&rsquo; and looking for &#8220;what is ICO guide,&#8221; you came to the right place. This article will help you to understand what is ICO, how does it work, its risks, and benefits.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-ico">What Is an ICO</h2><p><b>ICO</b> stands for <b>Initial Coin Offering</b>. It is a new way to raise capital for all sorts of blockchain-related projects by selling cryptocurrency. New projects use it to sell freshly minted crypto tokens in exchange for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ether</a>, other cryptocurrencies, and, at times, fiat. In a way, it resembles <b>Initial Public Offerings (IPO)</b>, except that ICO&rsquo;s are mostly unregulated and grant little to none rights to investors.</p><p>So why would anyone buy or launch an ICO? There are several ways how ICO&rsquo;s can be beneficial for their stakeholders.</p><h2 id="ico-benefits">ICO Benefits</h2><p>The investors can enjoy the following benefits:</p><ul><li>An opportunity to obtain new cryptocurrency for a low cost in hopes to get good returns on their investment (sort of like buying Bitcoin in 2011). </li><li>ICO coins may come with additional benefits, like revenue redistribution or privileged access to projects products and services.</li><li>Ability to support projects and teams you like. </li></ul><p>Meanwhile, token issuers get:</p><ul><li>Quick access to seed funding with fewer regulatory restrictions.</li><li>Funds without any loss of equity unless stated otherwise. </li><li>Opportunity to create and experiment with innovative decentralized business models.</li><li>An initial user-base which is eager to test the service.</li></ul><figure class="center" style="max-width: 554px"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 554px, 100vw" alt="What Is An ICO" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fcd5d7fca0.jpeg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fcd5d7fca0.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c6/fcd5d7fca0.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c6/fcd5d7fca0.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c6/fcd5d7fca0.jpeg 900w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2 id="ico-risks">ICO Risks</h2><p>Needless to say, ICO&rsquo;s come with a fair share of risks, too. For example, token buyers have to face:</p><ul><li>Relatively inexperienced team with no guarantee that the project will fulfill its promises.</li><li>No regulatory protection and guarantee of returns.</li><li>Limited transparency on project development and progress.</li><li>The risk of the project being an elaborate scam or pump and dump scheme.</li></ul><p>At the site time, ICO initiators take a risk due to:</p><ul><li>Uncertain regulations that may result in fines or sentences.</li><li>An unstable investment which comes from the volatility of cryptocurrencies. </li><li>Little to none information about the token holders. </li></ul><p>At the end of the article, you can find a list of symptoms that may indicate the ICO project is a scam. Now, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at how ICOs came to be.</p><h2 id="a-brief-history-of-icos">A Brief History of ICOs</h2><p>ICO history began in 2013 when the first one was held by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/mastercoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastercoin</a>, a digital currency and communications protocol. It raised approx. $5 million. Soon it was followed by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> ICO, which managed to raise around $18 million at the time.</p><p>Since 2014, the ICO market was steadily growing but didn&rsquo;t see an explosion until 2017-2018.  It saw 875 ICOs in 2017 alone, almost 30 times more than in 2016. They helped raise over $6.2 billion, compared with $96 million in 2016. Still, the record year for ICO&rsquo;s was 2018 with more than 1200 ICOs which resulted in $7.85 billion raised. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rIMKNkF6d28" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The largest ICO to date is that of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/eos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS</a>, a decentralized application network, which raised over $4 billions in several rounds during 2017 and 2018. Since the ICO explosion in 2017 and 2018, the interest in ICO&rsquo;s began to wane. </p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="ICO statistics" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fd1b359db3.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fd1b359db3.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c6/fd1b359db3.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c6/fd1b359db3.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c6/fd1b359db3.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c6/fd1b359db3.png 1386w"><figcaption>ICO launch statistics. Source: Coinschedule.com</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-does-ico-work?">How does ICO work?</h2><p>A project or a company specifies its intentions to hold an ICO by publishing a so-called whitepaper. It explains the project, its goals, how much capital it needs to raise when the ICO is scheduled, and other information to help investors decide whether to participate.</p><p>In exchange for making an investment, an investor gets the project&rsquo;s cryptocurrency, usually referred to as a token. Depending on the project, tokens may be acquired in exchange for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money like US dollars, euros, and so on.</p><p>Most of the ICO tokens are issued on dapp platforms. As of 2019 February, the most popular token issuance platform is Ethereum. </p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="ICO platforms" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fd38de845d.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fd38de845d.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c6/fd38de845d.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c6/fd38de845d.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c6/fd38de845d.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c6/fd38de845d.png 953w"><figcaption>ICO token issuance platforms ranked by popularity. Source: ICObench.com</figcaption></figure><p>ICOs let startups and other companies raise capital much more easily than, for example, by selling shares or bonds or getting loans. The market is still largely unregulated, and they don&rsquo;t need to deal with venture capitalists or banks. Going forward, however, raising capital via an ICO can be expected to become more and more complicated as the market matures and new regulations are introduced.</p><h2 id="are-icos-legal?">Are ICOs Legal?</h2><p>The answer is maybe. There is no clear regulatory framework regarding ICO&rsquo;s yet, so it is an utterly gray area. In the future it is likely to be regulated; therefore, most ICO&rsquo;s are required to comply with KYC/AML rules. As of now, it&rsquo;s too difficult to impose any limits, since most officers are hesitant to put restrictions on a potentially world-changing technology.</p><p>United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) treats ICO&rsquo;s differently. If the token being sold is merely a utility token, it does not classify as financial security. However, if the token has qualities of an equity coin with a sole purpose to appreciate in value and benefit its investors, then it can be treated as security and must comply with the legal processes. </p><p>At the end of the day, until a regulatory framework is imposed, most people will continue to use ICO&rsquo;s as a tool for fundraising. </p><h2 id="how-to-identify-a-scam-ico">How to Identify a Scam ICO</h2><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="How to recognize scam ico" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fd61d4dd01.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c6/fd61d4dd01.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c6/fd61d4dd01.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c6/fd61d4dd01.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c6/fd61d4dd01.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c6/fd61d4dd01.jpg 1280w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>An exit scam ICOs are quite popular so the ability to identify them can save you much money. <br>
According to Ernst &amp; Young, almost 10% of all funds raised by ICO&rsquo;s end up in the scammers&#8217; wallets.</p><p>However, there are ways to identify fraudulent ICO. Look for these common signals:</p><ul><li><b>Anonymous team.</b> Many scams do not publicize their team, so no one can verify who is related to the project. It is a major red flag.</li><li><b>An offer seems to too good to be true.</b> If the project offers you ludicrous returns or impossible products, that&rsquo;s a major red flag. </li><li><b>No roadmap.</b> A serious startup always plans ahead and is open about its further steps. If the future of the project is concealed, it&rsquo;s probably non-existent. </li><li><b>Bitcointalk.org thread.</b> A legit way to launch an ICO is by announcing it on BitcoinTalk.org. It is the largest forum for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and legitimate projects will gladly participate in the discussions and answer all the questions.</li><li><b>Code.</b> Credible projects will commit their code to Github where everyone can review it. No code, no project.</li><li><b>Is the token or blockchain necessary?</b> Many projects can function well without a distributed ledger. Many projects try to take advantage of ICO&rsquo;s just to collect extra money. So ask yourself, does it really need its own coin?</li><li><b>PR and media activity.</b> Trustworthy projects hire qualified marketing specialists who manage to create an active, engaged community. Also, it is always a good sign if the project gets positive mentions in quality publications.</li></ul><p>Remember not all ICOs are scams, and they also provide a legit way to raise funds for legit and cool projects.  </p><p><i>

Although the interest in the ICOs is waning, the reasons to participate in token sales remain the same.</p><p><b>Main reasons behind investing in an ICO</b></p><p><b>Profit</b> and <b>the opportunity to participate in ambitious projects</b> are the primary reasons behind investing in ICOs.</p><p>Backing a crowdfunded project, by comparison, basically means donating money. And in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) &ndash; the traditional way of raising capital on a stock exchange &ndash; an investor gets shares in a company, which come with voting rights and the right to dividends.</p><p>In an ICO, also known as a &ldquo;crowdsale,&rdquo; investors acquire tokens that may offer them various benefits. They expect the project they are investing in to become successful and the value of its token to increase. The Ethereum blockchain project, for example, raised USD 18 million in bitcoins in 2014 by selling its coin ether for USD 0.40. In December 2017 the price of ether stood at about USD 750. In other words, if you had bought USD 100 worth of ether coins during the ICO in 2014, your investment would have been worth more than USD 187,000 in December 2017.</p><p><b>Other reasons to invest in an ICO</b></p><p>An increase in value, however, is not the only benefit an ICO investor can expect. As has been explained by Smith+Crown, a research company specialized in blockchain and crypto finance, tokens generally give their holders various rights, and individual tokens can confer multiple types of rights.</p><p>Such rights can include:</p><ul><li><b>Payment rights</b>, where the token is the only means of payment for a platform or service.</li><li><b>Access rights</b>, where the token is required in order to be able to use the platform.</li><li><b>Profit or fee rights</b>, where holders of a token get a portion of revenues or profits.</li><li><b>Contribution rights</b>, where tokens holders are allowed to play a role in maintaining the network that doesn&rsquo;t involve creating blocks for a blockchain.</li><li><b>Block creation rights</b>, where tokens determine who secures the project&rsquo;s blockchain.</li><li><b>Governance rights</b>, where token holders can influence project features, direction, protocol and more.</li></ul><p>What rights come with particular ICO tokens should be specified in the ICO website or whitepaper. </p><p>In either case, hopefully, this answers your question &lsquo;&rsquo;Why should I invest in ICO&rsquo;&rsquo;.

If you want to learn about the risks in an ICO and how to minimize them, this a quick guide is the right place to start.</p><h2>Why Are ICOs Risky?</h2><p>The cryptocurrency market is still under-regulated. That means investors may be left on their own if an ICO turns out to be a fraud or the project fails. Neither of these scenarios is uncommon, and with immutable transactions and insufficient regulations, you can only trust yourself to make the right financial decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, the holders of an ICO may end up trapped by financial regulations, too. For example, many ICOs had to be moved or delayed due to infamous China&rsquo;s ban on ICOs and exchanges back in 2017.</p><h4>ICO Buyers Risks</h4><p>As you can see, both ICO organizers and investors have to face many potential risks. On the buyers&#8217; side of things these include:</p><ul><li>Investing in relatively inexperienced teams with an unproven (experimental) business model and a high risk of default.</li><li>No regulatory protection.</li><li>Limited transparency regarding project progress and issues.</li><li>The risk of investing in an elaborate scam or pump and dump scheme.</li><li>It may be difficult to grasp the full picture of the ICO before you invest.</li><li>The value of ICO tokens can be purely speculative and experience wild fluctuations.</li><li>The hype of an ICO may surpass its actual utility.</li></ul><h4>ICO Organizers Risks</h4><p>At the site time, ICO owners take a risk due to:</p><ul><li>Uncertain regulations which may result in fines, extra costs, or sentences.</li><li>Uncertain regulatory difference between utility and security tokens.</li><li>Unstable investment currencies that may devalue extremely fast.</li><li>Little to none information about the token holders.</li><li>The interest in ICOs has been waning ever since early 2018.</li><li>Responsibility if projects security is compromised and it ends up harming the investors.</li><li>Risk of issuing incorrect documentation in regulated states.</li></ul><p>As a result, both ICO organizers and potential investors need to consider the risks carefully.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not, in fact, rare for ICO teams to merely run off with investors&rsquo; money, and it&rsquo;s not rare for ICOs to receive fines and regulatory obstacles after they ended. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that all ICO&rsquo;s are invalid and should be avoided. There are still some decent projects out there, but you need to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="ICO Red Flag" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/53fca063fc.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/53fca063fc.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c7/53fca063fc.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c7/53fca063fc.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c7/53fca063fc.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c7/53fca063fc.png 1920w"></figure><h2>How To Identify Fraudulent ICOs</h2><p>If you see an ICO project you want to invest and would like to minimize the risk while doing so, look out for the potential red flags:</p><p>&#8211; The people behind the project are anonymous, use fake identities or have counterfeit accounts on social networks.<br>&#8211; The team lacks professionals with relevant experience.<br>&#8211; There is no legal entity behind the ICO.<br>&#8211; The whitepaper and business plan sound unrealistic and/or lack a detailed analysis of the market and competitors.<br>&#8211; The project&rsquo;s authors do not provide an example of their blockchain code.<br>&#8211; There is no working prototype.<br>&#8211; There is no escrow wallet for delivering investors&rsquo; money to developers (preferably in portions) only when certain criteria are met.<br>&#8211; The project doesn&rsquo;t commit any code to Github.&nbsp;<br>&#8211; The project doesn&rsquo;t have a clear roadmap.<br>&#8211; There is little to none credible PR or media activity or positive mentions of the project.&nbsp;<br>&#8211; The token or blockchain doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary to reach the project&rsquo;s goals.</p><p>At the end of the day, you have to do your own research and figure out for yourself whether the ICO is credible or not. Try to avoid projects with numerous red flags or the ones which are located in uncertain regulatory environments, and your ICO investment should turn out just fine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Previous &#8211; </i><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-invest-in-an-ico.htm"><i>Why invest in an ICO?</i></a><br><i>Next &#8211; </i><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin.htm"><i>What is Bitcoin?</i></a></p><p><i>Have any suggestions about this entry?</i><a href="https://cryptonews.com/have-a-story.htm"><i>Let us know.</i></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Following 2017/18 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-ico.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initial Coin Offering</a> (ICO) craze, IEOs are becoming a new mania which is capturing the middle ground between promising projects and eager investors.</p><p>IEOs are exciting phenomena. They are more secure than ICOs, more accessible than <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-security-token-offering-sto.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security token offerings</a> (STOs), and there&acirc;&#128;&#153;s particular due diligence done by the IEO platform before listing the projects. All these factors raise investors&#8217; confidence in the projects, which results in millions raised in seconds, overbooked platforms, and new, promising projects and coins entering the cryptoverse. </p><h2 id="desirable-characteristics-of-ieo-platforms">Desirable characteristics of IEO platforms</h2><p>In our &acirc;&#128;&#156;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-initial-exchange-offering.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is an IEO</a>?&acirc;&#128;&#157; guide we&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve counted more than 32 IEO platforms. All of them are different, and some of them are better than others. One must mind that most exchanges have a monetary incentive to launch as many IEOs as possible as they make good money by doing so. This raises a fundamental question &#8211; which IEO platforms are the best? </p><p>These are the key factors to pay attention to when choosing an IEO platform:</p><ol type="1"><li><b>Exchange/platform reputation.</b> Credibility and reputation of exchange are the most crucial factors when choosing an IEO platform. Since exchanges vet all IEO projects, you have to trust them completely. IEOs provide lucrative opportunities for the exchanges, and all IEO profits come from eager investors like you. Therefore, you have to look for exchanges that are genuinely focused on the quality of the projects instead of useless token sales. Always do your own research (DYOR).</li><li><b>Ease of use.</b> Participation in an IEO should be as frictionless as possible. Unlike ICOs, IEOs are mediated by the exchanges, so it is their responsibility to make it accessible even for novice investors. </li><li><b>Liquidity.</b> A solid IEO platform should have an abundance of investors willing to trade the token. Remember that an IEO token is listed on its exchange almost immediately after the IEO, so you want to be sure that you have no issues when selling it later. </li><li><b>Security and stability.</b> IEOs attract many investors from various backgrounds, so the IEO platform must be robust and secure. No one wants to risk losing their funds to an incompetent exchange, which is prone to all sorts of cyberattacks, technical glitches, or bad performance.  </li><li><b>Multi-coin support.</b> IEOs are an increasingly popular way for exchanges to increase the value of their native token. However, most investors don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t want to be limited to one or two coins when investing, so having multiple options definitely helps.</li></ol><p>Based on these criteria, we&#8217;ve selected the top 5 IEO platforms that are worthy of your attention.</p><h2 id="1.-binance-launchpad">1. Binance Launchpad</h2><figure class="center"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance" target="_blank" class="ignore" rel="noopener"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="IEO platform review Binance" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/2b719d4a3a.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/2b719d4a3a.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cf/2b719d4a3a.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cf/2b719d4a3a.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cf/2b719d4a3a.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cf/2b719d4a3a.jpg 1895w"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance Launchpad</a></b> is the pioneering IEO platform which launched in 2017 just to become mainstream in 2019. It had many successful IEOs, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/matic-matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matic Network (MATIC)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bittorrent-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitTorrent (BTT)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/celer-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celer Network (CELR)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/fetch-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fetch AI (FET)</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bread (BRD)</a>, and others. At pixel time, the average ROI for Binance IEO investors is nearly 580%.</p><p>Binance Launchpad is arguably the best token launch platform on the market. It is backed by one of the top exchange&acirc;&#128;&#153;s in the world and is led by a class act <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>. The launchpad is powered by leading technology (capable of processing over 1,400,00 orders per second) and high-level partnerships, which bring an abundance of investors to every token sale. Hence, liquidity is rarely a problem with Binance. </p><p>In fact, Binance&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Launchpad has attracted so many investors it had to introduce a &acirc;&#128;&#156;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-launchpad-to-test-its-lottery-with-matic-network-3618.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lottery method</a>&acirc;&#128;&#157; to give everyone equal opportunity to invest. In most cases, investors must purchase <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNB (Binance&acirc;&#128;&#153;s native token)</a> to participate. Besides, the platform supports all sorts of languages and devices, making it easier to invest in IEOs regardless of where you are. </p><p>In sum, Binance Launchpad is both a pioneer and a leading IEO platform in the market. Although it requires luck and BNB tokens to enter a sale, its solid relationships with industry leaders, high-profile investors, and industry-leading advisors make it a high-quality platform, which is why it tops our list.</p><p><b><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/binance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Visit Binance</a></b></p><h2 id="2.-gate.io-startup-">2.

This way, there&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a brief 30-minute subscription window before an IEO, which closes if the max limit is reached. Then, the allotment part follows: an investor must hold a minimum of 500 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/okb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKB (OKEx exchange token)</a> for seven days or at least 3,500 OKB at the snapshot time before the token sale.

IEOs are available exclusively to the exchange&rsquo;s users, although some IEOs may take place in several exchanges. Just like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-ico.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICOs</a>, IEOs allow investors to get new cryptocurrencies (or tokens) while raising funds for promising crypto projects.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-initial-exchange-offering-(ieo)?">What is an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)?</h2><p>Many people in the crypto space call Initial Exchange Offerings the next step in ICOs evolution. Since ICOs are unregulated, and most of them turned out to be scams, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-security-token-offering-sto.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STOs</a> were supposed to be a fix. However, most  STOs remain constrained by slow and expensive processes and stifling regulations. IEOs are the middle ground that addresses issues on both sides. </p><p>Although exchange-assisted ICOs were a thing for a while now, IEOs started to gain traction after the launch of Binance Launchpad at the end of 2019. There have already been over 50 IEOs in 2019, which raised over $159 million, as per ICObench.</p><p>IEOs try to promote only legit projects because it puts exchange&rsquo;s credibility at stake. Therefore, the vetting process is more profound. Besides, not every idea manages to get support from an exchange. Also, exchange offerings are more accessible than STOs, which allow almost anyone is free to participate and invest (except for countries with regulatory restrictions, see below), and the token sale team is somewhat less likely to suffer repercussions from regulators due to mandatory investor KYC/AML checks done by the exchange.</p><p>Essentially, IEOs is another way to crowdfund various cryptocurrency startups through a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency exchange</a> acting as a mediator. With the help of crypto exchange, projects manage to get significantly more exposure, interest, and credibility. After a successful IEO, the token issuers pay a listing fee along with an agreed amount of tokens for the use of IEO platform services. Soon, the tokens are listed on the exchange where investors can access instant liquidity.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="What is IEO Crypto" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/8a657b18d9.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/8a657b18d9.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cc/8a657b18d9.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cc/8a657b18d9.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cc/8a657b18d9.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cc/8a657b18d9.jpg 1280w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2 id="characteristics-of-initial-exchange-offerings-(ieo)">Characteristics of Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO)</h2><p>Like ICOs, Initial Exchange Offerings have a limited amount of coins offered for a fixed price, limits on minimum and maximum tokens available for purchase per single user, soft cap and hard cap and dedicated accepted cryptocurrencies.</p><p>However, unlike with ICO tokens, IEO coins are already minted before the crowdsale. Besides, they hit exchanges several days or weeks after its IEO, which makes it more convenient for the investors (instant liquidity). Also, the IEO process naturally involves an intermediary (the IEO platform) which is trusted to handle the funds. However, that also serves to raise investor confidence in the project, which most ICOs lack.</p><h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-an-ieo">Pros and cons of an IEO</h2><p>Essentially, IEOs are advantageous due to:</p><ol type="1"><li><b>Increased investor confidence.</b> Investors do not deal with the IEO project team directly, but with the exchange which makes it more credible and secure in case things go south.</li><li><b>Security for both token issuers and investors.</b> Token issuers gain as well since IEO platforms manage all things related to regulations, such as mandatory KYC/AML checks for every participant.</li><li><b>Frictionless process.</b> IEO platforms ensure almost anyone, regardless of their experience in the crypto space, can easily contribute.</li><li><b>Guaranteed exchange listing.</b> IEO tokens are listed on the IEO exchange soon after the IEO.</li><li><b>Removal of scams.</b> The IEO project teams are neither anonymous nor fake, so they won&rsquo;t disappear after collecting your funds. </li><li><b>Benefits for the projects</b>, like enhanced marketing effort by the exchange, more credibility, exposure, and interest in the project.</li><li><b>Benefits for the exchanges</b>, including new users signing up with them only for the sake of purchasing and trading IEO tokens.</li><li><b>Benefits for the exchange token holders.</b> Most exchanges use IEOs to add another use case for their native token (if they have one) which is likely to raise its value.</li></ol><p>However, IEOs are also the subjects to the following risks and concerns:</p><ol type="1"><li><b>Unclear regulations and restrictions.</b> Many countries have issued restrictions or banned ICOs completely, which may reflect badly on IEOs, too. Although it is a slightly different beast, the core principles of an IEO remain the same.</li><li><b>All investors must comply with AML/KYC.</b> The cryptocurrency community is known to be full of privacy-obsessed individuals, so going through AML/KYC procedure may be a big no-no for some.</li><li><b>Market manipulation and concentration of coins.</b> Most IEO tokens are minted beforehand, so you should always double-check the dynamics of token allocation and distribution before investing. Both the project team and an IEO exchange may keep an unreasonably large portion of tokens to themselves, which may result in meddling with prices later on. Besides, it&rsquo;s no secret that the vast majority of exchanges participate in &ldquo;wash trading.&rdquo;</li><li><b>A limited number of investors.</b> There has been many complains from investors that not everyone manages to purchase tokens during IEOs.</li><li><b>Bots.</b> There is a concern about bots that can be programmed to participate in IEOs and beat out human investors.</li><li><b>FOMO.</b>Remember to do your own research and examine the projects and their ideas yourself. Both IEO project managers and IEO platforms have the incentive to create as much hype as possible to sell all the coins. Be sure to check the project&rsquo;s whitepaper, idea, and whether it even needs a token in the first place.

For instance, Binance Launchpad has introduced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-launchpad-to-test-its-lottery-with-matic-network-3618.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lottery-based token distribution method</a> for the Matic Network IEO.</p><p>Mind that every IEO tends to sell out rather quickly so be quick and ready when the time comes!</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="IEOs Binance Launchpad 2019" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/89ff0bef19.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cc/89ff0bef19.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cc/89ff0bef19.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cc/89ff0bef19.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cc/89ff0bef19.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cc/89ff0bef19.png 1249w"><figcaption>IEOs launched via Binance Launchpad.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="countries-where-ieos-are-illegal">Countries where IEOs are illegal</h2><p>Unfortunately, not everyone is free to participate in IEOs.

But unlike an ICO coin or token, a security token comes with an underlying investment asset, like stocks, bonds, funds or real estate investment trusts (REIT). </p><p>However, there are more differences between ICO and STO. Let&#8217;s take a look at them here.</p><h2 id="how-is-sto-different-from-ico?">How Is STO Different From ICO?</h2><p>First and foremost, most ICOs are meant for raising funds in an unregulated environment. <br>
Most ICOs actually position their offerings as utility tokens to circumvent regulations. Most founders and projects argue that they distribute users tokens to access their decentralized applications (DApps) or native platforms. The main logic here is that the purpose of their coin is usage and not speculation. Such line of reasoning lets ICO projects to avoid regulation and necessary registration with SEC or other strict regulators.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="ICO vs STO process" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/ca7ec65288.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/ca7ec65288.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c7/ca7ec65288.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c7/ca7ec65288.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c7/ca7ec65288.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c7/ca7ec65288.png 1000w"><figcaption>ICO vs STO processes.</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, STOs are launched with regulatory governance in mind.

But what is it, and why is it important?</p><h2 id="what-is-an-sto?">What Is An STO?</h2><p>STO stands for security token offering. It is a process similar to an ICO where an investor exchanges money for coins or tokens representing their investment. However, unlike ICOs, STO&rsquo;s take it a step further and distribute tokens that fall under the status of securities. They are linked to an underlying investment asset in a way like stocks, bonds, real estate investment trusts (REIT) or other funds. </p><p>As such, security token offerings distribute securities. These are tokens that are fungible, negotiable financial instruments with attached monetary value, like a part of property or company.</p><p>Security tokens are not traded on regular token exchanges. Exchanges that want to offer security token trading need to fully comply with regulations, including extensive investigations into token listings, data sharing, and investor onboarding procedures. Thus, security tokens trade on specialized exchanges.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-sto?">What Are The Benefits Of STO?</h2><p>During the 2017-2018 ICO mania, many token issuers have sold investors bags of tokens without any economic rights, value or regard for existing securities laws. </p><p>Security token offerings are meant to be a regulatory compliant alternative to regular token sales. They aim to correct perceived inequalities on the investor side, such as granting security token holders rights to dividends or other predefined revenue streams.</p><p>STO tokens are beneficial to the issuers, too. There is no need to proclaim tokens as being without any intrinsic economic value, and they typically have clearly defined stakeholder obligations regarding the token distribution, issuance procedure, and secondary trades.</p><p>Other advantages that come with security tokens are: </p><ul><li><b>Credibility.</b> ICO space is chaos, to say the least. Many people were scammed, even more projects did not deliver what they promised, and most investors remain stuck with useless tokens. In contrast, STOs follow all regulations and allow blockchain and cryptocurrencies to restore some credibility.</li><li><b>Improving traditional finance.</b> While traditional securities are slow and expensive due to their old infrastructure and layers of intermediaries, security tokens facilitate services at a lower cost. </li><li><b>Programmability.</b> Security tokens can be programmable and enforced by smart contracts. </li><li><b>Free market.</b> Borders or local regulations do not limit security tokens. </li><li><b>Many investors.</b> Traditional security deals involve only local individuals, while security tokens are open to anyone on the internet. </li><li><b>Reduced institutional manipulation.</b> Free and open market with fewer mediators should reduce market manipulation, at least in theory.</li><li><b>More liquidity.</b> Security tokens will trade on specialized security exchanges so investors will have a convenient way to liquidate their assets. </li></ul><p>Most importantly, security tokens and STOs allow companies to create a new set of stakeholders with novel permutations of debt, equity or contributor roles. </p><p>As such, security tokens are generally considered an improvement over ICOs. They address the fundamental flaws surrounding utility token sales and have the potential to improve traditional securities. </p><h2 id="how-to-determine-if-a-token-is-a-security?">How To Determine if a Token Is A Security?</h2><figure class="center" style="max-width: 660px"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 660px, 100vw" alt="The Howey Test" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/ca0269910e.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/ca0269910e.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c7/ca0269910e.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c7/ca0269910e.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c7/ca0269910e.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c7/ca0269910e.png 660w"><figcaption>Source: Congressional Research Service</figcaption></figure><p>The most common method to differentiate securities from utility tokens is by using <b>The Howey Test</b>. Its title refers to a 1946 US Supreme Court case involving the Howey Company of Florida. In brief, the company decided to lease half of its property to speculators based on the assumption that it would generate profit for them as a result of someone else&#8217;s labor but failed to register the transactions with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  </p><p>When the case finally arrived at the Supreme Court, it was deemed unprecedented and required a new method to assess what constitutes a security. Hence, The Howey Test came into fruition. </p><p>According to the test, a transaction is considered a security if it meets the following criteria:</p><ol type="1"><li>It is an investment of money. </li><li>The investment is in a common enterprise. </li><li>There is an expectation of profit from the work of the promoters or the third party.</li></ol><p>A token that passes the Howey Test is treated a security token.</p><h2 id="difference-between-security-tokens-and-tokenized-securities">Difference Between Security Tokens and Tokenized Securities</h2><p>Mistaking security tokens for tokenized securities is easy. </p><p>The critical difference between the two is that security tokens are newly issued securities that function on distributed ledger while tokenized securities are just token representations of already existing financial products. Basically, if you issued a new financial product with security features, it is a security token. If you take an existing asset and wrap it in a token, it is a tokenized security. </p><p>Despite a similar appearance and terminology, issuing security tokens has nothing to do with tokenized securities.</p><h2 id="a-brief-history-of-security-token-offerings">A Brief History Of Security Token Offerings</h2><p>The first security token offering was launched by Blockchain Capital (BCAP) on April 10, 2017. The STO raised $10,000,000 in a single day. Since then, STOs have continued to gain traction throughout 2018 and 2019 to this day. Here&rsquo;s a brief timeline which showcases several other notable STOs.</p><figure class="center"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="A Brief History of STOs" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/c9e5fb9a71.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c7/c9e5fb9a71.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c7/c9e5fb9a71.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c7/c9e5fb9a71.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c7/c9e5fb9a71.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c7/c9e5fb9a71.png 778w"><figcaption>Source: Security Token Overview Series / Smith+Crown</figcaption></figure><h2 id="sto-launch-platforms">STO Launch Platforms</h2><p>The leading projects that assist businesses with launching their STO are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/polymath-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polymath</a> (POLY)</li><li>Securitize</li><li><b>Harbor</b></li><li><b>Swarm</b></li></ul><p>Usually, they help companies with STOs in terms of regulatory assistance, processes, token issuance, and other related matters. </p><h2 id="can-you-participate-in-an-sto?">Can You Participate In An STO?</h2><p>In the United States, STOs are for accredited investors only. However, if you live outside of the US, the accredited investor rule does not apply to you, and you can participate in most STOs. However, there might be more specific restrictions that apply, so be sure to check with your local jurisdiction before investing.</p>
