It is much easier than farming in real life, though it boasts a tad bit more risk and is a little more complex. This guide will show you all of the strategies, pros, and cons of yield farming.</p><h2>What Is Yield Farming?</h2><p>Yield farming is a way to earn passive income. The process goes like this: you provide a token as liquidity to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm"><u>decentralized exchange (DEX)</u></a>. That DEX will pay you interest on the liquidity that you have provided which comes mainly from its customers&#8217; fees for certain transactions like borrowing, swapping coins/tokens, and trading.</p><p>The fees charged to the customer are typically sent to a pool of investors. Investors receive returns, or, their yield, in proportion to the share of the pool that they held. It is worth noting; those investors in each liquidity pool are only related by providing liquidity in the same token pair.</p><p>Furthermore, the investor, or, liquidity provider can choose to reinvest their profits to gain more yield. The option to reinvest is where yield farming is very lucrative. Having invested x amount of crypto and, had a return larger than your initial investment.&nbsp; The ideal results would look like this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>(Initial investment + interest paid on initial investment) &times; interest paid = exponentially larger yield</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>The process often gives the investor a larger amount of crypto to use as liquidity. Earning a larger percentage of interest from the platform increases their yield. Here&rsquo;s a visual of the general process:</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K1jF4N0cRTkrWymVj4XM2ra4AKKDUoTaLkOJvRo8LcB40PfobQekKB4EY8o9pMAhE69aQo5SxeKNSjZdK-kX6iUketTgZX_WubXw2DmXm34hhuUDNTtpzX3GmQ2BxDwDcoFg5DvV8mmHfvq0QQ" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: Elizabeth Bopp / Cryptonews.com</figcaption></figure><p>Now it is time to take a look at all the other strategies used to grow crypto via yield farming. Last but not least, we&#8217;ll check out the risks involved with each strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Before moving on to comparing strategies, check out this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm"><u>guide</u></a> that gives a simple definition of yield farming, which goes like this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Yield farming, to put it in very basic terms, is when your funds are stored and you gain rewards. These rewards are sometimes paid in dividends. Usually, these rewards are high, and can even double your original input, but they come with high risk. You may double what you put in, but you lose half or more of that as well.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Yield farming is a complex subject for any investor, especially if you&#8217;re a beginner in the space. This video goes into great detail on the subject:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/LaeI5D6NDvw"></oembed></figure><h2>What is a Liquidity Pool?</h2><p>Strategies that involve providing liquidity use a liquidity pool. This means that fees charged by the DEX to its customers are returned to the liquidity pool.&nbsp; This creates more liquidity to the DEX for customers, or market makers, to trade with. A pool, or liquidity pool, is a smart contract known as an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=automated%20market%20maker"><u>Automated Market Maker (AMM</u></a><u>),</u> which can be defined as:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;An automated market maker (AMM) is a fully automated decentralized exchange where trades are made against a pool of tokens called a liquidity pool. An algorithm regulates the values and prices of the tokens in the liquidity pool. Since AMMs do not rely on an active market of buyers and sellers, trades can occur at any time.&rdquo; &nbsp;&#8211; Crypto Glossary at Gemini.com</i></p></blockquote><p>The AMM, or, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contract</a> used in a liquidity protocol holds the funds in the liquidity pool.&nbsp; providing liquidity to the DEX for customers, or market makers, to trade with.</p><p>When a liquidity pool is created, the AMM contract is deployed, that pool is, in a sense, its own market. This is not to be mistaken that the pool will not be affected by the crypto market as a whole. The tokens in the pool will still gain or lose value as they do in real-time in the market. Saying that a liquidity pool is &lsquo;its own market&rsquo; means that the pool itself is vulnerable to manipulation. It is more susceptible to manipulation by liquidity providers. Thus affecting the value of the tokens in that pool. In crypto markets, the value of a coin/token depends on many variables. In a liquidity pool, an individual has more power.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be explained further when discussing the risks of yield farming.</p><h2>Risks of Yield Farming</h2><p>There are many risk factors in yield farming that could leave you sitting high and dry&hellip;in an empty pool. Let&#8217;s go through them one by one.</p><p>Let&#8217;s begin with general risks when investing in decentralized finance. A major risk in investing in a decentralized environment is malicious hackers gaining access to cryptocurrencies and stealing them. While DEXs&rsquo; often have advanced security features, they need time to work out bugs and unfortunately, many adventurous users tend to fall victim to undetected design flaws.</p><p>Another risk that applies to decentralized exchanges is misleading information and price manipulation by whales. Such manipulation is speculated to be the bi-product of inside information being utilized. This causes mistrust in the markets as some trading pairs might be at risk of manipulation by just a few entities.</p><p>Furthermore, if a liquidity provider has a large share of tokens and has reached the end of their locked period, they could remove their share and make the value of that pool go down. In such an instance, the interest the rest of the pool would earn would not be as large because the pool is not as large anymore. DEX/platforms have discovered these flaws and re-structured their lock-up periods in an attempt to eliminate this risk. Still, the volatility of the crypto market plays a key role in all parts of investing in crypto, including yield farming.</p><p>Here is a great infographic showing the risks of blockchain technology as a whole. The risks in the infographic apply to any transactions conducted via blockchains.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/47doZRUoijtjfzBMS-l3m8cpUTYPHUF_YCHBLSSC3GRNCf05XCU8XgPxAah_4Yen8q793P6ul398REduKGSxvIaEzzPuRogP51slytMzSrOJ6ZIhx_ugGcutNFP5sKd8hhY90mDsMi9OYJ8WyQ" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://101blockchains.com/enterprise-blockchain-risk-assesment/">101Blockchains.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>A few more risks that are exclusive to yield farming and liquidity mining are: liquidation aka impermanent loss, and so-called rug pulls.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=impermanent%20loss"><u>Liquidation or impermanent loss</u></a> occurs when the value of the token that was invested into the liquidity pool loses a certain amount of value the DEX will liquidate. This means the platform sells the shares of the liquidity pools to mitigate losses. In liquidity pools, this is also known as an impermanent loss.</p><p>Fintech outlet <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://finbold.com/guide/liquidity-mining-definition/#Risks_of_Liquidity_Mining"><i>Finbold</i></a><i> </i>defines impermanent loss as:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&#8220;<i><strong>.</strong>..suffering a loss in the event that the price of their tokens falls while they are still locked up in the liquidity pool. This is called an impermanent loss since it can only be realized if the miner decides to withdraw the tokens with depressed prices. Sometimes this unrealized loss can be offset by the gains from the LP rewards&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=rug%20pull">Rug Pulls</a> are the double-edged sword of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm">Defi</a>. The risk here is embedded in the peer-to-peer style governance of Defi and the &lsquo;trustless&rsquo; environment that is cultivated. A rug pull is a malicious scheme where either a developer or creator of the DEX or a hacker, withdraws (generally 100% of) funds in the pool, thus liquidating the entire pool and leaving liquidity providers alongside traders&hellip; liquidated&hellip;and without&nbsp;recourse.</p><p>More often than not, the developer, or hacker, revokes the funds of the pool after liquidity providers have re-invested for at least one cycle.</p><p>The scammer will do this so that the liquidity provider trusts the DEX/platform. They wait to pull funds because there is a much larger amount of crypto for them to take. The person(s) running the scheme will more than likely empty the pool. This hurts the liquidity providers as well as the customers who were making trades, exchanging assets, or taking loans on the platform.</p><h2>Other Means of Growing Crypto</h2><p>Yield farming is not the only way that investors are growing their crypto. There are many strategies as well as various terms for those strategies that are sometimes used interchangeably. Here are a few different strategies that share common principles, or work towards common goals as yield farming:</p><ul><li><i><strong><u>Liquidity Mining</u></strong></i></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm"><i><strong><u>Proof-of-Stake (POS) Staking</u></strong></i></a></li></ul><p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at each.</p><h3>What Is Liquidity Mining</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://101blockchains.com/liquidity-mining/"><u>Liquidity mining</u></a> is very similar to yield farming &#8211; the terms are even used interchangeably at times. So what&rsquo;s the difference?</p><p>Liquidity mining is the hands-off version of yield farming. Liquidity mining&rsquo;s main process is very similar to yield farming. One distinct benefit of liquidity mining is that the investor has access to governance. Decentralized platforms allow users to make decisions in their operations.&nbsp; An extra benefit related to liquidity mining that sets it apart from yield farming according to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://101blockchains.com/staking-vs-yield-farming-vs-liquidity-mining/">101blockchains.com</a> is:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;It is important to note that the reward in liquidity mining depends profoundly on the share in total pool liquidity. Furthermore, the newly minted tokens could also offer access to governance of a project alongside prospects for exchanging to obtain other cryptocurrencies or better rewards.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Having governance access to a token is important to someone who believes in a project and wants to be a part of the growth of the token&rsquo;s ecosystem. This is common for tokens built on a blockchain that boasts many projects.</p><h3>Risks of Liquidity Mining</h3><p>Liquidity mining shares the same basic risks as yield farming. Again, the key difference here is in governance access. If tokens in the liquidity pool were lost in the liquidation process, the benefits of governance access that came with having that token would be lost.</p><h2>What Is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Staking?</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm"><u>Proof of Stake</u></a> is a type of consensus algorithm used by high-performance blockchains. This algorithm requires users to keep their native token stored, either in a wallet or DEX, in return for benefits. Here&rsquo;s a more detailed definition of Proof-of-Stake according to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/staking-rewards-pos-blockchains#section-proof-of-stake-explained">Gemini.com</a>:</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>&ldquo;Blockchain networks that use Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms require you to stake tokens to be able to participate in the verification and creation of blocks on a blockchain. Staking on a PoS blockchain network may provide an opportunity to earn passive income on digital assets in the form of block rewards while participating in the governance of the protocol.&rdquo;</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>There is also a<i> </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Proof%20of%20Work%20(PoW)"><u>Proof of Work</u></a> algorithm used by security-optimized blockchains. On Proof-of-Work algorithms, one must perform some sort of task that helps keep the blockchain working to receive benefits. The tasks performed are usually mining, running a validator node, or verifying transactions.</p><p>When staking tokens by the Proof-of-Stake investment model, you are providing liquidity to the DEX/platform. Staking on every platform is different in the amount of time that is required to stake. Sometimes there is the option to pull your tokens at any time. Stakers are paid interest on their stake in the form of the token provided. It can also be a different token that is native to that DEX/platform, if applicable.</p><p>If you want a more in-depth explanation of Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake click<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-proof-of-stake.htm"><u>here</u></a>!</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qoMXG1qC8NMIy7PzcQzwg1SqBH9CawjruKvy6wiHLLSeb3iHEFEmOPcvKGBPW3lnF1rQsxr8L2YwRzrXHhNHX1gmRtLCeMDq_HOCSRiDL-cjYzFgMvL-oDThQPCXyqln4-QtQIovXXcdas3Gkg" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/What-is-proof-of-stake-1.jpg">www.ledger.com</a></figcaption></figure><h2>Risks Involved With Staking</h2><p>Compared to other means of growing crypto discussed in this article, staking is one of the least risky of them. However, with minimal risk come lesser rewards. Proof-of-Stake staking is not free of risk, just like all other investment channels, there are risks involved such as:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;&#8230;slashing, volatility risks, validator risks, and server risks. In addition, you might have to encounter issues of loss or theft of funds, waiting periods for rewards, project failure, liquidity risks, minimum holdings, and extended lock-up periods,&rdquo; </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://101blockchains.com/staking-vs-yield-farming-vs-liquidity-mining/"><i>explains 101blockchains.</i></a></p></blockquote><h2><strong>Closing Thoughts:</strong></h2><p>There are many ways to invest, or, grow your crypto. Everyday there are advances in blockchain technology that provide new investment opportunities. It is important to note that there are great risks involved in each of those opportunities. When considering investing in crypto and, when looking at different strategies for investing, always be diligent in researching potential benefits and risks involved. Consider consulting with a financial advisor if you are not 100% comfortable with crypto investments.&nbsp;</p>

Web3 will allow people to keep ownership of the data we use online. It will all be possible by the use of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">Blockchain technology</a> via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>. Web3 is all about decentralization.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how this concept is evolving.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Web3 Works</h2><p>Web3 &#8216;s mission is to be a decentralized version of the current web. This will come to effect through Blockchain technology. Web3 interactions will be performed with; Transaction hashes, digital and cold storage wallets, and, Web3 Identities.</p><p>Below is a summary with a quick list of characteristics of Web3:</p><ul><li>Verifiable</li><li>Trustless</li><li>Self-Governing</li><li>Permissionless</li><li>Stateful</li><li>Native Built-in Payments</li></ul><p>According to the educational platform <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://deepstash.com/idea/123489/what-is-web-30">Deepstash</a>, web3 developers don&#8217;t build or deploy applications that run on a single server or database managed by a single provider. Instead, these applications run on blockchains and decentralized networks of many peer-to-peer nodes that form a cryptoeconomic protocol.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a visual learner, <i><u>this video</u></i><u> </u>representation of how Web3 will work.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHhAEkG1y2U"></oembed></figure><h2>Evolution of the Web &#8211; Web1, Web2 and Web3</h2><p>As Web2 evolved people depended more on the connectivity that has developed. As such, our data is collected and sold by large corporations that people rely on daily. To use an app or log into a website, you will often have to agree to some data tracking or privacy agreement. These disclaimers are to inform the user of data that a specific function will collect or track.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yet, rarely, does anybody read the statement of legal jargon. Most of us just accept it and continue to download an app or create an account. Check out the following quote. This sums up the negligence in reading privacy&nbsp; statements based on a study by Pro Privacy:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;To prove just how few people bother to read the small print when they purchase an item or engage a service,&nbsp; website <u>ProPrivacy.com succeeded in persuading </u>99 percent of survey respondents to surrender ridiculous things like the naming rights of their first-born child and browsing history access to their mothers&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>This was through a fun social experiment, albeit with a serious intent, designed to show companies can include just about anything and the typical consumer is very likely to accept them, simply because they do not bother to read, or skim-read, or perhaps fail to understand just what is contained within the small print&hellip;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><u>ProPrivacy.com </u>found that getting away with popping ridiculous things into terms and conditions was very easy. The group found that only 1 percent of technology users in a social experiment actually read the terms and conditions.&rdquo; &#8211; Dr. Tim Sandle, DigitalJournal.com</i></p></blockquote><p>It is no wonder that people are in shock after realizing how their data has been used even though we do volunteer this information. Transparency has never been clear as to how our data is collected and used. This is the main catalyst that mobilized people to oppose products that abuse the usage of people&rsquo;s data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When using Web3 the agreements we&rsquo;re used to reading will be replaced with the signing of smart contracts. Though Web3 is still being built and is not yet ready for deployment, it already has use-cases, apps, and websites that anyone can start using today.&nbsp;</p><p>Web3 apps (or dapps &#8211; short for decentralized applications) do not control the content that the user puts on the web. The user controls who is allowed to see, copy/keep, or use any of that data for themselves. The means of control will all be organized by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>.</p><p>So what do we actually gain and/or lose by moving on to Web3? Moreover, what makes it different from Web2?</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/77189/187417/screenshot-95.jpg" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: <u>https://www.researchgate.net/</u></figcaption></figure><p>Web2 gave us the ability to retrieve data as well as send data over the web, one of the first applications being email. Naturally, by technological advancements society later widely adopted social media. Many such advancements have been made from&nbsp; Web2. Today, people are instantly connected to the world with the touch of a hand. This connectivity allowed for much innovation and people now starting to realize the safety and privacy we sacrificed for such convenience.</p><blockquote><p><i>&nbsp;&ldquo;Web 2.0 refers to websites and applications that utilize user-generated content for end-users. Web 2.0 is&nbsp; used in many websites today, chiefly focusing on user interactivity and collaboration. Web 2.0 also focused&nbsp; on providing more universal network connectivity and communication channels. The difference between Web&nbsp; 2.0 and 3.0 is that Web 3.0 is more focused on the use of technologies like machine learning and AI to&nbsp;provide relevant content for each user instead of just the content other end users have provided. Web 2.0&nbsp; essentially allows users to contribute and sometimes collaborate on-site content, while Web 3.0 will most&nbsp; likely turn these jobs over to the semantic web and AI technologies,&rdquo; written Alexander S. Gilis of </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/"><i>TechTarget</i></a><i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>Web1 was the first version of the web accessible to people and in a sense was a mixture of Web2 and Web3. Except Web1 had no large companies to use people&rsquo;s data, being that there wasn&#8217;t much data to use.&nbsp;Web1 did not have the ability for users to interact with each other. As such, the web started as a read-only style interface.&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Cases of Web3</h2><p>Even though web3 is still a work in progress, there are a few notable mentions to organizations that are introducing us to Web3. Building dapps will be different for development on the back end but, will look or act similar to what Web2 does now. There are web browsers growing in popularity that are already Web3 ready.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/brave"><strong>Brave browser</strong></a> is built on the same open-source code as <strong>Google Chrome</strong>. In fact, you can even import your bookmarks, passwords, etc., straight over from your Chrome desktop app to Brave, as well as use <strong>Chrome Store </strong>to install your favorite plugins.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/"><strong>Unstoppable Domains</strong></a><u> </u>is another early platform in the adaption of Web3. If you wanted to have a website domain hosted on Web2, you would register the domain name with a DNS (Domain Name System). Also,&nbsp;unless you know how to code/develop you&rsquo;d probably be paying a monthly fee for a hosting service.&nbsp; Unstoppable Domains charges a one-time fee for a handful of extensions, like .crypto, .coin, .wallet, and others.</p><p>The domain can be registered seamlessly with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://ipfs.io/"><strong>InterPlanetary File System</strong> (<strong>IPFS)</strong></a> and you can &lsquo;mint&rsquo; your domain with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>, or use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/matic-polygon/">Polygon (MATIC)</a> protocol to avoid paying gas fees. The system is still in its infancy so the variety of uses is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, there are many plug-ins and applications for the domains found on their site. The domain itself acts as your online wallet and allows you to use thousands of compatible coins.</p><p>Unstoppable Domains also offer a universal login. The &lsquo;Web3 Identity&rsquo; and &lsquo;Universal Login&rsquo; concepts are very similar. The only difference is that the domain that you chose and minted (a simple name) would be used across&nbsp; Web3. This feature makes Web3 more user-friendly as normally your online wallet address is just a long alphanumeric hash.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, IPFS or Interplanetary File System provides a platform for building on Web3. They are an open-source,&nbsp; decentralized data storage system organization. IPFS makes it possible to store large amounts of data while developing dapps for Web3. The process entails creating CIDs or content Identifiers or &lsquo;hashes&rsquo;. Those CIDs are used to locate data that is filed on various servers in the IPFS network, similar to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">Blockchain&nbsp;technology</a> itself.</p><p>Check out the video below<u> </u>for a detailed explanation of the origin and mechanics of IPFS.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29k2C1JXyg4"></oembed></figure><h2>Criticisms of Web3</h2><p>There are many critics of Web3. People worry about how the regulation of Web3 will work. They also worry about the consequences of nefarious activities or other hurtful content. The before-listed issues&nbsp;would be an issue of regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>The image below shows the disadvantages of Blockchain technology.&nbsp;Though Blockchain and Web3 aren&rsquo;t exactly the same, you couldn&rsquo;t have Web3 without Blockchain. A&nbsp; square is a rectangle, but a rectangle may not be a square scenario if you will.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/77189/187479/untitled-2.jpg" data-srcset=""><figcaption><i>Blockchain Disadvantages.

Another popular argument against Web3 is &#8220;who is building the technology?&#8221; Having the goal of Web3 be decentralization, the companies that build it would need must be decentralized themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Web3 certainly will solve issues in society that are calling for solutions, quickly. As the crypto revolution gains pace, it is not unfeasible that Web3 would be its latest bi-product. There are many valid criticisms of Web3 that question its adaptability. However, as Web3 is still in the works and crypto regulatory issues remain to be resolved, anything can happen. In conclusion, Web3 is definitely something to read into, as it may someday become the new web.&nbsp;</p><p>Below you&rsquo;ll find a shortlist of notable Web3 organizations that could be found with a quick search. Many of these organizations&rsquo; websites will reveal partnerships/collaborations with one another. This shows the determination of this movement as well as the strength of the community.

Over the years, Compound has become one of the most eminent DeFi protocols and remains a massive service with billions worth of funds locked in it.</p><p><strong>Compound Versus Traditional Banks</strong></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/65796/54135/compoundfinance.png" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: Compound.finance</figcaption></figure><p>You may be asking: why do people lock up their funds in DeFi protocols like Compound when we have traditional banks? Isn&rsquo;t it way riskier since it&rsquo;s run on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>? You can&rsquo;t even call a support desk in case something goes awry!</p><p>In some ways, DeFi is indeed riskier, since the protocols are new and there is no middleman to reverse transactions in case of a mistake. With this risk in mind, the rewards are far greater than traditional centralized banking structures. If you&rsquo;re well versed in DeFi and security, these permissionless protocols can become far more lucrative than any offer in the world of traditional finance.</p><p>The main criticism of traditional banks is that their interest rates have been too low for far too long. A common rate you would get today is 0.05% (based on your jurisdiction) if you lock it up in a savings account. You would be lucky, you could probably hunt for a bank that offers interest rates as high as 2%.&nbsp;</p><p>In DeFi, an interest rate of 6% or more is quite common because of the current mechanics of crypto. Although 6% seems high when compared to traditional finance, crypto&rsquo;s valuation has seen massive spikes, so locking up your funds in a protocol would be well worth it if the price of cryptocurrencies&rsquo; continues going up.</p><p>Another benefit of protocols like Compound is that there are no mandatory Know-Your-Customer (KYC) loops that you have to hop through to make an account, You don&#8217;t have to risk revealing your identity by giving your passport or income, which makes it more convenient and secure for a person to use.</p><p>Add this to the fact that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf">31% of the world is unbanked</a> (2017 data), making decentralized finance a way for those who haven&rsquo;t had what should be a fundamental right &#8211; a chance to have free access to global money markets. Having an account where you can pull money from should be the bare minimum for most people. Decentralized finance and protocols like Compound fix</p><p><strong>How To Use Compound</strong></p><p>Compound&rsquo;s simplicity makes it a prime candidate for those who want to make money from their crypto holdings. With its user-friendly interface, the whole protocol is very plug-and-play-like. For those who have never used decentralized finance applications, Compound is a great way to get started. And although it&rsquo;s a good jumping-on point for beginners, it also is a secure place for experienced professionals and has been subject to extensive security audits.</p><p>Knowing your way around Compound also gives you the foundation to the basics of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm">Yield Farming</a> and other techniques that crypto users use in order to reap some gaudy rewards.</p><p>With all that said, let&rsquo;s get started and learn how to use Compound.</p><p><strong>How to Use Compound? Start with A Crypto Wallet</strong></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G775AZhMJLRfWiTPgKMEtNDkdPR3FrGC_J7YLPe4pSMJe2X4RVMdr2zSiPy8-iOg48GI36oGseDJxJ9jX9mQGLDsZ-6hlrNjXHakqMXduKphGZ23iBLo5OtCaaKwln_3gNUYbMPS" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Although not necessarily the best or most secure wallet, the most convenient go-to app for decentralized applications is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/metamask-guide-how-to-set-up-metamask-wallet.htm"><u>Metamask</u></a>.</p><p>Ethereum is the most popular crypto on Metamask, but there are other cryptocurrencies that can be slotted in and used with Compound.</p><p>First, you need to have funds in your wallet to get started, which may differ depending on the wallet you&rsquo;re using. We have a guide on how to<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-deposit-and-withdraw-tokens-through-metamask.htm"><u> deposit funds on Metamask</u></a>, which should be a good primer for how to do so on other wallets compatible with Compound.</p><p>If you already posses a funded wallet, head over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://compound.finance/"><u>compound.finance</u></a>. From here, you can click the top right corner to enter the application in order to begin using the app.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yVk2aWzow9RdDjsIYtp3TjikYrNf8u-untWJbd0YRw5373kFdhRSJRsk5fnkWxpQN-hQb9cfSSRI2PU8LYng0xfM1arJI-_vg92JwL03_fCCrTMJiEXNYUfPNQTKGEJj6sa3ZOkj" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Once you&rsquo;re in, it will show a list of wallets that are compatible with Compound. You can select the wallet of your preference and proceed to the dashboard.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8nS5rXEzJEODEqDpje7nYwoVRdEXsE-8K8TOzxnzp3LQnCAY-iCjL0ZExGEWV4KDI1eAB2j71WgJI9XLBnhdMdRV0FEHJ10jNIOkqCY5Vp5CXYzFAzJh-RsJHovrD95J5AeoCncl" data-srcset=""></figure><p><strong>Compound Dashboard</strong></p><p>After connecting, you&rsquo;ll be led to the <i>Dashboard</i> where you will see a list of cryptocurrencies supported by Compound. Here, you can learn the basics of earning APY in crypto and gain valuable DeFi experience. This is one of the applications where you can go from beginner to a veteran, from dipping your toes into the space to strategizing crypto investments for the best returns possible.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Vfr-yn6hLiTc9P1jVkL-_NngFnINxpwsvzRW1Hgfm8W21TzF8SWCHS-1dWkBZFBtRFMmjOK25Xiix8LH4mtoduisYCNk86xoO1uO7HGUHbvexlrcLst0ZWc0UWvnr44ucPBLHtFC" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Here, you can see the supply and borrow balance of your account, which will change when you&rsquo;ve deposited funds, as well as the different APY of the tokens. There is also a collateral tab you can use once you&rsquo;ve deposited tokens to use as collateral to earn APY or to borrow other tokens from the Compound protocol.</p><p>If you have any funds in your wallet, the amount should show up on the dashboard. Click on it to see what you can use that deposited crypto for.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bvUwzqD5VSGiy-RsI3W-pf2zgLd_oLPapYhZeeH8SkzRCQUg-SMBKCiMAA4s0sPyahgouZ_9R-u_oO7l-UWB4MrE1bQjliyI5ABWu3QyrYmKTymOm5uypetIM7mJZRkKzpYo-dKt" data-srcset=""></figure><p>At the top, you can input how much <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">ether</a> you want to supply to Compound. The APY for supplying the network through Compound will be shown to you. If there is a borrowing limit, that will be given as well. Once you have typed in the amount you want to supply at the top, click the supply button.</p><p>You will then be prompted to confirm the transaction and the amount of crypto for transaction fees that you need to pay. Be careful, as some networks have become congested with high trading volume and user activity. Ethereum has become notorious for high gas fees, so sometimes it is best to wait for lower rates at different time. Keep that in mind when confirming transactions on Compound.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8DSBZHvSOpeE_Utb0pJwYdN2jr1IUBYIhNholsLLMWqiCjbw5WdBJ8oObqzJBqV2TD4H_7tG1K0lY3Uuh63TCM4ygyEraTNaDxMsguvgkGOG1zu0IH6cRsnQw0HoQj_Moj6rBIgi" data-srcset=""></figure><p>After confirmation, you will be shown the crypto you chose to supply and its value in dollars.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ju5dkR5WaLz27Dq0jHfMXVFB2AF3NPstQi6SbZH7sJukDpACV8r6skRCukN-ge6v-PH9KihThRHD0D5sqZhaUrn7Yv5afaEuOtCASd-hLdFBeWIsa7PEsYVm15-ocNNK3KCczi5D" data-srcset=""></figure><p>The number will continuously change under the supply balance, showing in real-time the amount of crypto you&rsquo;re earning.</p><p>Congrats! You are now earning crypto through Compound and taking advantage of their interest rates and yield.</p><p><strong>Borrowing</strong></p><p>In case that you need to borrow other cryptos for a promising trade, Compound allows you to do so with the funds that you have supplied. You can use any token that you&rsquo;ve supplied to borrow other tokens. You can just stick to supplying tokens and earning yield if you&rsquo;re a beginner. But once you&rsquo;ve learned the ins and outs of crypto, there may be trades that tempt you to borrow loans to make a good profit.</p><p>What you need to realize, though, is that Compound works with <i>over-collateralization</i>, which means you have to use more funds as collateral than you take out. At first, this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. Why would you put more money than you take out?</p><p>However, the crypto world moves fast. The asset you borrow for a trade maybe just in time for very lucrative trade and you can get way more for the value that you initially put in. Also, over-collateralization protects the network. For example, you could be liquidated if the crypto price drops too low.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/H72p_xRXmq7av5altwKscCJ_HBzCCwzxHCxWmAGJWUNfllfghNIE94EecL6b4wpoACOHZi3OP35Cui8EzPp9beuDRsMYTVvKylOh9ZiKPLkDeX9m2jlc1fow_aP7UyG96ldhCZmf" data-srcset=""></figure><p>To borrow funds, first, you need to deposit them, which you would have already done with the instructions above.</p><p>As shown in the graphic, you should click the collateral button so that Compound is aware that you will use it as collateral.</p><p>After this, you can begin to borrow tokens from Compound.</p><p>Click on which token you are looking to borrow with your deposited crypto. In this case, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/basic-attention-token/">Basic Attention Token</a> was chosen.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/neMJrPaaJJP8mj2WbjIXyLOC8XxXwb7c4HGQOevc8so5-X7_Lc71_n4pZtdDaHfZSx3KzmiewrG2ZI2lMdYoZxRRRTgBk19JGJphPnUp6bcHqql78cunH9LL4SC8jmS6W5qJLcRQ" data-srcset=""></figure><p>At the top, you can put in how much of the crypto that you want to borrow, which will have an 80% limit.</p><p>To repay what you&rsquo;ve loaned, simply click on the same crypto and hit the repay button.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o0Sr6i9YMsLcrL14SsOck6y6IwgtBkZSqvRDzkypZ9WtWk0jm1m4K3emhV8bBrhj1-19KxDjEOk3kV7ks_CoKiY_MVmX8RXK5KaG_2yyn2vu8s5A3I1ybdMObVs_ei594egfwGeI" data-srcset=""></figure><p>If you have the token funds, your loan will be repaid. Hopefully, by this time, you would have made a good trade with your borrowed loan so that the transactions were worth it.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Although armed with enough tools for beginners of DeFi, Compound is used by a wide variety of professionals in order to make full use of the crypto space. With the rise of crypto in 2021, the protocol seems to have a bright future ahead. Sooner or later, we may see the everyday person lock funds into Compound because of how much better the yield is in comparison to traditional banking structures. Time will tell, but the more people become educated in the DeFi space, the more successful applications like Compound will be.</p>

Numerous ambitious lending protocols like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/aave-new/">Aave</a> (AAVE) have sparked a hope that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm">DeFi</a> might eventually have the same omnipresence as traditional finance, and this would be a godsend to the millions of unbanked all around the world.</p><p>DeFi allows millions of average citizens to gain access to crypto wallets, which function as personal bank accounts, and grant permissionless access to all basic and not-so-basic programmable financial tools. In a near future, anyone should be able to put their assets to use in a financial application, like loans and interest yields. Aave bridges such vision closer to reality.</p><h3><strong>Brief History Of Aave</strong></h3><p>Before it was named Aave, the protocol went by the name of ETHLend. Envisioned by developer Stanley Kulechov, ETHlend intended to connect lenders and borrowers with loan requests that matched up. When ETHlend needed reimagining in order to stay afloat, it was rebranded as Aave in 2020, using liquidity pools and algorithmic determination of interest rates, giving birth to what would become the giant of DeFi today.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/62829/45879/untitled.png" data-srcset=""><figcaption>Source: Aave.com</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Aave&rsquo;s Rise</strong></h3><p>Aave has risen among cryptocurrency enthusiasts as a promising application for the next generation of DeFi. In addition to lending, staking, and yield, protocols that are included in regular DeFi applications, Aave caught the crypto world&rsquo;s attention with the introduction of flash loans, which are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contract</a> loans which you can get with no collateral that you have to pay back within a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>On the surface, one would wonder how you can get a loan for nothing and what the point of it is in paying the loan back in such a strict time frame. With DeFi being run by smart contracts instead of centralized entities, a whole world of possibilities opens up. Those few seconds could mean everything when attempting to You&rsquo;ll be able to execute strategies that traditional finance wouldn&rsquo;t normally consider, thus making things like flash loans have usefulness that traditional finance wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pull out.</p><h3><strong>Aave&#8217;s Notable Features</strong></h3><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/aave-new/"><strong>AAVE Token</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Like the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/comp-compoundd/">Compound</a> protocol, Aave has its own token. The AAVE token, which is a 1:1 ratio taken from the Aave liquidity pool, generates yield when you make enough of a deposit on a derivative token.</li><li><strong>Switching Rates.</strong> Most DeFi protocols only have variable rates because of the volatility of the crypto market. The valuation of most coins are continuously oscillating and these qualities are also reflected when making loans. With Aave, you can choose to fix the interest rate, rather than keep a varying one, which adds a whole other dimension to lending.</li><li><strong>Flash Loans. </strong>Flash loans are what brought Aave attention in the crypto world. This is what distinguishes the platform from other DeFi protocols. Here, you can use smart contracts in order to execute a loan, which you have to pay back in seconds. If you&rsquo;re operating with market mechanics that happen at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</li></ul><p>Learn more about flash loans here:&nbsp;</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=186zm5HDf7c"></oembed></figure><h3><strong>Connecting An Online Wallet</strong></h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uxMBOfSXQXfAyECn8Pz5PpZTKlrA1tAcgBCgUYNOOCpzxTI54KQlGnAQp2sM49xAUU7sv4S2IxswzcjrkJTJAm6d6MN4POZ9vhsntG1Gh1ZjWtFMRFsJHOkCmrXSFw-ahLoUkVGw" data-srcset=""></figure><p>Before getting started, you&rsquo;ll need to connect a wallet to Aave in order to use any of its features.

In the borrow page, you will find a list of tokens that you can borrow, how much you will be able to borrow and the variable and stable APY. If you click on one of the coins, you will be directed to the next page with information about your chosen token.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ut5D7J9JpfTuzhGBXLSivb9eLNaVFmBoZ-L3S0UrUX9cWNGmpV0Kju7Pb0KDnJv2bGCBzkphSiNKQ3bAiomdU-axdk2DRpkFdN4AqFpe2GTjb01mHRlWzB1SkC2qnzQROkZc2e_M" data-srcset=""></figure><p>The utilization rate tells you the amount that the chosen asset is being borrowed compared to the sum that is available for borrowing. The higher the number is, the more the asset is being borrowed and the higher the interest rate the borrower has to pay. The available liquidity is how much you are able to borrow, and the asset price is the current market price of your chosen token.</p><p>The option for stable or variable rates is a feature that Aave became known for. At the cost of paying more for your borrowed asset, you can stabilize the APY, making the loan rate predictable, at a much higher interest rate cost. If you believe that market circumstances will change, this is a handy option to have. Otherwise, you can use a variable APY much like most other decentralized finance applications if you think stabilization will be costlier.</p><p>After this, you can visit your dashboard and see how your assets are doing.</p><h3><strong>Swaps on Aave</strong></h3><p>Much like decentralized exchanges, Aave allows swaps in a limited capacity. You can select the asset that you want to swap, the rate the swap will cost, the slippage (which is the change in price that you will allow and the swap will still execute), and finally approve the transaction.</p><p>Make sure to have enough of the intended token to execute your swap.</p><h3><strong>Executing Flash Loans</strong></h3><p>As of right now, flash loans require extensive smart contract programming, so are inaccessible to the average DeFi user. Maybe a day will come when flash loans can be done at a click of a button without the need for a user to run it on lines of code. Before, creating NFTs could only be done through someone who knew how to develop on <strong>Solidity</strong>. Now anyone can take a picture of a toilet, create an NFT with it, and attempt to auction it on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-mint-and-create-an-nft.htm">OpenSea</a>.</p><p>If you know how to code and are raring to make eye-popping DeFi profits, numerous tutorials online have already sprung up for you to take advantage of DeFi&rsquo;s lucrative potential. Otherwise, you might have to learn an entire profession and skills like programming to access smart contracts until they are more accessible to the average person.</p><p>Even with how difficult they are to access, flash loans have still been the talk of the town in DeFi. When lucrative trends and trades can be seen and made in the blink of an eye, exchanging assets without collateral at lightning speed is a valuable tool for traders who have already sunk their teeth deep into decentralized finance.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Although it had just been rebranded in 2020, Aave has already made a name for itself with its impressive array of features. With over USD 20 billion worth of assets in Aave at the time of writing, Aave circulates a hefty amount in the DeFi space. As it continues to climb the ranks in DeFi protocols and cement its usefulness in the crypto space, we could potentially be talking about Aave in the future as one of the most innovative decentralized finance protocols of the current dApp landscape.</p>

If not, click <strong>&lsquo;No Thanks&rsquo;.</strong></p><p>Next, it will take you to password creation. For security reasons, you should create a completely original password made with a combination of letters, numbers and symbols.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="metamask password" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/82448a1606.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/82448a1606.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/82448a1606.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/82448a1606.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/82448a1606.png 900w"></figure><p>Create your password, agree to the Terms of Use, and hit Create.

In this way, you can restore your account if you ever delete MetaMask from your browser. You can also access your account on a new computer from anywhere with a seed phrase. You&rsquo;ll be asked to confirm your secret phrase in the correct order on the next page.</p><p>Keep this seed phrase on a piece of paper and secure it in a completely private location. MetaMask suggests storing it in a bank vault, in a safe, as well as other multiple secret places.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="metamask guide" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/8283039483.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/8283039483.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/8283039483.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/8283039483.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/8283039483.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/608/8283039483.png 474w"></figure><p>Awesome! Now that you&rsquo;ve created your MetaMask, all you have to do next is transfer Ethereum tokens, which we&rsquo;ll cover in another article. After filling up your wallet, you can dive deep into the decentralized ecosystem, like buying and selling NFT art or going for big gains in decentralized finance. MetaMask connects to applications fast, so you should be diving into the decentralized world in no time!</p><p>If you want to learn about setting up MetaMask on mobile and even sync your browser extension to the mobile app, read on.</p><h2>Setting up MetaMask on Mobile</h2><p>As more and more decentralized applications are on mobile, learning how to set one up will give you access to dapps on the go. The mobile app also goes the extra distance in making you familiar with the application.</p><p>Simply search MetaMask in your phone&rsquo;s store and install to begin. <strong>IMPORTANT: Be wary of imposter apps and only choose the one with most downloads and developed by the original, credible developers or risk losing your funds.</strong></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="metamask mobile app" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/828a727a5b.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/828a727a5b.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/828a727a5b.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/828a727a5b.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/828a727a5b.png 900w"></figure><p>After clicking Install, you&rsquo;ll be welcomed by MetaMask.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="metamask mobile guide" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/828c1a11e6.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/828c1a11e6.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/828c1a11e6.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/828c1a11e6.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/828c1a11e6.jpg 900w"></figure><p>Press Get started to start setting up your wallet. After this point, certain phone screenshots are not allowed by MetaMask for security reasons. If you need photos for reference, it&rsquo;s fairly similar to the desktop version above, so you can scroll up.</p><p>In the next step, you can choose to sync your MetaMask to your desktop extension. You&rsquo;ll have to open the extension on desktop, proceed to Settings &gt; Advanced, &lsquo;Sync with Mobile,&rsquo; and scan your QR code. After this, your desktop extension will be connected to your MetaMask.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to have your own mobile MetaMask wallet, click Create a new wallet.</p><p>Like the desktop version, it will ask you to create a new password and confirm that password. Read and agree to the Terms and Conditions.</p><p>Next, you&rsquo;ll create your 12-word seed phrase. You&rsquo;ll be prompted to confirm that seed phrase by clicking the words in the correct order. Like the desktop version, store your seed phrase safely. The app will also ask if you want to share your usage data. Again, choose whichever option you feel comfortable with.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="help to improve metamask" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/828e516f9b.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/828e516f9b.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/828e516f9b.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/828e516f9b.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/828e516f9b.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/608/828e516f9b.png 832w"></figure><p>After that, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to take a tour of the mobile app. It will mention that you can create multiple accounts on your MetaMask by just tapping on the mobile icon. MetaMask will then suggest that you create an account name, mentioning that the name should be memorable and distinct, like CryptoCuddles for example.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="metamask cryptocuddles" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/829080e47d.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/829080e47d.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/829080e47d.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/829080e47d.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/829080e47d.png 900w"></figure><p>After creating your account name, the app will lead you to where you can find your Wallet options, Transaction History, link to share your Public Address, and so forth.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="MetaMask example" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/82929a18d3.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/82929a18d3.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/82929a18d3.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/82929a18d3.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/82929a18d3.png 900w"></figure><p>Then, MetaMask will relay you to the search page. The app is neatly laid out. It gives organized suggestions for ways you can use your MetaMask application.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="metamask defi" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/82943b20bb.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/608/82943b20bb.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/608/82943b20bb.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/608/82943b20bb.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/608/82943b20bb.png 900w"></figure><p>After transferring Ethereum to your account, which we&rsquo;ll cover in another article, you can come back to these applications and try them out.
