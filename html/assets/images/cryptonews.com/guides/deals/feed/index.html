										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/guide/65903/44414/changenowrszd.jpeg"></figure><p>Crypto trading platform <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://changenow.io/?link_id=f5d6e2f3b34439"><strong>ChangeNOW</strong></a> has decided to treat Cryptonews.com readers with a special promotion just in time for the holiday season: with a special discount code, valid from now through the end of this year. You will be able to use the platform with a discount worth 0.2% until December 31st, 2021&mdash;just in time to get a head start on your New Year&rsquo;s resolutions (of trading more crypto, most likely).&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Choose ChangeNOW&nbsp;</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re on the lookout for a new instant exchange boasting a great number of altcoins, ChangeNOW is the place to be. With over 300 altcoins and 60 fiat currencies, chances are, you&rsquo;ll find what it is you&rsquo;re looking for&mdash;and more. The platform is custody-free, which means your tokens are never at a risk, as long as you take the usual, reasonable precautions. Transactions are instant, or near enough; even in the most extreme cases, it won&rsquo;t take you longer than two minutes, beginning to end, to finalize one.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it&rsquo;s not just crypto trading that ChangeNOW offers. As a very broad ecosystem, it encompasses more or less everything you might need in the crypto space: a secure wallet, mobile exchange apps, crypto loans, payments, price trackers, and a whole host of other, ever-growing services. With an ultimate goal of becoming a one-stop shop for all things crypto, ChangeNOW is an excellent choice for those users who prefer a simple, streamlined experience to separating everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps one of their biggest selling points is how privacy-centric they are. You don&rsquo;t even have to sign up if you don&rsquo;t want to. On the other hand, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you shouldn&rsquo;t: the platform treats their loyal customers very well, with perks for those who do sign up, including crypto loans and a cashback program.&nbsp;</p><h3>So What&rsquo;s the Promo Code?&nbsp;</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase: the special promo code for ChangeNOW is <strong>AF7643FCE7DC </strong>and is already activated, meaning that all you have to do is follow our tracking link <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://changenow.io/?link_id=f5d6e2f3b34439">here</a>. However, in case you run into issues following the link (or you simply want to take matters into your own hands) you can activate it by opening the Advanced Settings page on the exchange and copy-pasting this code into the space for codes.&nbsp;</p><p>Their Advanced Settings tab will also show you how much you&rsquo;re getting from each transaction with this code applied; this means that if you can&rsquo;t exactly calculate the discount yourself&mdash;or don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;the platform will do it for you.&nbsp;</p><p>And that&rsquo;s all there is to it! Happy trading and remember, never invest more than you&rsquo;re willing to lose!</p>

While it&rsquo;s not easy to find company information on 1xBit online, 1xBet is a Russian company in Limassol, Cyprus. 1xBet was established in 2007 and first licensed in an exotic Carribean island of Curacao.</p><p>1xBit has launched in 2016 and has become a major player in the bitcoin gambling scene. As of today, the website has more than 200,000 active users.</p><h3>1xBit fees</h3><p>Unlike cryptocurrency markets and exchanges, where you have to pay maker or taker fees for every move you make, crypto casinos and betting sites like 1xBit does not charge you any extra fees.</p><p>Besides, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees, too. All you have to cover are blockchain transaction fees which you have to pay whenever you transfer your funds.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="1xbit live casino review" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/d64e42419b.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/d64e42419b.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cf/d64e42419b.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cf/d64e42419b.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cf/d64e42419b.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cf/d64e42419b.jpg 1895w"></figure><h3>1xBit safety and security</h3><p>Security is at the core of 1xBit operations, so all user transactions use an advanced SSL end-to-end encryption. Your privacy and anonymity are taken seriously, too, as you don&rsquo;t need to verify your identity nor provide any extra data unless there is a suspicion that your account may have been misused.</p><p>Despite basing its activities around cryptocurrencies, 1xBit does not disclose what security measures are taken to protect your crypto deposits. All it says is that players information and funds are encrypted and protected. To date, 1xBit has no record of any hacks. On the user side of things, you can protect your account with a strong password and two-factor authentication (2FA) from Google.</p><p>Fairness is of paramount importance for online gambling sites. With that, all 1xBit&rsquo;s slots are vetted by independent companies and are completely randomly generated.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="1xbit bitcoin casino review" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/d651676d0c.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/d651676d0c.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cf/d651676d0c.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cf/d651676d0c.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cf/d651676d0c.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cf/d651676d0c.jpg 1894w"></figure><h3>1xBit user experience</h3><p>User experience is a mixed bag at 1xBIt. At first, you will be delighted to go through the frictionless registration process and discover the unparalleled selection of games and activities on 1xBit. You can bet on thousands of sports events including esports, play hundreds of games at the casino and live casino, participate in lottery games, and even financial markets.</p><p>However, the user interface of the website feels somewhat cramped. There are many details and distractions everywhere, so the website can be confusing and difficult to navigate until you get used to it.</p><p>Nonetheless, the separate sections like betting books or games are rather easy to use. Furthermore, you can access the website from your mobile device, whether you use Android and iOS, and use the service in one of the 52 offered languages.</p><p>Besides, 1xBit&rsquo;s customer service is available around the clock and includes live chat support and email support.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="1xbit review forex" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/d67ffcfb0c.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5cf/d67ffcfb0c.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5cf/d67ffcfb0c.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5cf/d67ffcfb0c.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5cf/d67ffcfb0c.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5cf/d67ffcfb0c.jpg 1905w"></figure><h3>1xBit deposit and withdrawal methods</h3><p>Both deposits and withdrawals are done in cryptocurrencies only. The processes don&rsquo;t require you to pass any KYC forms, so your information always remains private and secure.</p><p>Deposits at 1xBit are rather fast and straightforward since all you need to do is transfer funds into the site&rsquo;s crypto wallet. Currently, it accepts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/litecoin/">Litecoin</a> (LTC), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a> (DOGE), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dash/">DASH</a> (DASH), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/monero/">Monero</a> (XMR), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/zcash/">ZCas</a>h (ZEC), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/gamecredits/">GameCredits</a> (GAME), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/nem/">NEM</a> (NEM), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bytecoin-bcn/">Bytecoin</a> (BCN), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/digibyte/">DigiByte</a> (DGB), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-gold/">Bitcoin Gold</a> (BTG), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash</a> (BCH), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic</a> (ETC), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitshares/">BitShares</a> (BTS), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/verge/">Verge</a> (XVG), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/qtum/">Qtum</a> (QTUM), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/stratis/">Stratis</a> (STRAT), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">Ripple</a> (XRP), and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tron/">Tron</a> (TRX) cryptocurrencies.
