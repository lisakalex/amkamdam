Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a crypto platform out there for nearly any trading and investing style.</p><p>In this guide, we&rsquo;ll compare the best crypto exchanges, detailing the pros, cons, and standout features of each so you can choose which one fits your needs. Ultimately, you might even choose multiple platforms, using different platforms for specific trades or investments.</p><h2>Our Top Picks: The Best Crypto Exchanges</h2><p>There are hundreds of cryptocurrency platforms available today, ranging from platforms for basic crypto purchases to full-featured exchanges. Collectively, we&rsquo;ve used many of them, making real-world trades and clicking buttons to see how each one really works. Here are our top picks for the best crypto exchanges.</p><ol>

</ol><h2>The Top Crypto Exchanges Reviewed</h2><p>We compared the best crypto exchanges, including features, pros and cons, and trading fees.</p><h3>1. eToro &#8211; Crypto and Stock Trading Platform With Innovative Copy Trading Tools and $100k Demo Account</h3><p>Started in 2007 as a trading platform focused on transparency and ease of use, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> initially offered forex trading, letting users trade currencies easily. Over time, the platform added stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and then added cryptocurrency trading in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>What started as a Bitcoin-only offering has grown to over 80 cryptocurrencies available for trading, including popular choices like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIBxM).&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro's crypto selection" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334257/etoro-overview.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>eToro&rsquo;s approach to trading makes it one of the best crypto exchanges for beginners, although experienced traders will also feel at home due in part to eToro&#8217;s advanced TradingView charts with up to 100 market indicators. On both mobile and desktop, the interface is bright, inviting, and easy to navigate. A simple search box at the top of the screen helps you discover new assets to trade, news stories, and posts from other traders, which leads to one of eToro&rsquo;s strongest selling points: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/etoro/"><u>eToro Social Trading</u></a>.</p><p>You can follow posts from other investors (or share your own thoughts), but eToro also lets you copy the trades of other traders using their intuitively named Copy Trading. In the US, copy trading is currently limited to crypto trades (and cryptos supported in the US). Elsewhere in the world, you can copy trades for crypto, stocks, ETFs, and even commodities. Just find a trader that interests you, and check their trading history &mdash; including long-term performance, risk level, and percentage of profitable weeks &mdash; and then click &ldquo;copy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You choose the investment amount for each copy trade, and you can also set a &ldquo;stop loss&rdquo; by choosing a level to exit the trade if the market turns south.</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro copytrading" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334258/etoro-copy-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>eToro also offers a demo account called a Virtual Portfolio. Every account gets $100,000 in virtual funds with which to test trading strategies or just learn the ropes of trading crypto on eToro. It&rsquo;s a risk-free way to learn, and very few competing exchanges offer the feature.</p><h4>eToro Trading Fees</h4><p>eToro uses a flat 1% trading fee for cryptocurrencies. Here&rsquo;s how it works.&nbsp;</p><p>For a $100 BTC purchase, you&rsquo;ll pay $1 in trading fees. You&rsquo;ll also pay 1% when you sell, which may be higher or lower than $1 based on the value when you close the position. For standard orders, you&rsquo;ll buy at the ask price (and sell at the bid price), so you also pay a spread. We&rsquo;ll cover bids, asks, and spreads in more detail later in the guide.&nbsp;</p><p>eToro&rsquo;s 1% crypto trading fee is easy to understand and makes trading costs predictable, a welcome approach compared to many popular exchanges. Coinbase, for example, uses two different fee schedules, and both have several levels.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>eToro offers over 80 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Shiba Inu (SHIBxM &#8211; SHIB in millions)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>
<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</li>
</ul><h4>eToro Pros and Cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Newbie-friendly interface</li>
<li>Copy trading: copy the trades of successful investors</li>
<li>Smart portfolios: Choose from ETF-style targeted investments</li>
<li>PayPal support</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul>
<li>Limited support for crypto storage in eToro Money wallet</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t move crypto onto the platform</li>
<li>$5 withdrawal fee</li>

</div><h3>2. Coinbase &#8211; Publicly Traded Crypto Exchange With Over 250 Cryptos, Advanced Trading, and Staking</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en">Coinbase</a> dates back to 2012 and the exchange is currently the largest publicly traded exchange worldwide. Being a publicly traded company brings more transparency for users because Coinbase discloses its <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx"><u>SEC statements</u></a> and <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><u>financial statements</u></a> to comply with regulatory requirements. Following the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/rise-fall-crypto-exchange-ftx-2022-11-10/"><u>collapse of FTX</u></a> in 2022, transparency has become more important than ever.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll find over 250 cryptocurrencies available for trading on Coinbase, ranging from top assets like BTC and ETH to newly launched tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>Like eToro, Coinbase is known for its user-friendly interface. However, Coinbase uses two trading platforms&nbsp; &mdash; simple and advanced &mdash; which can add some complexity for newer traders.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="coinbase wallet trade crypto" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334260/coinbase-trading.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>There&rsquo;s also a third trading option called Coinbase One. With a $30 monthly subscription, traders can trade with no additional fees. Coinbase reports that subscribers save an average of $55 per month with Coinbase One.</p><p>Most new traders will gravitate toward Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades, which you can access through conveniently placed Buy &amp; Sell buttons throughout the site. While easy to use, it&rsquo;s worth noting that simple trades come with higher fees, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/"><u>Coinbase&rsquo;s fee structure</u></a> varies based on the amount of the trade as well as the funding source.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="coinbase buy crypto preview" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334261/coinbase-simple-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>One key advantage of using Coinbase or a similar full-featured crypto exchange like Kraken (up next), is that you can move your crypto off the exchange easily. Many traders prefer to keep larger balances in a crypto wallet they control rather than on the exchange. eToro also supports this for Bitcoin and seven other assets, but many crypto assets can&#8217;t be moved off the eToro platform.</p><h4>Coinbase Trading Fees</h4><p>Coinbase offers simple trades, as mentioned above, but also provides an advanced trading platform called Coinbase Advanced. You&rsquo;ll save money by trading on Coinbase Advanced, but expect to invest some time in learning the platform. You&rsquo;ll find a myriad of buttons, toggles, and settings to trade with precision.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the cost difference between simple trades and Coinbase Advanced.</p><p><strong>Trading fees for a $100 Bitcoin purchase:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Simple trades: </strong>$3.84 + 1% spread</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase Advanced (market order):</strong> $0.80 + market spread (buy at ask price)</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase Advanced (limit order):</strong> $0.60 (no spread with limit orders)</li>
</ul><p>Coinbase Advanced offers lower fees compared to eToro. However, eToro brings lower trading costs compared to Coinbase&#8217;s simple trades.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Coinbase offers over 250 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Solana (SOL)</li>
<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
<li>Polygon (MATIC)</li>
</ul><h3>Coinbase Pros and Cons</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Learning rewards for passing quizzes</li>
<li>Easy-to-use simple trades</li>
<li>Reduced fees with advanced trades</li>
<li>Easily move crypto to and from Coinbase</li>

</div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>3. Kraken &#8211; Security-Focused Crypto Exchange With Proof-Of-Reserves, 200+ Cryptos, and Low Fees</h3><p>As one of the oldest crypto exchanges, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/en">Kraken</a> has earned a loyal following through transparency combined with low trading fees. Kraken was founded in 2011, just two years after Bitcoin came onto the scene as the first cryptocurrency. Now, this San Francisco-based exchange offers 200+ cryptocurrencies and provides trading services in nearly 200 countries worldwide. This gives Kraken a wider footprint compared to Coinbase, which operates in just over 100 countries.</p><p>Transparency has always been paramount with Kraken, and the company was the first to provide <a href="https://www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves"><u>proof-of-reserves</u></a>, which is a blockchain-based method of proving that the company has the crypto it shows for your account.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="kraken exchange buy bitcoin" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334265/kraken-simple-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Like Coinbase, Kraken offers both simple trades and advanced trading, with the latter being called Kraken Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the Pro moniker, you can use Kraken&rsquo;s advanced trading platform as a beginner or intermediate trader to enjoy lower fees and access advanced analytics at a glance.&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="kraken trading dashboard" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334266/kraken-pro.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><h4>Kraken Trading Fees</h4><p>Similar to Coinbase, Kraken offers two trading platforms. The simpler of these is called Instant Buy/Sell and brings higher trading costs compared to the advanced platform as well as eToro&rsquo;s 1% fee. Instant Buy/Sell orders use a variable &ldquo;display fee,&rdquo; which you see on your details before you confirm, plus a spread that can vary based on market conditions.</p><p>Like many simple buy boxes, it can be a pricier way to trade crypto. The real trading-cost savings come from Kraken Pro, where you&rsquo;ll pay just 0.26% for market orders and 0.16% for limit orders. This compares well against Coinbase Advanced where you&rsquo;ll pay 0.8% or 0.6%, respectively.</p><p>Watch out for higher fees on debit card transactions, however.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are the fees we saw in sample trades for $100 worth of Bitcoin:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (bank transfer):</strong> $1.97</li>
<li><strong>Instant Buy/Sell (debit card):</strong> $5.42</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (limit order): </strong>$0.16</li>
<li><strong>Kraken Pro (market order): </strong>$0.26</li>
</ul><p>Healthy trading volume combined with low fees help make Kraken one of the best bitcoin exchanges and crypto exchanges overall.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Kraken offers over 200 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Solana (SOL)</li>
<li>Tron (TRX)</li>
<li>Chainlink (LINK)</li>
</ul><h3>Kraken Pros and Cons</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>
<li>Proof of reserves (per account)</li>
<li>Low fees on Kraken Pro</li>
<li>200+ cryptos</li>
<li>Available in 190+ countries</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul>
<li>High trading fees for Instant Buy/Sell trades</li>
<li>High debit card fees</li>
<li>Debit cards not supported for Kraken Pro</li>

</div><h3><br>&nbsp;4. Binance &#8211; Full-Featured Exchange With 350+ Cryptocurrencies, Low Fees, and Trading Bots</h3><p><a href="https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/binance/en">Binance</a> is the largest crypto exchange worldwide by trading volume, but whether you can use the platform depends on where you live in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>US residents aren&rsquo;t able to use the main exchange but can use Binance.US. Currently, Binance.US does not support bank deposits (crypto deposits only), which makes an otherwise easy-to-use exchange less beginner-friendly. Traders from other areas of the world will find Binance.com offers basic trading with plenty of room to grow into advanced trading, including futures, leveraged trades, crypto loans, and much more.</p><p>With over 350 cryptocurrencies available for trading, Binance offers one of the largest crypto selections in our roundup, giving you access to staples like BTC and ETH, as well as many lesser-known cryptocurrencies like RDNT or ARB.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="binance trading chart" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334269/binance-advanced-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>You&rsquo;ll also find more trading on Binance pairs compared to many other exchanges. Above, you&rsquo;ll see the RDNT/BTC trading pair. Many exchanges don&rsquo;t offer smaller cryptocurrencies at all and BTC trading pairs are typically limited to very high-volume assets like UDST or ETH. Binance offers more flexibility in trading, but like many other exchanges, much of the functionality revolves around the advanced trading platform rather than the instant buy boxes you&rsquo;ll see throughout the site.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="buy crypto with binance" width="1576" height="449" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334270/binance-easy.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>To its credit, Binance makes instant buys affordable. You&rsquo;ll pay the base trading fee of 0.1% plus a 0.5% fee for using the instant buy box. This compares well against Kraken, which charges about 2% for instant buys, and Coinbase, which charges 3.84% for a $100 simple trade. Binance instant buys are also more affordable compared to eToro. However, eToro&rsquo;s ease of use combined with innovative features like Copy Trading make it a popular choice.</p><h4>Binance Trading Fees</h4><p>Binance puts less distance between trading fees for its advanced platform vs its simple trading platform. For <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/"><u>Binance Advanced</u></a>, you&rsquo;ll pay 0.1% for both limit and market orders. Using instant buys, the simpler trading interface, adds a 0.5% fee to the trade and reduces the number of cryptocurrencies you can trade to just under 100.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Binance offers over 350 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>FLOKI (FLOKI)</li>
<li>PEPE (PEPE)</li>
<li>Gala (GALA)</li>
<li>dYdX (DYDX)</li>
<li>Sui Network (SUI)</li>

OKX &#8211; Lowest-Cost Exchange With Copy Trading, Trading Bots, and 350+ Cryptocurrencies</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/okx/en">OKK</a> offers many of the advanced features you&rsquo;ll find on Binance but with even lower fees for limit orders. This could make OKX the best Bitcoin exchange if trading fees are your main consideration and you&rsquo;re comfortable using an advanced trading platform. (OKX offers a demo account perfect for learning.)</p><p>You&rsquo;ll pay just 0.08% for limit orders while market orders parallel Binance&rsquo;s trading fees at 0.1%.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, like Binance, OKX has over 350 cryptocurrencies available, including BTC, ETH, and a host of newer tokens to discover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="okx bitcoin trading platform" width="1600" height="799" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334273/okx-advanced.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>One downside, however, is that OKX is not available in the US or Canada. Instead, traders in (northern) North America &mdash; and elsewhere &mdash; can use OKcoin, a sister exchange that serves over 190 countries and offers a simple trading interface.&nbsp;</p><p>Trading fees on OKcoin come in slightly higher at 0.1% for limit orders and 0.2% for market orders, both of which are more affordable than Kraken or Coinbase.</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="OKX buy bitcoin" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334274/okcoin.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>The main exchange at OKX offers trading bots, which are programmable automated traders that buy and sell according to the rules you define. You&rsquo;ll also find perpetual futures trading, a way to bet on the future price of a cryptocurrency without buying it, and a demo account so you can practice your trades or tune up your trading bots before you turn them loose in real-world trades.</p><h3>OKX Pros and Cons</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul>

Nexo &#8211; Easy-To-Use Crypto Platform With 60+ Cryptos, Crypto Lending, and Crypto Loans</h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/nexo/en">Nexo</a> dates back to 2018. Since its launch, the Swiss-based crypto exchange has grown to over 6 million users in over 200 countries worldwide. With 60+ cryptocurrencies available for trading, you&rsquo;ll find the most popular crypto assets, like BTC and ETH, as well as some that can be more difficult to find, like TRON (TRX)&nbsp; and XRP.&nbsp;</p><p>Nexo&rsquo;s features parallel many of those you&rsquo;re familiar with from banks. In many regions (but not in the US), you can earn interest on your cryptocurrency held on the exchange. You can also easily borrow against your crypto holdings. Notably, Nexo also offers a credit/debit card you can use to access the value of your crypto.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="nexo spot trading dashboard" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334276/nexo-pro.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Fees are beginner-friendly, with no extra trading fees on Nexo&rsquo;s main platform. Instead, Nexo uses a spread that&rsquo;s included in the price. If you choose to use Nexo Pro, the advanced trading platform, you can buy without a spread with trading fees at 0.3% for limit orders, half the cost of Coinbase Advanced.</p><h4>Tradable Coins</h4><p>Nexo offers over 60 cryptocurrencies, including:</p><ul>

With the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/strike/en">Strike</a> app, you can buy any crypto you want, as long as it&rsquo;s Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Built by Bitcoin HODLers for Bitcoin HODLers, Strike lets you put your BTC stacking on autopilot. Choose an investment amount and frequency and set up a payment method. Strike does the rest, delivering your Bitcoin to your Strike wallet on schedule with no fees.&nbsp;You can also buy BTC on demand.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="strike crypto exchange buy BTC" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334278/strike-buy-bitcoin.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Like many other platforms, Strike makes its profit from the spread, but unlike on other platforms, there are no trading fees. You can even withdraw BTC from your Strike wallet to a self-custody Bitcoin wallet without network fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Strike also functions as a payment app, letting you send money globally, but the Bitcoin network &mdash; and specifically Bitcoin&rsquo;s Lightning network &mdash; is the wizardry behind the curtain. The Lightning network is a second layer on the Bitcoin network that enables fast transactions for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>Strike&rsquo;s easy setup and no-fee structure might make it the best Bitcoin exchange for absolute beginners or Bitcoin-only investors.</p><p>The downside, of course, is that if you want to buy other cryptos, like ETH, you have to look elsewhere.

Bitstamp &#8211; Beginner-Friendly Crypto Platform With 80+ Cryptos and No Fees for Low-Volume Traders</h3><p>Bitstamp&rsquo;s fee structure makes it easy to get started with smaller investment amounts. If your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitstamp/en">Bitstamp</a> trading volume is under $1,000 per month, you&rsquo;ll pay <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/fee-schedule/"><u>no trading fees</u></a> on the advanced platform. At $1,000 per month or less (based on trailing 30-day trading volume), limit order fees come in at 0.3%, which is lower than you&rsquo;ll find on Coinbase Advanced, for example. Market orders in the same tier cost 0.40%.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s often a tradeoff to no-fee trades, and in this case, it&rsquo;s withdrawal fees &mdash; which can get spendy. BTC withdrawal fees, for instance, are 0.005 BTC, or about $13 at today&rsquo;s BTC price. If you&rsquo;re taking advantage of Bitstamp&rsquo;s no-fee trades at lower volume, it might be best to let your position build up before withdrawing.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="bitstamp exchange welcome page" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334230/bistamp-vs-bitstamp-pro.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>The platform offers both a simple interface and an advanced interface.

</div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>What is a Cryptocurrency Exchange?</h2><p>A crypto exchange is a marketplace where you can buy cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, with traditional (fiat) currencies, like the USD or GBP. Exchanges work like on ramps, a way to convert your fiat money into crypto and back again if you decide to sell. A crypto exchange or platform also acts as an intermediary, a go-between that allows buyers and sellers to transact without ever meeting, much like a stock exchange.</p><p>Full-featured exchanges like Binance or OKX also allow you to trade one cryptocurrency for another using trading pairs (trade this for that). For instance, you may want to trade some ETH (Ether from the Ethereum blockchain) for BTC (Bitcoin). If there&rsquo;s a trading pair on the exchange, you can trade one for the other, adjusting your crypto portfolio in one trade.</p><p>Some platforms don&rsquo;t offer everything you&rsquo;ll find on an exchange, however, meaning you may not be able to trade one crypto for another. eToro is one example, favoring ease of use over crypto-to-crypto exchanges. Depending on how you trade or invest, this might make eToro a perfect fit. Simpler platforms may forgo the extras that many people won&rsquo;t use but still allow you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, converting your crypto back to cash when you exit your position.</p><blockquote>
<h4>Crypto Exchanges vs. Crypto Brokers</h4>
<p>Both crypto exchanges and crypto brokers provide a way to trade cryptocurrencies. There are differences going on behind the scenes, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchanges use an order book, a list of open buy and sell orders. You&rsquo;re buying and selling against existing orders placed by other traders or market makers. If you use an advanced trading platform on an exchange like Kraken, you can see these orders.</p>
<p>Crypto brokers, on the other hand, are intermediaries between traders and the market. Brokers are in the middle of the transaction and you&rsquo;re really buying from or selling to the broker rather than other traders. The broker then fills the buy or sell order through market makers and orders placed by other traders.</p>
</blockquote><p>Crypto trading platforms also offer basic crypto storage. The exchange or platform provides a built-in crypto wallet called a custodial wallet that you can access with your account login.</p><p>The details above all refer to centralized exchanges, trading platforms run by a company and often regulated by local governments. There&rsquo;s another type of exchange called a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex-in-2021.htm"><u>decentralized exchange</u></a> (DEX) run by computer programs on the blockchain. DEXs let users swap crypto directly from their crypto wallets. We&rsquo;ll focus on the best centralized exchanges in this guide. A third (and less common) type of crypto exchange, called a P2P or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-p2p-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Peer-to-Peer exchange,</u></a> allows buyers and sellers to transact directly.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange Fees</h2><p>You can often avoid deposit fees by linking a bank account and depositing to your trading account from your bank account. Debit card transactions often come with additional fees of up to 4%. But there are some other fees to understand as well.</p><h3>Trading Fees</h3><p>We&rsquo;ll discuss fees for specific types of trades in more detail in a bit, but crypto trading fees can come in several forms, depending on the platform and the type of trade.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Fixed fees and simple trading fees:</strong> Many exchanges and platforms use a specific fee structure for trades that use a simple buy/sell widget as opposed to an advanced trading platform. Often, you&rsquo;ll pay a fixed fee, which varies based on the transaction amount. The fee schedule may convert to a percentage-based fee as the transaction value crosses a certain threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Maker and taker fees:</strong> Advanced trading platforms use a maker/taker fee schedule, with the fee percentage typically driven by your 30-day trading volume. Placing a fixed price limit order maker you a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; because you&rsquo;re making a market for other traders. &ldquo;Takers&rdquo; take liquidity off the market by trading against existing limit orders with a (buy at) market order. Take orders usually cost more in trading fees compared to maker orders.</li>
<li><strong>Spread fees:</strong> The spread generally refers to the difference in price between the highest-priced limit buy order and the lowest-price limit sell order. Exchanges may use a spread fee as the trading fee itself or in addition to a simple trading fee.</li>
</ul><h3>Withdrawal Fees</h3><p>Like trading fees, withdrawal fees come in more than one type.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Fiat withdrawal fees:</strong> Some exchanges charge a fee to withdraw your money from the exchange. On eToro, for example, some transactions require a $5 withdrawal fee. If the exchange uses a fixed dollar amount for a fee, waiting until you can withdraw a larger amount reduces the cost of the withdrawal fee as a percentage of the withdrawal amount.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto withdrawal fees:</strong> If you withdraw crypto from an exchange by sending it to another wallet, you&rsquo;ll pay a network fee. These fees vary by cryptocurrency type and the network to which you withdraw. For example, withdrawing ETH on the Ethereum network may cost several dollars depending on network activity. However, if you withdraw ETH on the Abitrum network, you&rsquo;ll pay pennies rather than dollars. The size of the transaction does not affect network fees, but some platforms may charge a fixed withdrawal fee for crypto transactions.</li>
</ul><h2>How do Crypto Trading Platforms Work?</h2><p>We discussed crypto exchanges as a marketplace to buy crypto with fiat money, such as USD or GBP, for example. Larger exchanges typically attract more buyers and sellers, making the pricing for common cryptos like Bitcoin competitive with the price elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>For creating this marketplace and transferring crypto between buyers and sellers, the exchange typically charges a fee on trades. However, you may find some platforms that don&rsquo;t charge a trading fee. Generally, those platforms make money on the spread instead, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in a bit.</p><p>To comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations, many exchanges also require proof of identity. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges.htm"><u>Some exchanges don&rsquo;t require KYC</u></a>, however. Typically, these include decentralized and P2P exchanges.</p><h3>How Crypto Trades Work</h3><p>Mechanically, there&rsquo;s a lot going on under the hood of a cryptocurrency trading platform.</p><p>Beginner-friendly platforms like eToro obscure the complicated mechanics, giving you a simple trading interface and fee structure.&nbsp;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro open bitcoin trade" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334231/etoro-buy-btc.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>On eToro, you can buy crypto like Bitcoin with USD. When you&rsquo;re ready to sell, you&rsquo;ll get USD in exchange for your Bitcoin. eToro charges a 1% fee to buy and 1% to sell. All of this is reflected in the buying price and selling price, so there are no surprises.</p><p>Advanced exchanges, like OKX or &#65532;Coinbase Advanced, show more of what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes, including the ever-changing order book and executed orders flashing in real time.</p><p>The order book is at the heart of any exchange. As the name suggests, it&rsquo;s a list of open orders. You&rsquo;ll see sell orders stacked on top and buy orders listed at the bottom. These are all limit orders, meaning the trader sets a fixed price for the order. These are also called &ldquo;maker&rdquo; orders because the traders are making a market with their orders.&nbsp;</p><p>Without maker orders, there are no trades because there&rsquo;s no one to buy from or sell to, at least not visibly. As the market-making heroes of the story, maker orders typically earn lower trading fees.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro crypto order book" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334232/coinbase-advanced-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>In the screenshot of Coinbase Advanced above, you&rsquo;ll also see the spread ($0.68) right above the limit buy orders and below the limit sell orders in the order book. Often, the spread on BTC is just $0.01 between the lowest-priced sell order (called the ask) and the highest-priced buy order (called the bid). However, spreads can be wider depending on which orders are open.&nbsp;</p><p>On cryptocurrencies that don&rsquo;t trade often or on low-volume exchanges, you can sometimes see much wider spreads.</p><blockquote>
<h4>Spreads as Trading Fees</h4>
<p>Some platforms and exchanges use the spread as their fee, rather than charging a trading fee, while others might charge both a trading fee and a spread fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, sometimes, a spread isn&rsquo;t a spread as we described earlier. Instead, the spread may be a fixed percentage fee, as seen with Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades. With Coinbase simple trades, you&rsquo;ll pay a trading fee plus a 1% &ldquo;spread.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchanges may use spread fees to lock in a price for your trade because ask prices can change quickly.</p>
</blockquote><p>When you buy or sell without setting a price, it&rsquo;s called a market order. You&rsquo;re buying from or selling to other traders who placed limit orders on the exchange. Another name for a market order is a &ldquo;taker&rdquo; order because you&rsquo;re taking liquidity provided by the maker orders in the order book.</p><p>In the example below, if you wanted to buy 1 BTC, you could place a fixed-price limit order, which may or may not fill, or you could buy with a market order. None of the existing orders offer one full BTC, however, so your order would fill from the bottom of the list and move up in price until you fill your order for 1 BTC. This is called slippage; the order slips into the next order in the order book changing the average price for your order.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro crypto order book trade history" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334233/coinbase-order-book.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>You&rsquo;ll also pay a bit more for the market order on many exchanges due to higher fees for taker orders. For example, Coinbase Advanced charges 0.6% on maker orders but 0.8% on taker orders.</p><blockquote>
<h4>The Role of Market Makers in Crypto</h4>
<p>Odds are good that many of the orders you see in an exchange order book are from market makers rather than individual buyers and sellers. Market makers are people or companies that keep an inventory of an asset ready to sell (and cash ready to buy) while making a profit from the difference between the buy and sell price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This parallels the role of market makers on stock exchanges, where they fill a similar role: reducing spreads and providing liquidity (making a ready trading market available). Typically, market makers earn a very small percentage on the asset they trade, making their profits from volume rather than margin.</p>
</blockquote><h3>How Crypto Storage Works on Exchanges</h3><p>Once you&rsquo;ve made your trade, the exchange holds your crypto for you. Technically, your crypto is in a crypto wallet controlled by the exchange called a custodial wallet.</p><p>Crypto wallets work a lot like mailboxes. You can send things from an address or receive things at an address. In this case, it&rsquo;s crypto rather than bills and postcards.</p><p>Unlike a mailbox, where your mail is hidden from view, the whole world can see the transactions in your crypto wallet, as shown in the transaction below from <a href="https://etherscan.io/"><u>Etherscan</u></a>.</p><p><img class="content-img alignnone lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etherscan history transaction hash" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334234/etherscan.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>The good news is that it&rsquo;s unlikely that the average blockchain detective knows your wallet address belongs to you.</p><p>For many traders, this custodial arrangement with exchanges works well. The exchange provides custody for your crypto and you use your login to access your account. As your crypto balance grows, however, or if you want to do things with your crypto, you may want to research the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm"><u>best crypto wallets</u></a> so you can self-custody your crypto.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Crypto Exchange</h2><p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for the best crypto exchanges for beginners, the best bitcoin trading platform, or the best crypto trading platform for advanced traders, there are several factors to weigh. Features, fees, and safety all play important roles when choosing a platform that fits your trading needs and that won&rsquo;t break the bank with surprise fees. Of course, it&rsquo;s also essential to choose a platform that won&rsquo;t disappear tomorrow, especially as your balance grows.</p><h3>Regulation/Licenses</h3><p>Much of the crypto industry remains unregulated, but some exchanges and trading platforms have taken steps to register with regulators and obtain licenses to operate in certain jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, eToro operates in over 140 countries throughout the world and <a href="https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/regulation-license/"><u>is regulated in several larger trading markets</u></a>.</p><ul>
<li>US: FINRA, SEC</li>
<li>UK: FCA</li>
<li>Australia: ASIC</li>
<li>Europe: CySEC</li>
</ul><p>Regulatory oversight offers an extra safeguard for investors that helps ensure cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto trading platforms follow regulations and conform to best practices. However, where each company is licensed or regulated matters. Exchanges often do business under different business units in various parts of the world. If you live in the UK, but the company is regulated in another country, UK safeguards may not apply.</p><p>Ideally, look for exchanges that are regulated in your country or region. Recently, the FCA named dozens of exchanges that it says are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-09/huobi-kucoin-among-crypto-firms-added-to-uk-fca-s-warning-list"><u>promoting financial services without the FCA&rsquo;s permission</u></a>. While this, in itself, doesn&rsquo;t make the named exchanges unsafe, it does illustrate regulatory risk. Exchanges that come under fire from regulators can be forced to change the business dramatically, as happened with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101"><u>Binance.US and the SEC</u></a>, or may even fall into insolvency, as happened with FTX (also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219"><u>charged by the SEC</u></a>).</p><h3>Available Cryptos</h3><p>Most exchanges offer BTC and ETH, which together represent about 70% of the total crypto market cap. Bitcoin alone represents about 50% of the market and often moves the rest of the market with its ebbs and flows. But you might not find the latest crypto that people are talking about on social media on some of the most popular exchanges.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro crypto selection by market cap" width="725" height="528" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334280/screenshot-from-2023-10-1.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Etoro offers 80 cryptos worldwide, whereas Binance and OKX offer over 350 each. More isn&rsquo;t always better, however, and too many options can be confusing for new and experienced traders alike. But if you have your sights set on a particular cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s only available at a few exchanges, that&rsquo;s likely to drive your decision.</p><h3>Trading Fees and Additional Fees</h3><p>Many exchanges offer competitive fees if you use the advanced platform. However, the advanced platforms often look like a hacker&rsquo;s terminal, with numbers flashing in green and red and trades whooshing by. It&rsquo;s not a welcoming place for beginners. By contrast. simpler trading platforms often come with higher fees.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, using Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades will rack up $3.84 in fees to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin. By comparison, eToro, which also uses a simple trading interface, costs just $1 for the same $100 buying transaction.</p><p>Weigh trading fees in the context of how you&rsquo;ll use the platform. Low fees for advanced trading don&rsquo;t mean much if you think you&rsquo;ll only use the simple trading interface. But also consider other fees that may apply to how you trade. Among these may be deposit fees, withdrawal fees, and inactivity fees.&nbsp;</p><p>To use eToro as an example again, you won&rsquo;t pay a deposit fee, although conversion fees may apply if you&rsquo;re not depositing in USD. However, eToro has a $5 withdrawal fee and an <a href="https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/1835159142/what-happens-if-i-do-not-log-into-my-etoro-investment-account/"><u>inactivity fee</u></a> that kicks in after 12 months with no login. These are both easy to work with, but in some cases, additional fees can create a strong headwind.</p><h3>Crypto Wallet</h3><p>Centralized crypto exchanges and trading platforms offer a built-in crypto wallet, but it&rsquo;s not always obvious. In short, the exchange holds your crypto in a crypto wallet that they control. You access your funds through your account login.</p><p>Many exchanges also offer a separate wallet that allows you to send and receive supported cryptocurrencies or move cryptocurrencies off the platform. For example, Coinbase offers Coinbase Wallet, which supports Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs using a mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center"><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="coinbase crypto wallet dashboard" width="694" height="1392" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334236/coinbase-crypto-wallet.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Coinbase Wallet can be more complicated to set up, though, compared to simpler wallets like eToro&rsquo;s wallet, called eToro Money, or the Strike app, which serves as a Bitcoin Lightning wallet.</p><p>Some traders never need or want a separate crypto wallet, although two benefits of crypto wallets merit consideration.</p><p>Crypto wallets allow you to store your crypto in a wallet you control. The custodial exchange wallets on FTX were controlled by FTX. Customers who held balances on the exchange are now <a href="https://time.com/6236610/ftx-account-holders-money-back/"><u>unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy process</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto wallets allow you to put your crypto to use elsewhere. Crypto held on an exchange usually doesn&#8217;t do much. The price goes up and down, but you often can&rsquo;t use it to earn a yield. However, ETH, for example, can be moved off the exchange and used in decentralized finance&nbsp; (DeFi) applications like Lido or Balancer to earn yield with your crypto.</p><p>The availability of a crypto wallet with the platform&rsquo;s branding is of lesser importance than the ability to move your crypto off the platform to a crypto wallet of your choosing.</p><h3>Trading Tools &amp; Features</h3><p>Consider which tools you&rsquo;re likely to use when trading. OKX and Binance both offer trading bots, for example, which are rules-driven digital traders that work for you 24-7. You may not need these digital gizmos, but you might want access to advanced charts like the customizable TradingView charts on eToro (with 100 available indicators).&nbsp;</p><p>And there isn&rsquo;t always one answer. You might use OKX for its trading bots or Strike for its Bitcoin DCA, while also using eToro for its copy trading, which lets you copy money-making traders trade-for-trade.</p><h3>Available Payment Methods</h3><p>Sometimes, how you can pay for trades (and the fees for those payments) makes all the difference. eToro supports bank deposits, debit cards, and PayPal with no deposit fees. Coinbase also supports all these payment methods but charges a 2.5% fee on PayPal deposits and nearly 4% on debit card transactions.</p><p>Generally, bank transfers are the cheapest way to fund your trading account. But some platforms, like eToro, don&rsquo;t make you choose between convenience and costly deposit fees.</p><h3>Reputation and Customer Service</h3><p>Overall, crypto exchanges have a pretty spotty record when it comes to customer service. Check a rating site like Trustpilot before you make a move. But bear in mind that, like the insurance industry and many other financial services, the crypto industry tends to garner low customer satisfaction ratings.</p><p>Coinbase, for example, has a <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/coinbase.com"><u>1.5 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. Binance isn&rsquo;t much higher with its <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/binance.com"><u>2.1 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>. These are two of the largest crypto exchanges on the planet. eToro is the standout in this group with an impressive <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.etoro.com"><u>4.4 (out of 5) TrustScore</u></a>.</p><p>Also, look for ways you can reach out if you have a question or problem. Many platforms offer chat or email support. A handful, like Coinbase, offer a customer service phone number.</p><h3>Mobile App&nbsp;</h3><p>Nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/"><u>60% of internet traffic</u></a> happens on mobile devices now, so a full-featured mobile app becomes a must for many traders. Both eToro and Coinbase offer mobile apps that closely match the trading experience you&rsquo;ll find on the desktop app.</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro mobile app portfolio dashboard" width="700" height="1342" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334237/etoro-money-wallet.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p><br>Strike, on the other hand, is a mobile-first app, although there&rsquo;s also a Chrome extension available.&nbsp;</p><p>Check the App Store or Play Store ratings for the exchanges you&rsquo;re considering if you think you&rsquo;ll be accessing your trading account with a phone or tablet.</p><h2>Are Cryptocurrency Exchanges Legal?</h2><p>Crypto exchanges are legal in many parts of the world, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, but it&rsquo;s important to note that they&rsquo;re unregulated, meaning the chances of being covered by financial compensation schemes are very slim. However, centralized trading platforms are subject to certain regulations that share a common theme. In the US, for example, exchanges fall under the scope of the <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html"><u>Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</u></a>, which focuses on anti-money laundering (AML) and similar financial crimes. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why you need to prove your identity before you can trade, AML and KYC (<a href="https://www.swift.com/your-needs/financial-crime-cyber-security/know-your-customer-kyc/meaning-kyc"><u>Know Your Customer)</u></a> banking standards are at the heart of this requirement.</p><h3>US Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>In the US, cryptocurrencies fall under the purview of the SEC if they are securities. A security refers to a financial instrument in which there is an investment of money and in which the expected profits are due to the actions of someone else. For example, if you buy TSLA stock, your expected returns are based on the actions of Tesla&rsquo;s management and workers. TSLA is a security. Cryptocurrencies don&rsquo;t all share this third-party element, although the topic is a source of constant controversy with the SEC. The agency <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102"><u>sued Coinbase in 2023,</u></a> alleging the sale of unregistered securities, one of many such lawsuits.</p><p>Complicating the crypto scene in the US further, each of the US states has its own laws and licensing requirements. As a result, many crypto exchanges that operate in the US don&rsquo;t operate in all 50 states.</p><h3>UK Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>Trading crypto is legal in the UK, but <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-bill-2022-factsheets/fact-sheet-cryptoassets-technical"><u>exchanges that operate in the UK must register with the FCA</u></a> and comply with AML rules such as proof-of-identity requirements. The FCA also introduced <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-introduces-tough-new-rules-marketing-cryptoassets"><u>new rules regarding crypto marketing</u></a> designed to protect new investors.</p><h3>Australia Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>Crypto trading platforms operating in Australia <a href="https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/your-industry/digital-currency-cryptocurrency/digital-currency-exchange-providers"><u>must register with AUSTRAC</u></a>, the country&rsquo;s anti-money laundering authority. This brings with it the familiar identity verification requirements we see on most centralized exchanges. Exchanges also fall under the purview of the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/"><u>Australian Securities and Investments Commission</u></a> (ASIC), Australia&rsquo;s equivalent of the SEC in the US.</p><h3>Canada Cryptocurrency Laws</h3><p>In Canada, regulators see crypto assets as securities, a distinction still open to debate in the neighboring US. Like other securities, including stocks, cryptocurrencies are legal in Canada, although the country has enacted tougher rules regarding trading limits, prompting exchanges like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-will-proactively-withdraw-canada-2023-05-12/"><u>Binance to leave the Canadian market</u></a>. The <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/"><u>Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)</u></a> oversees crypto trading in Canada.</p><p>While trading cryptocurrencies is legal in many countries, it&rsquo;s prudent to stay up-to-date on the regulatory climate where you live, as well as which crypto exchanges may encounter trouble with local regulators. After the SEC sued Binance, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/banks-to-cut-off-binance-access-to-us-banking-system-exchange-says.html"><u>US-only exchange lost its banking partners</u></a>, causing temporary chaos in trading for USD-based trading pairs on the platform as there was no easy way to take USD off the exchange.wise</p><h2>Are Crypto Exchanges Safe to Use?</h2><p>No exchange or trading platform is 100% safe to use, but there are ways to reduce your risk. There&rsquo;s also a possibility of outsized gains that might make the risk worth taking. Between 2011 and 2021, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-vastly-outperformed-gold-and-sp-500-over-the-past-decade"><u>Bitcoin rewarded investors with more than 437,000% returns</u></a>.</p><p>First, it&rsquo;s important to understand that there&rsquo;s no government insurance available. The exception is pass-through insurance available on cash balances on platforms like eToro and Coinbase. In both cases, US customers enjoy pass-through FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) on cash balances of up to $250,000. However, crypto assets are not covered by FDIC insurance or any similar program. This theme is carried throughout the crypto industry. For example, eToro (UK) carries <a href="https://www.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Insurance-Disclosure-to-Clients-17.11.2020.docx.pdf"><u>Excess of Loss insurance</u></a>, which safeguards investors against broker insolvency. However, this policy excludes real cryptocurrencies.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no insurance at all. Coinbase carries a policy that <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured"><u>insures against platform breaches</u></a>. But generally, your crypto assets are uninsured.</p><p>By choosing a platform that&rsquo;s regulated in major markets, such as eToro, Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitstamp, you&rsquo;ll have government regulators as allies, a set of well-trained eyes watching over the exchange. You can also look for crypto trading platforms that offer proof-of-reserves (POR) to verify the platform has your crypto. Kraken and OKX both offer POR.</p><p>Lastly, if you trade in size or as your account grows, you can consider moving your crypto to a self-custody wallet like MetaMask (Ethereum) or Electrum (Bitcoin). It comes down to the old adage about eggs and baskets. Moving some crypto off the exchange can reduce your risk if the exchange runs into trouble.</p><h2>Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2><p>Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and brokers like eToro represent the most common way to buy crypto with traditional currencies. But what is a centralized exchange, and what is the alternative?</p><h3>Centralized Exchanges</h3><p>A centralized exchange (CEX) is a crypto trading platform run by a company that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Coinbase may be the most well-known example. When you trade on Coinbase, you&rsquo;re not trading directly with another trader. Instead, you&rsquo;re buying or selling against on order book, a list of open fixed-priced orders on the exchange.</p><p>Centralized exchanges offer a convenient way to convert fiat money, like USD or GBP, to cryptocurrency or to sell crypto for fiat currencies. But centralized exchanges also offer custodial storage, meaning they can hold your crypto for you on the exchange. Similarly, centralized exchanges typically offer ways for you to take your crypto off the exchange.</p><p>Centralization makes is easier to establish fiat on-ramps and off-ramps. In many cases, it also means the exchange may be subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. One potential downside, however, is that the exchange controls your crypto wallet on the exchange. They have the ability to pause or freeze withdrawals.</p><h3>Decentralized Exchanges</h3><p>Where centralized exchanges are run by management teams, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is run by software called smart contracts. A smart contract is a computer program on the blockchain that users can interact with to perform various transactions.</p><p>Instead of an order book, decentralized exchanges typically use liquidity pools. Crypto investors can deposit one or more types of crypto into a liquidity pool, and this pool and other traders use the pool to swap crypto A for crypto B.</p><p>Decentralized exchanges let you trade from within your own crypto wallet, so you don&rsquo;t have to deposit your crypto before making a swap. Swap fees typically come in low as well, often at 0.3% or lower.</p><p>To make swaps on a decentralized exchange, though, you&rsquo;ll need crypto to swap. In many cases, you can buy crypto through a third-party provider partnered with the DEX. Fees can be higher than using a centralized exchange, however.</p><p>Many traders buy on centralized exchanges and then transfer the crypto to a self-custody wallet where they can use their crypto for swaps, to provide liquidity (and earn trading fees), or in several other ways.</p><p>The most popular decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap and Balancer, run on the Ethereum network. Many also support Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum or Polygon.</p><h2>Buy Crypto Within Cash and Payment Apps</h2><p>Sometimes, the best crypto exchanges aren&rsquo;t exchanges at all. Several payment apps, including Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, provide a convenient way to buy popular cryptocurrencies. You won&rsquo;t find a massive selection of hundreds of choices, however. But if you&rsquo;re primarily interested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other cryptos, you may not need to learn a new platform. You can build your stack with an app you may already use daily.</p><h3>Cash App</h3><p>Cash App offers Bitcoin as its only crypto option, but the popular payment platform also offers over 1,800 stocks and exchange-traded funds.</p><p>Bitcoin trading fees on Cash App come in higher than you&rsquo;ll find on an advanced trading platform like Coinbase Advanced or Gemini Active Trader but compare well with user-friendly platforms like Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades.</p><p>For example, to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Cash App, you&rsquo;ll pay $2.25 in fees. Using Coinbase&rsquo;s simple trades, you&rsquo;d pay $3.84 for the same purchase amount. <a href="https://cash.app/help/3103-bitcoin-fees">Cash App Bitcoin fees</a> range from 0.75% to 3%, depending on the transaction amount.</p><p>Cash App also provides a Bitcoin wallet, so you can send or spend your Bitcoin or move it to another crypto hardware wallet if needed.</p><h3>PayPal</h3><p>With a few more cryptocurrencies available, PayPal offers another way to buy popular crypto assets like Bitcoin. In total, PayPal offers five options.</p><ul>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
<li>Bitcoin Cash</li>
<li>Ethereum</li>
<li>Litecoin</li>
<li>PayPal USD (PYUSD)</li>
</ul><p>Like Cash App, PayPal lets you withdraw your crypto to a separate crypto wallet.</p><p>PayPal used a fixed fee schedule to purchase crypto in amounts of $200 and under. At the lowest tier (up to $4.99), you&rsquo;ll pay $0.49. The cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin falls into the highest fixed fee tier at $2.49, or about 2.5%.</p><p>Above $200, fees range from 1.5% to 1.8%.</p><p>PayPal supports crypto purchases for personal accounts but disables the feature for business accounts.</p><h3>Venmo</h3><p>PayPal owns Venmo, and now both platforms offer the same lineup of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Crypto buying and selling fees parallel PayPal as well, with both platforms using a fixed fee schedule for purchases up to $200. A purchase for up $100 worth of Bitcoin costs $2.49 on Venmo.</p><p>Similar to Cash App, you&rsquo;ll need to use the mobile app to buy and sell crypto, however. The web app for both platforms offers limited functionality.</p><h2>How do Crypto Exchange Fees Work?</h2><p>Earlier in the guide, we discussed limit orders, market orders, and spreads. Here&rsquo;s how they all come together to determine crypto exchange fees.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Commission:</strong> Brokers like eToro charge a commission, which is another name for a trading fee. The difference, in eToro&rsquo;s case, for example, is that the commission is a fixed percentage of the order and does not change based on trading volume.</li>
<li><strong>Trading fees:</strong> Exchanges like OKX charge a trading fee based on the value of the trade and your trading volume (usually looking at a 30-day history). These trading fees might also differ depending on whether you place a market order or a limit order.
<ul>
<li><strong>Market orders</strong> (also called taker orders) mean you&rsquo;re buying at market price from the existing orders in the order book. On many exchanges, you&rsquo;ll pay a higher fee for market orders compared to limit orders (up next).</li>
<li><strong>Limit orders</strong> (also caller maker orders) mean you&rsquo;re placing an order at a fixed price. These orders sit on the order book until there&rsquo;s a match or a market order in the price range of your order. You&rsquo;ll usually pay a lower fee for limit orders, but there&rsquo;s also a chance that your buy or sell order might not be filled if the market price is too far away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Spreads: </strong>A spread refers to the price difference between the lowest price limit sell order and the highest price limit buy order. On busy exchanges and with high-volume cryptos like BTC, the spread is often just $0.01. However, we showed a screenshot earlier where the spread was $0.68. For BTC, which trades at over $26,000 currently, that $0.68 spread is still quite small, but for thinly traded cryptos, the spread can be much wider relative to the trading price, possibly causing a sub-optimal trade.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<h4>How Display Fees Work</h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s another type of fee structure you&rsquo;ll see on Coinbase&#8217;s simple trades or Kraken&rsquo;s simple trades, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These easy-to-use trading boxes can come with much higher fees and often use complicated schedules that assign a different fee based on the value of the order and the payment method. Kraken, for instance, calls this a display fee, meaning you&rsquo;ll see it displayed before you make your trade.</p>
<p>Typically, trades with a display fee also bring an additional cost in the form of a spread. In this case, the spread may be much wider than you&rsquo;ll see in order-book spreads. Usually, the spread is in the quoted price, so it&rsquo;s not hidden, but it&rsquo;s also not shown precisely.</p>
<p>Always check the price for your trade &mdash; including spreads and fees &mdash; to be sure the trade still makes sense for you.</p>
</blockquote><p>There are a few other fees to watch out for, but not all exchanges charge these fees. Consider the big picture in regard to costs when choosing the best crypto exchange for your needs. A cryptocurrency trading platform with low trading fees might charge other fees that make trading costlier.</p><ul>
<li>Deposit fees</li>
<li>Withdrawal fees</li>
<li>Conversion fees</li>
<li>Inactivity fees</li>
</ul><p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Bitstamp with no trading fee. If your balance stays at $100 and you want to withdraw, you&rsquo;ll pay about $13 in withdrawal fees or about 13% of your investment&rsquo;s value. However, if you continue buying and your balance grows to $5,000, that same $13 fee drops to 0.26% of your investment&rsquo;s value.</p><p>Weigh how you&rsquo;ll use the platform and how additional fees might affect your trading cost on each of the crypto trading platforms you&rsquo;re considering.</p><h2>How to Use a Cryptocurrency Exchange &#8211; 5 Simple Steps</h2><p>When you&rsquo;re ready to buy cryptocurrency, you can follow these 5 simple steps. We chose <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro</a> for this example because the onboarding process is smooth, the exchange is well-regulated, and crypto trading fees are a flat 1%. This winning combination makes eToro well-suited to new traders.</p><h3>Step 1: Open an Account</h3><p>Visit <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/en">eToro.com</a> to open a trading account. Expect the basics here, like name and address as well as a username and password. You&rsquo;ll also need to provide a phone number for two-factor authentication via text message.</p><h3><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro create account" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334282/screenshot-from-2023-10-1.jpg" data-srcset=""></h3><h3>Step 2: Verify Your Identity and Address.</h3><p>To comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, you&rsquo;ll need to upload a copy of your proof of identity. Accepted forms of ID vary by country, so pay careful attention to the on-screen instructions. In the US, for example, you can use a passport or a valid driver&rsquo;s license.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose an Investment Amount.</h3><p>Think about how much you want to invest. On eToro, you can get started with just $10. Some traders might want to start with a larger amount because eToro also offers stocks and ETFs, which lets you build a diversified portfolio on one platform.</p><h3><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="etoro fund account" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334239/etoro-choose-investment-amount.jpg" data-srcset=""><br>Step 4: Fund Your Account.</h3><p>Choose from PayPal, a bank account, or a debit card, and then link your account for deposits. eToro walks you through the simple steps to link your funding account. In some markets, like the UK, you may also be able to use Neteller or Skill as funding options.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 5: Make Your First Trade.</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s buy some Bitcoin. Look for the search at the top of the page and search for BTC or Bitcoin. If you&rsquo;re looking for something else, just search for the asset you want to trade.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve found what you want to trade, click on buy.</p><p>eToro includes the 1% buy/sell fee in the price, and your order is priced at the ask price we discussed earlier in the guide. Choose a purchase amount and then click on &ldquo;open trade.&rdquo;</p><p><img class="content-img aligncenter lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="buy btc via etoro" width="634" height="719" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/126577/334240/etoro-buy-btc-trade.jpg" data-srcset=""></p><p>Easy enough. Now, your crypto position will show in your portfolio, which you&rsquo;ll find on the left menu. Optionally, you can set a &ldquo;take profit&rdquo; order for the position to lock in profits or a &ldquo;stop loss&rdquo; order to protect your downside.</p><h2>Why Trust Us</h2><p>Our editors are committed to independent and fair reviews. Wherever possible, we use the products or services we review to bring you a real-world perspective on the pros and cons of each.</p><p>For this exchange review, we made real trades with real money. This gives us the ability to speak knowledgeably about each aspect of the exchange and trading platforms reviewed from a user perspective.</p><p>When appropriate, we used a data-driven ranking system to determine which exchanges and trading platforms earned a spot.</p><h2>Our Methodology</h2><p>We evaluated dozens of different exchanges, trading platforms, and crypto trading apps.</p><p>The trading fees shown for each platform reflect the cost of trading at various volume tiers. Where possible, simple trading platforms and advanced trading platforms on the same exchange were also compared. Additionally, we compared the cost to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on each platform.</p><p>In this review of the best crypto exchanges, we looked for benefits that can help you save or make more money while also being mindful of features or limitations that may create a stumbling block for newer users. On each exchange, we used the advanced trading platform or simple trading platform, depending on which options were available, and compared the experiences.</p><p>The best crypto exchange in a given area may not have earned a top pick overall. In ranking the top exchanges, we considered the following criteria.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Simple trades:</strong> We evaluated both trading costs and ease of use for platforms that offered simple buy/sell widgets.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced trades</strong>: For platforms with advanced trading features, we weighed trading options as well as ease of use and charting ability.</li>
<li><strong>Available cryptocurrencies:</strong> Support for Bitcoin was mandatory, but we also evaluated the depth of available cryptocurrencies on each exchange and which other popular or trending cryptos were available.</li>
<li><strong>Overall trading costs:</strong> We considered other fees and expenses people may encounter, including deposit fees, withdrawal fees, inactivity fees, and spread costs.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources for new investors:</strong> We weighed the educational content available on each platform as well as help tip placement near trading widgets that could be confusing for new users.</li>
<li><strong>Security features:</strong> We evaluated account security, custodial storage, and the ability to move crypto assets off the platform if needed.<br>Regulation: Where applicable, we detailed the regulatory agencies that oversee each exchange in major markets.</li>
</ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There&rsquo;s a trading platform available for nearly every trading style. Crypto trading platforms like Kraken and OKX give you room to grow as a crypto trader, but they can be trickier to use as a beginner. eToro, on the other hand, gives you the freedom to diversify your portfolio with crypto, stocks, and ETFs while using a familiar and easy-to-use interface on both desktop and mobile. But one of the top features is copy trading, which lets you copy the trades of successful traders on the platform. This strategy can eliminate the need for technical analysis before making a trade.&nbsp;</p><p>eToro also gives every trader a $100,000 demo account, which provides the perfect sandbox to learn crypto trading before you invest real money. And when you&rsquo;re ready to invest, eToro&rsquo;s flat 1% trading fee on crypto trades makes trading costs easy to understand.&nbsp;</p><div class="raw-html-embed">

Wallet?</strong></h2><p>After buying crypto assets such as Bitcoin and BNB, the tokens need to be stored in a wallet. This ensures that the tokens remain safe at all times. This is not too dissimilar to how traditional money is stored in a regulated bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>At a minimum, crypto wallets enable investors to send and receive tokens. This is conducted on a wallet-to-wallet basis via a public address. A non-custodial crypto wallet is protected by private keys, which provide access to the digital assets remotely &#8211; often via a 12-word backup phrase.&nbsp;</p><p>However, custodial wallets &#8211; which are typically offered by crypto exchanges and brokers, do not enable users to access their private keys. Instead, the private keys will be safeguarded by the respective provider.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the best crypto wallets in the UK go one step further when it comes to core features. For example, the eToro wallet enables investors to buy, sell, and even swap tokens &#8211; in addition to making a deposit with a debit/credit card or e-wallet.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why Crypto Investors Need a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Crypto investors are advised to obtain a secure wallet with the view of keeping their digital assets safe and away from the wrong hands. Once again, this follows the same concept as depositing traditional money in a bank account for safekeeping and easy access to the funds.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of a crypto wallet, access to the funds is often protected by a range of safeguards. For example, custodial wallet providers like eToro will keep the vast majority of client digital assets offline in cold storage. This ensures that the tokens cannot be accessed by a remote hacker.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1950" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_1950_692.jpg 1950w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_1200_425.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_900_319.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_720_255.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_600_212.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222681/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-54-46___media_library_original_300_106.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Other security features include two/three-factor authentication, biometric and facial logins, and IP address whitelisting. Top crypto wallets in the UK will also make the process of sending and receiving funds seamless and convenient.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>The underlying mechanics of Bitcoin and crypto wallets will vary slightly depending on the chosen device type.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, there are a lot of similarities that most crypto wallets possess.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Each crypto wallet will have its own public address. This is similar to an account number and sort code associated with UK banks.&nbsp;</li><li>As such, investors can receive funds by supplying the public address for their crypto wallet.</li><li>Similarly, when sending funds out of the wallet to another person, the public address will need to be entered&nbsp;</li><li>Once the transaction is confirmed, the person sending the funds will pay a blockchain &nbsp;fee, which can vary depending on the network and broader market conditions</li></ul><p>Here&#8217;s an example of what a Bitcoin wallet address looks like:</p><p><strong>3FZbgi29cpjq2GjdwV8eyHuJJnkLtktZc5</strong></p><p>Although it is safe to give a crypto wallet address to other people, it is important to remember that digital assets operate on the blockchain ledger.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that by knowing somebody else&#8217;s public address, it is possible to see how much the wallet is storing, in addition to any previous transactions that have been conducted. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Private Keys</strong></h3><p>All crypto wallets are backed and secured by private keys. This is similar to a password associated with an online banking account. In other words, those with access to the private key can log into the wallet and authorize transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it is crucial that wallet private keys are never shared with anyone. With that said, whether or not the user has access to the private keys will depend on the wallet type.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Custodial wallets are controlled by third parties, such as crypto exchanges. This means that the user will not have access to the wallet&#8217;s private keys. However, if the user forgets their password, they can ask the third party for help regaining access to the wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>Non-custodial wallets, such as Best Wallet, provide users will full control over their digital assets and private keys. No third party can access the wallet without knowing the private keys. However, if the non-custodial wallet device is lost and the user cannot access their private keys, the digital assets will be unrecoverable.</li></ul><h2><strong>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets</strong></h2><p>Choosing the best crypto wallet in the UK is often a decision that needs to focus on the <i>type</i> of storage option.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we cover the main types of crypto wallets available to UK investors.</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Software wallets enable investors to access their crypto funds remotely. This is typically a choice between a mobile app, desktop software, a browser extension, or a centralized web wallet.</p><p>Either way, software wallets make it a convenient process when it comes to sending and receiving funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, some software providers support multiple device types that each connect to one another. For example, eToro offers both a web and mobile wallet with custodial protections. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h3><p>Hardware wallets come in the form of physical devices. Leaders in this space include Trezor and Ledger Nano &#8211; both of which we reviewed earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Hardware wallets offer the highest level of security, but transferring funds can be cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this is that the user must enter the wallet PIN on the hardware device itself in order to authorize the transfer.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>Paper wallets offer a cost-effective way to store crypto assets offline and away from the threats of a remote hacking attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>The user will usually print the wallet&#8217;s private keys onto a sheet of paper via a QR code. Then, the paper will be stored somewhere safe.&nbsp;</p><p>If the user needs to send crypto out of the paper wallet, they can do this remotely from a mobile device by scanning the QR code.&nbsp;</p><p>This option, while cost-effective and safe, makes it extremely cumbersome to transfer funds. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Choose the Best UK Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><p>In this section, we explore some of the most important considerations to make when selecting the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3><p>At a minimum, the best Bitcoin wallets in the UK offer solid security features that are tasked with keeping the crypto assets safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of top-rated security tools to look for include:</p><ul><li>Two or three-factor authentication</li><li>Fingerprint ID</li><li>Cold storage on custodial wallets</li><li>IP address whitelisting</li><li>Device whitelisting</li><li>Notifications on outgoing transactions&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For added security, consider choosing a wallet that is offered by a regulated provider. Both OKX and eToro are authorized and regulated by the FCA to offer trading services in the UK.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Supported Coins</strong></h3><p>The best Bitcoin wallets in the UK support multiple blockchain networks. This ensures that investors can keep their entire crypto portfolio in a single wallet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1998" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_1998_862.jpg 1998w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_1200_517.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_900_388.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_720_310.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_600_258.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/88635/222680/responsive-images/screenshot-2022-09-26-at-09-53-18___media_library_original_300_129.jpg 300w"></figure><p>At eToro, its Money crypto wallet supports more than 500 pairs, while Best Wallet has a built-in decentralized exchange meaning it can trade thousands of different pairs with tokens such as USDT or ETH.</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>The best crypto wallets in the UK are free to use. The only fee that should be payable is when it comes to sending tokens to another wallet address.&nbsp;</p><p>There should be no markup on this, meaning that users simply pay the network fee charged by the underlying blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, fees will also be charged if the wallet provider supports GBP deposits and crypto trading services.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User Experience</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The chosen crypto wallet should offer a suitable user experience that aligns with the objectives of the trader.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a Bitcoin hardware wallet will likely offer superb security, sending and receiving funds can be cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the eToro wallet offers the perfect balance between security and convenience.</p><h2><strong>How to Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet in the UK</strong></h2><p>Overall, we found that Best Wallet offers the best Bitcoin wallet in the UK for investors of all skill sets and trading goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, in this section, we will explain how to get and set up the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/">Best Wallet</a> mobile app in less than five minutes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Download App&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Best Wallet is available through a dedicated mobile app on both Android and iOS &#8211; visit the Play Store or App Store and download the correct app, which should only take 30 seconds to complete.</p><p>A desktop browser extension is also in development and will be launched in the coming months.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" width="1080" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/best-wallet-app-cn.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_1080_648.jpg 1080w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_900_540.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_720_432.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_600_360.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110306/333554/responsive-images/best-wallet-app-cn___media_library_original_300_180.jpg 300w"></figure><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bestwallet/"><strong>Visit Best Wallet Now</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Step 2: Create Account and Choose Security Settings</strong></h3><p>After downloading the app it is time to create an account, this can simply be done with an email address.&nbsp;</p><p>Then it is time to add security settings to your account.

In simple terms, cryptocurrency wallets are software programs or hardware devices that allow users to store, manage, and transfer popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.</p><p>These wallets act as the holder&#8217;s &#8220;portal&#8221; to the crypto market, making it easy to hold crypto assets safely over the long term. Various types of wallets are on offer, such as &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets, which offer varying degrees of safety and functionality.</p><p>We&#8217;ll explore these wallet types in more detail later, but it&#8217;s important to note that all wallets have a &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; key. These keys are essential since they prove asset ownership and enable wallet holders to send/receive funds.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="810" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/crypto-wallets-explained.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_810_540.jpg 810w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_720_480.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_600_400.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267120/responsive-images/crypto-wallets-explained___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>According to a report by <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/">TripleA</a>, it&rsquo;s estimated that over 420 million people worldwide own crypto. Most of these people are based in Asia and North America, although this figure is growing every month. Due to this vast customer base, the importance of using crypto wallets is more significant than ever &ndash; especially since the market is still relatively unregulated compared to &#8220;traditional&#8221; asset classes and hackers and scammers are extremely active.</p><p>Ultimately, crypto wallets act as a way to store crypto safely without keeping it on an exchange or brokerage account, giving an individual more power over their holdings. &nbsp;Although there are various types of crypto wallets with specific features and security measures, all of them are designed to serve this purpose.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>How Do Bitcoin Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>Whether someone&rsquo;s looking to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-with-most-potential.htm">cryptos with the most potential</a> or is more interested in well-established coins, it&#8217;s vital to understand how wallet storage works. Regardless of where the Bitcoin account is held, using a crypto wallet is critical for protecting crypto asset holdings from cyber attackers and other bad actors.</p><p>The simplest way of viewing crypto wallets is as a method for protecting an investor&#8217;s holdings, via access to their public and private keys. As noted above, these keys have essential use cases &ndash; but what do they do? Here&#8217;s a quick overview:</p><ul><li><strong>Public Key</strong>: The public key can be considered the wallet&#8217;s &#8220;account number&#8221; and is used to receive funds from other individuals/businesses.</li><li><strong>Private Key</strong>: The private key is an alphanumeric code unique to each wallet and used to prove ownership of the crypto assets inside. In this sense, the private key is like a password &ndash; meaning it should never be shared with anyone else.</li></ul><p>Crypto wallets store and manage the private key &ndash; <i>not</i> the actual crypto assets. This is because the crypto assets are still held on the blockchain, meaning the private key simply provides <i>access</i> to them.</p><p>Crypto wallets are so important because they use advanced cryptographic techniques to protect the user&#8217;s private key, essentially a password. Different wallets have different approaches, but they can range from DDoS protection to biometric verification &ndash; and even 3D face scans.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1008" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/how-do-they-work.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_1008_698.jpg 1008w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_900_623.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_720_499.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_600_415.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267121/responsive-images/how-do-they-work___media_library_original_300_208.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The best crypto wallets usually offer backup and recovery options that ensure users can&rsquo;t lose access to their crypto. In the past, if a user lost their private key, their crypto assets could never be re-accessed. Nowadays, many wallet providers have recovery seed phrases and other features that can restore access, although it is important individuals also take great care not to share or lose those.</p><p>Whether a user opts for a crypto hardware wallet or a software wallet, partnering with a well-respected provider is essential. Moreover, it&#8217;s also vital that users follow security practices, like ensuring their private keys remain confidential and implementing a backup procedure.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Why Do You Need a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</strong></h2><p>Finding and using the best crypto wallet available is an integral part of the crypto-trading journey for beginners, especially if they plan to hold, trade or manage large sums of crypto. These wallets are essentially for safely storing, sending, and receiving digital currencies, making them like a &#8216;crypto bank account&#8217;.</p><p>As we&#8217;ve touched on earlier, traders need these crypto wallets since they keep the private key safe. The private key is the only way for someone to gain unauthorized access to the user&#8217;s funds &ndash; if this key is kept safe, the funds are inaccessible.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="960" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/why-do-you-need.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_960_639.jpg 960w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_900_599.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_720_479.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_600_399.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267122/responsive-images/why-do-you-need___media_library_original_300_200.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Moreover, many of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-things-to-buy-with-bitcoin.htm">best things to buy with Bitcoin</a> can only be purchased by sending payment from a reputable wallet provider. Since crypto wallets make it easy to send crypto payments, they&rsquo;re vital for buying goods/services online that are denominated in digital currencies.</p><p>Another critical feature of crypto wallets is that they allow users to have complete control over their crypto assets. Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they aren&#8217;t held by intermediaries like banks. Even holding on a centralized exchange comes with its own risk, as FTX customers previously found when the exchange collapsed leading to billions of dollars in investor losses, or if the exchange is hacked &#8211; like has been recently seen with Huobi Global, when $8 million was stolen in September 2023. Thus, having a self-custody crypto wallet will ensure that only the user &#8220;owns&#8221; the associated crypto assets.</p><p>Finally, crypto wallets are also important because they make it easy to access the crypto market. Most wallets allow users to instantly buy/sell crypto from within the wallet&#8217;s interface and many providers offer support for NFTs and DeFi protocols, significantly broadening the investment possibilities.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Types of Crypto Wallets &#8211; Hardware and Software, Hot and Cold, Paper</strong></h2><p>Deciding to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-altcoins.htm">buy altcoins</a> or crypto tokens is a huge decision &ndash; yet choosing where to store them post-purchase is just as important.&nbsp;</p><p>We&rsquo;ve already discussed what crypto wallets are, but there various types of wallets on offer with a litany of language that can leave beginners confused.</p><h3><strong>Software Wallets (Hot Wallet)</strong></h3><p>Software wallets are the most popular type of storage solution for crypto assets, especially for beginners. These digital platforms allow users to store and manage cryptos in a user-friendly manner. The most important thing to note about these wallets is that they&rsquo;re connected to the internet &ndash; which is in stark contrast to hardware wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two main types of software wallets:</p><ul><li><strong>Mobile wallets</strong>: These are smartphone apps designed to provide on-the-go access to the user&rsquo;s cryptos. Mobile wallets are often offered for free by many top exchanges, like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/">Best Wallet</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etoro/">eToro</a>.</li><li><strong>Desktop wallets</strong>: These are applications that can be downloaded and installed on the user&#8217;s computer. Desktop wallets are slightly safer than mobile wallets since they store the user&#8217;s private key locally on the computer &#8211; MetaMask is one such is example.</li></ul><p>Either way, these wallet types are considered &#8220;hot&#8221; since they&#8217;re connected to the internet. This makes them more susceptible to cyberattacks than &#8220;cold&#8221; wallets which have no connection to the internet.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallet)</strong></h3><p>Alternatively, crypto holders can store their assets in hardware wallets, which are also often referred to as cold wallets &#8211; think cold storage &#8211; as they are not connected to the internet until a user connects a physical device.</p><p>A Bitcoin hardware wallet is a physical device used to store the user&#8217;s private keys. These devices usually look like USB sticks and hold the private key offline &ndash; meaning hackers can&#8217;t access it.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1855" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/hardware-wallets.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_1855_667.jpg 1855w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_1200_431.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_900_324.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_720_259.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_600_216.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267123/responsive-images/hardware-wallets___media_library_original_300_108.jpg 300w"></figure><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-crypto-hardware-wallet">Kraken</a>, hardware wallets are one of the most effective ways for a user to protect their private key and are a must for investors or traders who are managing extremely large sums of crypto.</p><p>It is simply not safe to have huge holdings linked to the internet at all times.</p><p>However, these wallets must be connected to another device, such as a laptop or smartphone, to initiate transactions. So, although they have a much higher security level, hardware wallets aren&#8217;t as user-friendly as software wallets.</p><p>Another downside is that as they are physical devices they come with additional cost to purchase &#8211; Trezor&#8217;s latest Model T, for example, costs in excess of $200.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></h3><p>The third wallet type is paper wallets. Unlike an online Bitcoin wallet, paper wallets are a type of &ldquo;cold&rdquo; storage that involves a user writing their public and private keys on a piece of paper.</p><p>The user would then store this piece of paper somewhere safe where nobody else could access it &#8211; for example in a safe, safety deposit box or locker.</p><p>The downside to this approach is that those with paper wallets still eventually need to use a crypto wallet app to spend or transfer digital assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, paper wallets are relatively impractical and considered less safe than the alternatives &ndash; hence why they aren&rsquo;t widely used.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>How to Find Safe Crypto Wallets</strong></h2><p>Finding the best Bitcoin wallet can be tricky &ndash; especially since so many options exist. However, we&rsquo;ve identified three tactics that traders can employ to find safe crypto wallets effectively:</p><h3><strong>Use a Reputable Provider</strong></h3><p>The most important tactic to use is only choosing crypto wallets offered by reputable providers. It&#8217;s a good idea to read online reviews and check a potential provider&#8217;s track record before downloading the wallet that they offer. Many crypto wallet providers are even endorsed by high-profile individuals or businesses, which can boost credibility.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Many of the top providers listed in this guide have a long track record of success in the space and high security scores. However, even highly-trusted wallets can be susceptible to attacks &#8211; Atomic Wallet was one of the leading providers in the space before North Korean hacker group Lazarus stole more than $100 million of customer funds.</p><h3><strong>Consider the Wallet&rsquo;s Security Features</strong></h3><p>When <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-wallet.htm">choosing a Bitcoin wallet</a>, it&#8217;s also essential to thoroughly research the wallet&#8217;s security features. We&#8217;ll explore this further in the next section, although it typically involves checking the type of encryption on offer and deciding whether to use a hot or a cold wallet.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1618" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/consider-security-features.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_1618_728.jpg 1618w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_1200_540.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_900_405.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_720_324.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_600_270.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267124/responsive-images/consider-security-features___media_library_original_300_135.jpg 300w"></figure><h3><strong>Test the Wallet Before Making Large Transfers</strong></h3><p>Finally, it may be best to test out a wallet with a small amount of crypto before fully committing. This minimizes the risk of catastrophic loss while allowing users to test the wallet&#8217;s functionality and security features. Assuming the wallet is up to the task, users can confidently transfer more significant amounts of crypto.</p><h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet for You</strong></h2><p>Much like when choosing between the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ai-crypto-trading-bots.htm">best AI crypto trading bots</a>, deciding which cryptocurrency wallet to use involves analyzing various factors and will also come down to user preference.</p><p>Let&#8217;s take a look at six of the most important factors to consider:</p><h3><strong>Security Features</strong></h3><p>The single most important factor to review when choosing a crypto wallet is its security features. This includes the encryption technology it uses, how it manages the user&#8217;s private key and any backup options it has.</p><p>Many of the best Bitcoin wallets also offer two-factor authentication and biometric verification to enhance security further. There are even wallets that have multi-signature support, which means they have two private keys rather than one.</p><p>Cold wallets are automatically much safer than hot wallets &#8211; due to them not being connected to the internet, hackers cannot access those funds without having physical access to the hardware device.</p><h3><strong>Type of Wallet</strong></h3><p>Another important consideration is the type of wallet to use. This can be boiled down to using either one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-hot-wallets.htm">best hot wallets</a> or a cold wallet. As noted earlier, the former is connected to the internet, while the latter isn&#8217;t.</p><p>A crypto hardware wallet is generally considered the safest way to store a trader&#8217;s private key. However, they can sometimes be impractical; if practicality is the primary concern, a software wallet may be more suitable.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Those trading crypto daily would likely prefer a hot wallet as they want fast and easy access to funds.&nbsp;</p><p>But users should always choose a cold wallet if they are holding large sums of crypto over an extended period of time, and only connect to the internet when they wish to make a specific transaction &#8211; buying, selling or transferring elsewhere &#8211; and then disconnect.</p><h3><strong>User-Friendliness</strong></h3><p>Navigating the market can be tricky for beginners, so user-friendliness is an important consideration. Users should review a wallet&#8217;s interface design and ease of setup, both of which are crucial for making the trading process accessible to beginners.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2828" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/user-friendliness.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_2828_592.jpg 2828w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_1200_251.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_900_188.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_720_151.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_600_126.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267125/responsive-images/user-friendliness___media_library_original_300_63.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Another thing to consider is whether the wallet comes with any help or support. Most prominent providers, like eToro and OKX, have dedicated help centers with answers to the most commonly-asked questions, which can be a blessing to newbie investors.</p><p>Hardware wallets are not particularly difficult to use but add a another step compared to software wallets, with the likes of Trezor not having a mobile app on iOS also another thing to consider.</p><h3><strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3><p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the crypto market is now valued at over $1.08 trillion with tens of thousands of coins available.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the scale of the market, more new coins and tokens are springing up every week &ndash; so it&rsquo;s a good idea to choose the best cryptocurrency wallet for asset selection.</p><p>Almost all crypto wallets will support the largest coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the top wallets also offer support for lesser-known tokens and stablecoins, which can be highly beneficial.</p><p>MetaMask is one of the best wallets for supported cryptos as it has multi-chain functionality and supports a massive range of tokens, as well as those new to the market.</p><h3><strong>Features &amp; Functionality</strong></h3><p>Users should also check out the wallet&#8217;s features and functionality. For example, if a user wishes to invest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-defi-coins.htm">best DeFi coins</a>, they should check whether the wallet provides access to the decentralized web.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2166" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/features-functionality.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_2166_1072.jpg 2166w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_1200_594.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_900_445.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_720_356.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_600_297.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/110261/267126/responsive-images/features-functionality___media_library_original_300_148.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Many wallets also provide functionality for NFT storage alongside their crypto storage options. This can be a great benefit for investors interested in obtaining cryptos and NFTs to create a well-rounded portfolio of digital assets.</p><p>For NFTs specifically, investors who hold images from highly valuable collections should also consider placing them in cold storage and only connecting to the internet when carrying out a specific task such as selling.</p><h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3><p>Finally, users should also consider the fees associated with using a crypto wallet. Most software wallets are free to download and use &ndash; the only fees to be aware of are network fees that occur during transfers.</p><p>As mentioned above, those who choose to use a Bitcoin hardware wallet must be aware that these wallets have an up-front cost since they are physical devices.&nbsp;</p><p>The price of these devices can vary significantly, although it usually ranges between $50 and $300, depending on the provider and model.</p><h2><strong>How to Get &amp; Use a Crypto Wallet</strong></h2><p>Before ending this guide on the best crypto wallets, let&#8217;s look at how to download and use one of these wallets.

The Mega Dice sportsbook also covers in-play betting.&nbsp;</p><p>We should also mention that Mega Dice is a safe offshore casino. It is regulated by the <a href="https://www.kabinetvandegouverneur.org/nl/">Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao</a> and payout requests are always honored on time. Furthermore, deposits are made from the player&#8217;s private wallet, so Mega Dice doesn&#8217;t have access to the player&#8217;s payment details. We also like that players can protect their accounts with two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Offshore Casino</strong></td><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Welcome Bonus</strong></td><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Wagering Requirement</strong></td><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Casino Games</strong></td><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Live Casino?</strong></td><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Sportsbook?</strong></td><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Deposit Methods</strong></td><td style="padding:2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Min.

The pot is split between the top 10 players, based on points. For instance, suppose a player bets $1 per spin and lands a 40x payout.

But players should still check the licensing status of the casino before proceeding. Regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice and Lucky Block display their licensing details at the bottom of their homepage.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Software Providers: </strong>Just as important is the type of software providers that supply games to the offshore casino. We only consider offshore casinos that use regulated and reputable software developers. Examples include Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, Quickspin, and Hacksaw. This ensures that players are gambling in fair and random conditions.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported Games: </strong>Players should also consider what casino games they want to play. We found that the best offshore online casinos support table games, slots, live dealers, and sports betting. Provably fair games are also worth exploring.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Customer Support: </strong>Offshore casinos deal with players from all over the world, so 24/7 customer support should be expected. This is usually offered through live chat. This prevents the need for players to spend money calling a casino located thousands of miles away.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Welcome Package and Ongoing Bonuses: </strong>The welcome package is also important when assessing the best offshore casino online. We like matched deposit bonuses with fair terms and conditions. Mega Dice and Lucky Block both offer a 200% deposit bonus to new players. We also like when offshore casinos offer ongoing bonuses for existing players, such as deposit reloads. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Payment Methods and Terms: </strong>We also explore what payment methods are accepted by offshore casinos. This often ranges from bank wires and debit/credit cards to e-wallets and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we check minimum deposit requirements, payout limits, and withdrawal times</li></ul><h2><strong>What is an Offshore Casino?</strong></h2><p>When using an online gambling site based outside of the player&#8217;s home country, this is defined as an &#8216;offshore&#8217; casino. For example, suppose someone in France plays online slots with a Panama-based casino. As the casino is located outside of France, the player is using an offshore provider.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is often a negative spin on offshore casinos, most operate solid business models. The main concept is that offshore casinos accept players from most countries. This will appeal to players that do not have access to local casino sites.&nbsp;</p><p>This might be because online gambling is banned in the respective country. Or, perhaps the quality and service of domestic casino sites are sub-par. Some players use offshore casinos to obtain certain perks, such as enhanced bonuses or more competitive odds. Offshore casinos are also suitable for players who want to gamble anonymously.&nbsp;</p><p>But this is only the case when players deposit digital assets like Bitcoin. When using traditional payment methods, such as bank wires, offshore casinos must initiate a KYC process. Crucially, not all offshore casinos are legitimate. While platforms like Mega Dice and Lucky Block are regulated and safe, unlicensed offshore providers should be avoided.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How Do Offshore Casinos Work?</strong></h2><p>Offshore casinos are usually located in countries that have favorable gambling laws. This is often in the Central American region, such as Cura&ccedil;ao, Panama, and the Cayman Islands. In turn, this enables offshore casinos to accept players from all over the world.&nbsp;</p><p>After choosing a suitable provider, players will need to open an account. Some platforms, such as Mega Dice, only require an email address, username, and password. In contrast, offshore casinos like BetOnline require much more information &#8211; including the player&#8217;s name, nationality, and residential address.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2246" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_2246_1150.jpg 2246w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_614.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_900_461.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_720_369.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_600_307.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324138/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_300_154.jpg 300w"></figure><p>After the account is opened, players can deposit some funds. The best offshore casinos accept debit/credit cards, e-wallets, bank wires, and cryptocurrencies. Depositing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is often the best option. This usually enables players to avoid a KYC process and have their withdrawals processed instantly.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the account is funded, players can begin gambling. Most offshore casinos support slots, blackjack, video poker, roulette, and other popular gambling games. These are usually provided by reputable software providers, such as Evolution, Pragmatic Play, and Microgaming. This ensures that each gambling game is fair and random.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Offshore casinos enable players to request a withdrawal at any time. If gambling with fiat money, withdrawals must be sent to the same payment that was used to deposit. This ensures that the offshore casino complies with anti-money regulations. Cryptocurrency payouts can be sent to any wallet address, providing lots of flexibility for players.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Safe?</strong></h2><p>The simple answer is yes &#8211; the vast majority of offshore casinos offer a safe gambling experience. This industry is largely based on trust and reputation, so offshore casinos must provide a satisfactory service to players. This means fair gambling conditions, transparent fees, and reasonable payout speeds.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is important to remember that not all offshore casinos are legitimate. Just like any other industry, a small segment of offshore providers do not operate credible businesses. We found that the best offshore casinos are regulated. Many leading providers, such as Mega Dice, Lucky Block, BC.Game, and Metaspins, are licensed by the Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao.&nbsp;</p><p>Strict guidelines must be met by Cura&ccedil;ao-regulated casinos, ensuring that players can gamble safely and fairly. After all, the &nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/about-us">Cura&ccedil;ao Gaming Control Board</a> supervises its domestic casino sites, as it has done since 1999.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Legal?</strong></h2><p>Those using an offshore casino for the first time might be concerned about the legality of this industry. The first point to consider is the location of the offshore provider. That is to say, the casino must comply with the regulations stipulated by the country it is based. This means that those holding a Cura&ccedil;ao gambling license are governed by Cura&ccedil;ao legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, those based in the UK would need to hold a license with the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UK&#8217;s Gambling Commission</a>. There is more flexibility with European casinos, as providers can be regulated by any EU member. Most hold licenses with the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">Malta Gaming Authority</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2294" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_2294_660.jpg 2294w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_345.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_900_259.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_720_207.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_600_173.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324139/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_300_86.jpg 300w"></figure><p>The second point to consider is the location of the player. For example, UK citizens are prohibited from using an online casino that isn&#8217;t regulated by the Gambling Commission. This is why some offshore casinos do not accept players from the UK. This is often the case with players from the US too. Crucially, the onus is on the offshore casino, not the players themselves.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Offshore casino laws are complex and difficult to enforce. Many offshore casinos do not have KYC processes, as permitted by their respective license issuer. This is the case when offshore casinos accept cryptocurrency payments, rather than debit/credit cards, bank wires, etc. In this instance, players are not asked for their country of residence when signing up.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Are Offshore Casinos Fair?</strong></h2><p>Most offshore casinos offer a fair gambling experience. This will be the case when using a regulated offshore provider like Mega Dice. For example, Mega Dice has an automated payment system, so deposits and withdrawals are processed instantly. This means players do not need to wait for payments to be approved manually by the casino.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, regulated offshore casinos like Mega Dice offer games from licensed software providers. This includes the likes of NetEnt, Novomatic, Pragmatic Play, Hacksaw, Push Gaming, and Microgaming. All of these software providers must use <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/page/test-houses">regulated testing houses</a> when launching a new game. Put simply, this tests that the casino game is fair and random.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we also came across offshore casinos that use unlicensed software providers. These providers do not have their games audited by regulated third parties. This means that games are not tested before they are launched. Ultimately, the best practice is to stick with regulated offshore casinos that offer games from regulated and reputable software providers.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Offshore Casinos?</strong></h2><p>Offshore casinos do not develop their own games. On the contrary, games are supplied by software providers. This means that supported games will depend on <i>which</i> software providers the offshore casino has done deals with.&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases, the best offshore casino sites offer the following games:</p><ul><li><strong>Table Games</strong>: All offshore providers supply table games, considering that this is the most popular casino product. At a minimum, this will include blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and video poker. To ensure players stay entertained, offshore casinos usually offer different variations of each table game. For instance, roulette can often be played with either the European or American rules. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Live Dealers</strong>: Offshore casinos also offer live dealers. This means that players are connected with a human dealer in real-time. For instance, suppose a player opts for live roulette. After placing their bets on-screen, the dealer will spin the roulette wheel &#8211; which is recorded live and shown to players. This offers an immersive offshore casino experience.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Slots</strong>: The best offshore casinos also offer a comprehensive library of slot games. This often includes bonus buys, Mega ways, and classics. Some slots connect to progressive jackpot networks, offering 7-figure payouts. It&#8217;s best to stick with slots with a high <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-to-calculate-return-to-player-rtp">return-to-player (RTP)</a>. This reduces the house edge and increases the payout frequency. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Provably Fair</strong>: Provably fair games are relatively new in the offshore casino space. These are casino games backed by blockchain technology &#8211; ensuring transparency and fairness. Some of the most popular provably fair games include Aviator, plinko, keno, dice, and mines.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sports Betting</strong>: Some offshore casinos double as a sportsbook. Mega Dice, for example, offers competitive odds on American football, tennis, cricket, baseball, ice hockey, and many other sports. It also offers in-play betting, allowing players to gamble on sporting events that are still in progress.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Players can check what games an offshore casino supports by visiting its website.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Offshore Casino Bonuses &amp; Promotions</strong></h2><p>We found that the best offshore casinos offer lucrative bonuses when opening an account for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes the following:</p><h3><strong>Matched Deposit Bonuses&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The matched deposit bonus is simple; the offshore casino will increase the initial payment made by the player. Each matched deposit bonus will come with a percentage amount and a limit.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, Mega Dice matches the first deposit by 200%, up to 1 BTC.&nbsp;</li><li>Lucky Block also matches the initial payment by 200%, but up to &euro;10,000.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Players will need to wager the bonus a minimum number of times before they can withdraw the funds. This prevents players from claiming a bonus just to cash it straight out.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, the Mega Dice matched deposit bonus comes with 40x wagering requirements. This means that $40 needs to be wagered for every $1 received in bonus funds.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Players should also check the terms and conditions to see what games the bonus funds can be used on. Slots usually contribute 100% to the bonus target. Live dealer games often contribute just 10% &#8211; sometimes less. This will make the wagering requirements even more difficult to meet.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Free Spins&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Some offshore casinos offer slot-related bonuses, known as &#8216;free spins&#8217;. The player can use the free spins on selected slot games without using their own balance. So no risks need to be taken.&nbsp;</p><p>After using the free spins, winnings will need to be wagered. Once the wagering requirements have been met, players can withdraw their winnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Mega Dice offers 50 free spins to new players that deposit &euro;20 or more. The free spins can be used on Wanted Dead or a Wild and come with wagering requirements of 40x.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When claiming a free spins bonus, check the value of each spin. For example, suppose each spin is worth $2. If a free spin lands a multiplier of 50x, the player wins $100. But if the free spin is worth just $0.25, the 50x win is reduced to $12.50.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>No Deposit Bonuses&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Looking for an offshore casino no deposit bonus? The best option that we came across is BC.Game&#8217;s &#8216;Lucky Wheel&#8217; promotion.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="742" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_742_1184.jpg 742w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_720_1149.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_600_957.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_300_479.jpg 300w"></figure><p>After opening an account with BC.Game &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t require any personal information, players can spin the Lucky Wheel to win up to 5 BTC. In addition, BC.Game also offers a 180% matched deposit bonus of up to $20,000. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>VIP Club&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Some of the best offshore casino bonuses are offered to players that already have an account. These bonuses are often found in the VIP club, which rewards long-term players.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples include:</p><ul><li>Daily or weekly deposit reload bonuses</li><li>Free spins</li><li>Cashback and rakeback&nbsp;</li><li>Cash prizes</li></ul><p>Moreover, VIP clubs also offer other perks, such as priority withdrawals and a personal account manager. There is rarely a need to apply &#8211; players are automatically enrolled. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Best Offshore Casino Bonuses 2023&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The table below highlights the best offshore casino bonuses for 2023, alongside their wagering requirements and promo code.&nbsp;</p><figure class="table" style="float:left;"><table><tbody><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Offshore Casino</u></strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Bonus</u></strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Wagering Requirement</u></strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Promo Code</u></strong></td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Mega Dice</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">200% matched deposit bonus of up to 1 BTC and 50 free spins</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">40x</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Lucky Block</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">200% matched deposit bonus of up to &euro;10,000 and 50 free spins</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">When the original deposit is wagered six times, Lucky Block releases 10% of the bonus amount.</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>BC.Game</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">The first deposit is matched by 180% up to $20,000</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">Bonus funds are paid in BC Dollars and released as follows: Wager * 1%* (20)%</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Metaspins</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">100% deposit bonus of up to 1 BTC</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">25x the deposit and bonus amount</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>BetOnline</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">100% casino deposit bonus of up to $1,000.

After all, deposits and withdrawals form an integral part of the online gambling experience.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Traditional Payment Methods</strong></h3><p>Most offshore casinos support traditional payment methods. This enables players to deposit funds in their domestic currency, such as euros or pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Debit/credit cards issued by Visa and MasterCard are usually accepted. Some offshore casinos also accept American Express and Discovery.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2312" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_2312_1118.jpg 2312w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_1200_580.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_900_435.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_720_348.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_600_290.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122442/324145/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-16-at-___media_library_original_300_145.jpg 300w"></figure><p>However, it is crucial to check what fees apply when using a debit/credit card. This is also the case with e-wallets. For example, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on debit/credit cards, Skrill, and Neteller. &nbsp;</p><p>Withdrawal fees should also be considered. For instance, 7bit Casino charges 2.5% on bank wire payouts.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Looking for a chargeback offshore casino? It is important to note that initiating a chargeback on casino losses is illegal. Chargebacks should only be used if an unauthorized payment was taken by the offshore casino.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Cryptocurrency Payments&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>A much better alternative when funding an offshore casino account is cryptocurrencies. For example, Mega Dice offers fee-free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it supports some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fastest-growing-cryptocurrency.htm">fastest-growing cryptocurrencies</a>, like Dogecoin, BNB, and Cardano.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Mega Dice offers KYC-free accounts when gambling with cryptocurrencies. Not to mention instant payouts. We also found that cryptocurrency payments come with lower minimums. For example, the minimum Bitcoin deposit at Lucky Block is just 0.0001 BTC, or about $3.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Offshore Casino Software Providers</strong></h2><p>We mentioned earlier that offshore casinos use third-party software providers when building their gaming suites. So it&#8217;s important to check the reputation of each provider before proceeding.&nbsp;</p><p>To offer some insight, Mega Dice, one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vpn-friendly-casinos.htm">best VPN-friendly casinos</a>, has partnerships with over 50 reputable software providers. This includes NetEnt, Hacksaw, Fantasma, Fugaso, Mascot Gaming, Evolution, Playson, Kalamba, and Pragmatic Play.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of these providers are regulated by tier-one gambling bodies like the Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority. This means gaming outcomes are fair and random. Plus, licensed software developers have their games audited &#8211; before <i>and</i> after they are launched.</p><h2><strong>New Offshore Casinos &#8211; What to Look for</strong></h2><p>New offshore casinos need to stand out in the market &#8211; so they often go above and beyond to attract players. This begins with the welcome package. New online offshore casinos will offer huge bonuses to new players, often as a matched deposit with free spins.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Mega Dice is one of the best new offshore casinos. It offers a 200% deposit bonus and 50 free spins to first-time customers. However, while reputable market entrants like Mega Dice are regulated, many aren&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p><p>We strongly suggest that players avoid unregulated offshore casinos &#8211; irrespective of whether they are new or established.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Play at an Offshore Casino</strong></h2><p>In this section, we explain how to gamble online at an offshore casino.

Mega Dice &#8211; Overall Best Offshore Online Betting Site (Regulated and Instant Payouts) &nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/"><strong>Mega Dice</strong></a> ranks as the overall best offshore betting site online. First and foremost, Mega Dice is a safe and trusted gambling provider. It is regulated by the <a href="https://www.kabinetvandegouverneur.org/nl/">Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao</a>, which is one of the most stringent offshore licensing bodies. This means that players can rest assured they are using a legitimate offshore sports betting site.&nbsp;</p><p>Mega Dice is primarily a crypto-centric platform. It accepts Bitcoin and some of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-altcoins.htm">best altcoins</a>, such as Ethereum, Tether, and Dogecoin. One of the main benefits of gambling with cryptocurrencies is that players can open an anonymous account. This means no personal information or KYC requirements.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2294" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122058/323042/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122058/323042/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_2294_1258.jpg 2294w, https://cimg.co/news/122058/323042/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_1200_658.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122058/323042/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_900_494.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122058/323042/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_720_395.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122058/323042/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_600_329.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122058/323042/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-___media_library_original_300_165.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Moreover, Mega Dice offers instant withdrawals to those gambling cryptocurrencies.

Mega Dice and Lucky Block are regulated by the Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao. Players should also explore the offshore bookie&#8217;s reputation. Check gambling review websites and forums for clarity. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Accepted Payment Methods: </strong>The best offshore betting sites accept a wide range of payment methods. In addition to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this also includes debit/credit cards, bank wires, and e-wallets.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Minimum Deposit Requirements: </strong>It&#8217;s best to start off small when using a new offshore bookie. As such, players should check the minimum deposit requirement for their preferred payment method.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Payout Speed and Frequency: </strong>Leading offshore bookies like Mega Dice offer instant payouts. However, some offshore betting sites are known to take much longer. Check this before proceeding. Moreover, assess how often the payments team processes withdrawals. Some offshore bookies only approve payouts during the week. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported Betting Markets and Games: </strong>Most offshore betting sites offer a sportsbook, casino games, and live dealers. But this will vary from one provider to the next. We prefer offshore bookies that offer a wide range of betting markets. Sportsbook fans should also check how competitive the bookie&#8217;s odds are. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bonuses and Promotions: </strong>New players should expect a generous welcome package when signing up with an offshore bookie. This usually includes a matched deposit bonus. Sportsbooks like Mega Dice and Lucky Block also throw in 50 free spins. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>The above checklist will allow players to choose the most suitable offshore bookie in 2023. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is an Offshore Betting Site?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, offshore betting sites operate outside of the player&#8217;s home country. For example, suppose a player from Australia uses an online sportsbook in Canada. In theory, this would be classed as an offshore betting site.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the term is more commonly used to describe sportsbooks based in countries with more flexible gambling regulations. In many cases, the best offshore betting sites are located in Cura&ccedil;ao. This offers players a safe and trusted gambling experience. Some offshore betting sites are based in Panama, and others in the Isle of Man or Bermuda.&nbsp;</p><p>There is often a misconception that offshore betting sites are unsafe. While there are certainly offshore bookies that should be avoided, some have an excellent reputation for customer safety. For example, Mega Dice is a regulated offshore sportsbook that honors instant withdrawals without limits.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Cloudbet has been offering offshore gambling services for over a decade. While BetOnline has been in this game for more than 25 years. Players should, however, do lots of research when using a betting site outside of their home country. After all, should any issues arise, players will need to contest an operator that is potentially based thousands of miles away.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How do Offshore Sports Betting Sites Work?</strong></h2><p>Offshore betting sites work the same as traditional gambling operators. Players deposit funds, gamble, and hope to walk away with some winnings. However, there are some differences that also need to be considered.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, some offshore betting sites specialize in cryptocurrency payments. These providers usually allow players to gamble anonymously. This removes the need to go through a conventional KYC process, which requires a government-issued ID and proof of address.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2196" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323855/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323855/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_2196_1302.jpg 2196w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323855/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_711.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323855/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_900_534.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323855/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_720_427.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323855/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_600_356.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323855/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_300_178.jpg 300w"></figure><p>That said, many offshore betting sites also accept fiat money payments. For example, Mega Dice and Lucky Block support debit/credit cards issued by Visa and MasterCard. But because fiat money is being used, traditional KYC processes will apply.&nbsp;</p><p>With this in mind, players need to choose whether they want to deposit cryptocurrencies anonymously or fiat money with a KYC procedure. Another difference with offshore betting sites is that they usually accept players from most countries.&nbsp;</p><p>This appeals to players who are based in countries with strict gambling laws, such as the US, Thailand, or Malaysia. Offshore betting sites also appeal to players in the UK who are restricted from gambling because of GamStop self-exclusions.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Players might also choose to gamble on an offshore betting site for tax advantages. This is because many offshore bookies are based in low or zero-tax countries. While there are many benefits to using an offshore betting site, players should also consider the risks.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Are Offshore Betting Sites Safe?</strong></h2><p>Safety is the most important consideration to make when exploring the best offshore betting sites. So what steps can players take to assess the legitimacy of an offshore bookie? First and foremost, players should check whether or not the offshore bookie is regulated, and by whom.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For instance, we mentioned earlier that the best betting sites in this space hold a Cura&ccedil;ao e-Gaming license.&nbsp;</li><li>These licenses are issued by the Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao.&nbsp;</li><li>Moreover, licensees are supervised by the <a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/about-us">Cura&ccedil;ao Gaming Control Board</a>, a government-backed organization that was first founded in 1999.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After checking the regulatory status of an offshore bookie, players should verify its license number. Not only will this ensure that the betting site is actually regulated, but that its license is still valid.&nbsp;</p><p>Players should also check reviews from current and past players. There are many third-party websites that allow players to rate and review offshore casinos, so these are worth checking out.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, many offshore betting sites are safe, credible, and legitimate. But this isn&#8217;t always the case. So conducted due diligence is a must before proceeding.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Are Offshore Betting Sites Legal?</strong></h2><p>The legality of offshore betting sites is a complex talking point. There are generally two considerations that need to be made.&nbsp;</p><p>First, players should assess the legal status of the betting site itself, in terms of where it&#8217;s located.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For example, it&#8217;s safe to say that a Cura&ccedil;ao-based betting site regulated by the Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao is operating <i>legally</i>.&nbsp;</li><li>However, a UK-based betting site that isn&#8217;t regulated by the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UK&#8217;s Gambling Commission</a> would be operating <i>illegally</i>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Second, the legality of an offshore betting site also depends on where its players are based. For example, some countries have very strict gambling laws and thus, do not allow their citizens to gamble online. This is the case irrespective of where the betting site is based.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1996" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323888/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323888/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_1996_850.jpg 1996w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323888/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_511.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323888/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_900_383.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323888/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_720_307.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323888/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_600_256.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323888/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_300_128.jpg 300w"></figure><p>However, in some instances, it&#8217;s challenging for offshore betting sites to enforce gambling laws that are upheld in other jurisdictions. After all, the same laws likely don&#8217;t apply in the respective offshore country.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, some offshore betting sites do not have a KYC policy. This is often the case with crypto-centric bookies like Mega Dice, Lucky Block, and BC.Game. As players are not required to provide any personal information (including their nationality), restrictions do not apply.&nbsp;</p><p>Some offshore betting sites will block players from certain countries, especially the US and the UK. This is where the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vpn-friendly-casinos.htm">best VPN-friendly casinos</a> come in. Players simply use a VPN to bypass these restrictions. Everything considered, the regulatory landscape of offshore gambling is both complex and interpretative</p><h2><strong>Are Offshore Betting Sites Fair?</strong></h2><p>Just like onshore gambling sites, most offshore bookies are fair. The reality is that a small minority of operators will give the wider industry a bad name. This is why players should do their own research before signing up with an offshore betting site.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Whether or not an offshore betting site is fair depends on its regulatory framework. For example, regulated offshore bookies must answer to their license issuers. If guidelines are not adhered to, then the offshore bookie could be fined. Even worse, it could lose its license. With this in mind, regulated offshore betting sites are the way to go.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Unregulated offshore bookies do not answer to a gambling authority. This increases the risks significantly. After all, if there aren&#8217;t consequences to poor practices, the bookie will operate in its own interests, rather than the player.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Games Can You Play at Offshore Betting Sites?</strong></h2><p>The best offshore online betting sites typically support the same games as onshore operators.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Sports Betting</strong>: All of the offshore betting sites discussed today have a fully-fledged sportsbook. In addition to sports, this often includes horse racing and esports betting. Moreover, the best offshore bookies offer in-play betting.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Slots</strong>: Offshore betting sites usually offer a wide selection of slot games. This includes Megaways, bonus buys, and jackpots. Each slot game will have its own RTP, maximum payouts, and minimum bet size.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Blackjack</strong>: One of the most popular games available on offshore betting sites is blackjack. Players can usually bet from just $1 per hand. There are many variations of blackjack, so players should check the rules and payouts before proceeding. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Roulette</strong>: Most offshore betting sites support American, French, and European roulette. Other variations are available too, such as Lightning and VIP roulette.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Baccarat</strong>: Another popular table game is baccarat. The objective is to bet on whether the player or banker will score the higher hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Live Dealers</strong>: The best offshore betting sites support live dealer tables. This usually includes blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, not to mention live game shows and fixed-odds poker.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Provably Fair</strong>: Many offshore bookies specialize in crypto payments, so they also offer provably fair games. These are instant-win games backed by the blockchain. Examples include crash, plinko, mines, Hi-Lo, keno, and dice. Some platforms also offer provably fair slots and table games. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Top-rated offshore bookies like Mega Dice and Lucky Block support all of the games listed above.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Offshore Betting Sites Bonuses &amp; Promotions</strong></h2><p>Players will often use offshore betting sites to claim generous bonuses and promotions.&nbsp;</p><p>Read on to discover the best offshore bookie bonuses for 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Matched Deposits</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Most offshore bookies offer a matched deposit bonus to new customers. After making an initial deposit, it will be boosted by a certain percentage, up to a maximum amount.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Mega Dice &#8211; a regulated offshore sportsbook, offers a 200% deposit bonus of up to 1 BTC</li><li>Suppose a new customer opens an account and deposits $500 worth of Bitcoin</li><li>After making the deposit, Mega Dice will match it by 200%, or $1,000</li><li>In addition to the $1,000 bonus, the player has their original deposit of $500</li><li>As such, the player now has $1,500 in bonus funds&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Lucky Block also offers a 200% deposit boost, capped at &euro;10,000.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Like most bonuses, matched deposits come with wagering requirements. This means the bonus needs to be wagered a number of times over before it can be cashed out. For example, a $100 bonus with wagering requirements of 20x would require at least $2,000 worth of bets. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Free Spins</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Many offshore betting sites also support slot games. As such, free spins bonuses are often available.&nbsp;</p><p>Mega Dice and Lucky Block both offer new players 50 free spins. These can be used on Wanted Dead or a Wild, a popular slot game.</p><h3><strong>No Deposit Bonus</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Offshore betting sites are in the business of making a profit. As such, they rarely offer an offshore betting site no deposit bonus.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="742" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_742_1184.jpg 742w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_720_1149.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_600_957.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323887/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_300_479.jpg 300w"></figure><p>That said, BC.Game offers new players a risk-free spin on its Lucky Wheel, which comes with three levels. Within each level, players can target a jackpot of 1 BTC, 3 BTC, and 5 BTC. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Cashback</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Some offshore bookies offer cashback. While not ideal, this allows players to recoup some of their losses.&nbsp;</p><p>The best cashback bonuses come without wagering requirements. This means that players can withdraw the cashback funds straightaway.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Odds Boosts&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>We also like offshore betting sites that offer odds boosts. This will often be on selected games or leagues. For example, Mega Dice is currently offering enhanced odds on English Premier League games.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucky Block is also great for odds boosts. Every day, the Lucky Block team creates an accumulator with enhanced odds. These are usually odds-on favorites.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Best Offshore Betting Site Bonuses 2023&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Now let&#8217;s package everything together by summarizing the 10 best offshore betting bonuses available in 2023.</p><figure class="table" style="float:left;"><table><tbody><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Offshore Betting Site</u></strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Bonus</u></strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Wagering Requirement</u></strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong><u>Promo Code</u></strong></td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Mega Dice</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">200% matched deposit bonus of up to 1 BTC and 50 free spins.</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">40x</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Lucky Block</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">200% matched deposit bonus of up to &euro;10,000 and 50 free spins.</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">When the original deposit is wagered six times, Lucky Block releases 10% of the bonus amount.</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>BC.Game</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">The first deposit is matched by 180% up to $20,000.</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">Bonus funds are paid in BC Dollars and released as follows: Wager * 1%* (20)%</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>Heybets</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">No welcome bonus is offered</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;"><strong>BetOnline</strong></td><td style="border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom;">50% deposit bonus of up to $1,000.

That said, we found that some of the best offshore betting sites are relatively new in the market.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Mega Dice was only launched in 2023 &#8211; but it is already regulated by the Governor of Cura&ccedil;ao. Moreover, Mega Dice offers instant withdrawals without any limits. Player reviews of Mega Dice are also very positive in the public domain.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When choosing a newly launched offshore betting site, consider its regulatory status. Players should also ensure that it offers competitive odds, fair limits, and fast payouts. All of this information can usually be found by browsing the operator&#8217;s website. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>We found that new offshore bookies usually offer generous welcome packages with fair wagering terms. For example, Lucky Block was launched in late 2022 and continues to attract players with its 200% deposit bonus. For every 6x wagered, 10% of the bonus can be withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Payment &amp; Withdrawal Options at Offshore Sportsbooks</strong></h2><p>Accepted deposit and withdrawal methods will vary depending on the chosen offshore betting site.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s explore the most commonly accepted options.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Debit/Credit Cards</strong></h3><p>Most offshore bookies accept debit/credit cards issued by Visa and MasterCard. The payment should be processed instantly.&nbsp;</p><p>However, fees are often high when using a debit/credit card at an offshore betting site. This is because offshore bookies are usually based in countries that require correspondent banks to process payments. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Bank Wires</strong></h3><p>Bank wires are often the cheapest payment method for players. Rarely do offshore betting sites usually charge fees for incoming bank wires. However, fees will usually apply when making a withdrawal.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, bank wires are the slowest payment method to use. It can often take several days before the funds are credited to the player&#8217;s account.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>E-Wallets</strong></h3><p>Some offshore betting sites accept e-wallets like Paypal, Skrill, and Neteller. E-wallet payments are usually instant, but fees will vary considerably.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, players often need to pay fees twice &#8211; once to the e-wallet provider and the other to the betting site. That said, e-wallet payments are usually credited instantly.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Crypto</strong></h3><p>We found that the best way to deposit funds into an offshore betting site is crypto. First and foremost, crypto payments usually allow players to gamble anonymously &#8211; meaning no KYC requirements. This is the case with Mega Dice, Lucky Block, and BC.Game.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, crypto payments offer the lowest fees. Irrespective of the amount being transferred, crypto transaction fees rarely cost more than a couple of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, crypto-centric betting sites like Mega Dice offer instant payments. This means the withdrawal will be approved automatically, so players receive their funds in minutes. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Offshore Betting Site Software Providers</strong></h2><p>The best offshore betting sites not only offer a sportsbook but traditional casino games too. Games like slots, blackjack, and roulette are provided by third-party software developers.&nbsp;</p><p>Some software providers are regulated and have their games tested by licensed auditors. This includes NetEnt, Microgaming, Pragmatic Play, and Evolution. These software providers supply games to Mega Dice, Lucky Block, and many other reputable offshore bookies. &nbsp;</p><p>There are also software providers that do not have regulatory oversight. This means that their games aren&#8217;t tested before they are launched on casino sites.&nbsp;</p><p>Players should only consider using an offshore betting site that has licensing agreements with reputable and regulated software providers.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Play at an Offshore Betting Site</strong></h2><p>Getting started with an offshore betting site is simple. Players will need to open an account, make a deposit, and place their preferred bets.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#8217;ll use <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice</a> for this tutorial, but the process is similar across most offshore bookies.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Open an Account</strong></h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2076" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_2076_1262.jpg 2076w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_729.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_900_547.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_720_438.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_600_365.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323876/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_300_182.jpg 300w"></figure><p>First, head over to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/mega-dice/">Mega Dice website</a> and click on the &#8216;Sign Up&#8217; button.

Moreover, there is no requirement to verify the stated email address.&nbsp;</li><li>This allows players to open a Mega Dice account in a matter of seconds.

Players have two options in this regard.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>First, most players at Mega Dice deposit cryptocurrencies. This enables them to gamble anonymously and benefit from instant withdrawals.&nbsp;</li><li>Second, players can also deposit funds with a debit/credit card. This will trigger a KYC process, so players will need to upload a copy of their government-issued ID.</li><li>Either way, Mega Dice offers a 200% deposit bonus on the initial payment. This is capped at 1 BTC, or the currency equivalent. &nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>Step 3: Search for a Betting Market&nbsp;</strong></h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="2136" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323878/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/122429/323878/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_2136_1186.jpg 2136w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323878/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_1200_666.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323878/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_900_500.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323878/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_720_400.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323878/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_600_333.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/122429/323878/responsive-images/screenshot-2023-08-15-at-___media_library_original_300_167.jpg 300w"></figure><p>Now that the Mega Dice account has funds, players can choose their preferred gambling game. Mega Dice supports slots, table games, and live dealers.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>But in this tutorial, we&#8217;ll explain how to find a suitable sports betting market. First, click on the &#8216;Sports&#8217; button and choose a sporting event from the left-hand dashboard.&nbsp;</li><li>We have selected &#8216;Soccer&#8217;.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money.
 
More and more people and companies are starting to use it. Some of this money can be spent on the same goods and services we pay for with traditional &ldquo;fiat&rdquo; currencies &ndash; dollars, euros, yen, and&#8230;</p><p>What is Cryptocurrency? It is a form of digital money, in short. For the long answer, keep reading our &ldquo;What is cryptocurrency&rdquo; guide.</p><p>More and more people and companies are starting to use it. Some of this money can be spent on the same goods and services we pay for with traditional &ldquo;fiat&rdquo; currencies &ndash; dollars, euros, yen, and so on. Some cryptocurrencies, though, are only for use in closed systems, to pay for a specific platform&rsquo;s services. &ldquo;What is cryptocurrency and how does it work&rdquo; is a common question that our guides are striving to answer what is cryptocurrency for beginners.</p><p>The total value of all cryptocurrencies in use around the world reached nearly USD 600 billion by the end of December 2017, almost 40 times more than a year earlier. Some people buy cryptocurrency simply hoping its price will increase. But, setting speculation and investment aside, cryptocurrency is becoming increasing popular as a means of paying for goods and services. There are a number of reasons for that:</p><p>&#8211; It&rsquo;s secure and impossible to counterfeit due to the complicated mathematics and military-grade cryptography that are involved. <br>
&#8211; It&rsquo;s decentralized and more efficient &ndash; you own your cryptocurrency and no bank or government is needed to issue the money, and no middleman is needed to transfer your funds. That can make your transactions cheaper and quicker (though not always).<br>
&#8211; There are more and more opportunities to use cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services all around the world.<br>
&#8211; It helps people without access to traditional banking become part of the worldwide financial system.<br>
&#8211; It&rsquo;s programmable money which offers many more options for how it can be used and adapted to one&rsquo;s needs.<br>
&#8211; It offers new ways for businesses to reach new customers and raise capital.<br>
&#8211; Getting started with cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly simple.</p><p>Basic facts you should know about cryptocurrency: </p><p>The best-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which came into existence in January 2009 and marks the beginning of the rise of cryptocurrencies. But there were many unsuccessful attempts to create such currencies earlier. Cryptocurrency history is said to begin with the creation of Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, though no one knows whether that is a he or a she or even a group of people. <br>
There are now more than a thousand cryptocurrencies in use. They can be grouped into &ldquo;coins&rdquo; (Bitcoin plus other currencies collectively known as altcoins) and tokens, such as those used to pay for the services of a specific blockchain based platform. Altcoins offer varying levels of anonymity, transaction speed and other features. Also, the word &ldquo;coin&rdquo; is used as a metaphor, as there no coins on blockchain &#8211; it is only an entry in a ledger.</p><p>Questions like &ldquo;how does cryptocurrency work&rdquo; will be answered in several of our guides. Almost everything you need to know about Cryptocurrency is answered on our website. If you don&rsquo;t find the information you need &#8211; just let us know!</p><p><i>

Sure! You don&rsquo;t even need to be a programmer to create your own cryptocurrency. The open-source nature of the cryptoverse makes it a relatively easy task.</p><h2>How To Make Your Own Cryptocurrency</h2><p>Many existing blockchain platforms can help you to create your own cryptocurrency &ndash; as a community coin, a joke, an actual solution to a real-world problem, or for any other reason. You can easily issue your own coin or token via:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/eos/">EOS</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/waves/">Waves</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitshares/">BitShares</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/nem/">NEM</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/komodo/">Komodo</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/nxt/">Nxt</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tron/">TRON</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/iota/">IOTA</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/neo/">NEO</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/qtum/">Qtum</a></li></ul><p>If you don&rsquo;t want to be dependent on any of these platforms, or they don&rsquo;t offer the functionality you need, you can try to build your own blockchain from scratch.</p><p>Of course, the latter approach is much more complicated and requires in-depth training, code/programming skills, and a fundamental understanding of the technology.</p><h2>What Does It Take To Create A Cryptocurrency?</h2><p>In the case of the platforms, often not much. They make creating a cryptocurrency as easy as filling out a web form: just specify a name, how many coins you will need and a few other details, and there you have it &mdash; your own cryptocurrency!</p><p>You can find most open-source codes of existing blockchains on GitHub. After obtaining a code, you may also want to make changes to it to make sure it allows you to fulfill the purpose of your project.</p><p>Note that if you use an established blockchain, your coin is also more secure from the start and could benefit from additional built-in features.</p><p>If you wonder &lsquo;&rsquo;how to create my own cryptocurrency from scratch&rsquo;&rsquo;, it includes building a distributed ledger which demands a lot of work. However, it will also give you more freedom and control over your coin, ledger, and its features. You may also choose to fork one of the already existing open-source blockchain projects by changing some of its rules to fit your purpose.</p><p>Though, you should have in mind that forking a project doesn&rsquo;t copy its entire ecosystem and stakeholders along with the code. You will have to figure out the incentives and create a functioning ecosystem to make it all work. Most new cryptocurrencies are basically worthless, especially if there is no one else but you to verify the transactions.</p><h2>Companies That Can Create Crypto Currencies For You</h2><p>Growing demand for blockchain-based services has sparked the growth of firms and services that create and maintain distributed ledgers for others. Such businesses are called &#8220;<strong>blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS)</strong>&#8221; companies.</p><p>They offer various blockchain-oriented solutions for different business needs. Some of them can make a specialized blockchain for you, while others may propose their own infrastructure and related solutions.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="IBM blockchain as a service create cryptocurrency" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c9/9e9c49fd05.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c9/9e9c49fd05.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c9/9e9c49fd05.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c9/9e9c49fd05.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c9/9e9c49fd05.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c9/9e9c49fd05.png 1600w"></figure><p>IBM blockchain overview.

Maintaining a successful project is way harder than launching it. Maintenance may require further coding, teamwork, a network of computers, and investments in sales and marketing if you want your coin to become known and used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Previous &mdash; </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-do-cryptocurrencies-differ.htm"><i>How do cryptocurrencies differ?</i></a><br><i>Next &mdash; </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-an-ico.htm"><i>What is an ICO?</i></a></p><p><i>Have any suggestions about this entry? </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptonews.com/have-a-story.htm"><i>Let us know here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Issues one ought to consider before choosing an exchange include security, liquidity, fees, and user experience. For reviews of top exchanges, you can follow this link. Once you find an exchange that meets your basic requirements &ndash;&#8230;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c8/f918e6c1e2.png" alt="How to choose a cryptocurrency exchange" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c8/f918e6c1e2.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c8/f918e6c1e2.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c8/f918e6c1e2.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c8/f918e6c1e2.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c8/f918e6c1e2.png 1280w" sizes="100vw"></figure><p>Cryptocurrency exchanges let you buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Without access to a cryptocurrency exchange, you are unable to buy or sell digital assets. Though, there are some alternatives.</p><p>Even so, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that any cryptocurrency exchange is a good one. If you asked any seasoned crypto OG or trader to tell you a story about their first Bitcoin purchase, they are likely to tell you how they wasted significant amounts of money and time dealing with incompetent, buggy, or simply expensive exchanges at the beginning. It takes time to learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff, but you came to the right article.</p><p>This guide will show you how to choose the right cryptocurrency exchange for you right of the bat.</p><h2>What to consider when choosing a crypto exchange</h2><p>Before jumping into any random exchange someone recommended, you should consider many factors. The most important ones include exchange security, liquidity, fees, history, markets, and user experience. Finding the best cryptocurrency exchange for you can take some time and effort, but it is totally worth it.</p><p>One easy way to do it is by reading expert reviews. To see our reviews and comparisons of top exchanges <a href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/exchanges/">follow this link</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also important to distinguish crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat exchanges. The crypto-to-crypto exchanges list only cryptocurrency pairs, while fiat-to-crypto exchanges are let you buy and sell cryptocurrencies with dollars, euros, pounds, yen, and other currencies.</p><h2>How to pick the best cryptocurrency exchange?</h2><p>When choosing an exchange, keep in mind that your mileage may vary. You may want an exchange that supports specific altcoins, trading pairs, and additional features such as margin trading or over-the-counter (OTC) deals.</p><p>Once you find an exchange that meets your basic requirements, check these other aspects as well:</p><p><strong>Security:</strong></p><p>Security is by far the most important factor of an exchange. If an exchange is insecure, your funds could be stolen, leaving any other advantages it offers worthless. No one wants to lose his or her money, so In this respect, consider the following aspects.</p><p><strong>Technology:&nbsp;</strong><br>&mdash; The exchange&rsquo;s web address should start with HTTPS. Avoid HTTP connections.<br>&mdash; For login safety, it should use two-factor authentication (username and password plus a piece of information only you have).<br>&mdash; Customer deposits should be stored offline, in &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/bitcoin-cold-storage.htm">cold storage.</a>&rdquo;<br>&mdash; Auditing programs that monitor exchange activity 24/7 and SMS and email alerts all give exchange customers additional security guarantees.<br>&mdash; You may want to whitelist your IP address or withdrawal wallet addresses for the maximum security.</p><p><strong>Legal aspects:</strong><br>&mdash; It&rsquo;s recommended you use an exchange from the same country you are, as that can make it easier to comply with regulatory changes. It&rsquo;s also possible, though, to use other exchanges in other countries. Note that some exchanges support only a limited number of countries.<br>&mdash; Some exchanges may insure their funds, meaning that in case they lose your funds, you may be reimbursed.</p><p><strong>Transparency:</strong>&nbsp;<br>&mdash; Does the exchange reveal its owners, headquarter address, and the members of its team?&nbsp;<br>&mdash; Transparent exchanges also publish their cold storage address or help check their reserves in other ways, like audit information.</p><p>In any case, don&rsquo;t leave your funds on any cryptocurrency exchange longer than necessary. Keep only the funds you need for trading. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/why-it-is-risky-to-leave-your-cryptocurrency-in-exchange.htm">Most exchanges are like honeypots for hackers</a>. Since they must keep many digital assets in one place, hackers create the most elaborate schemes to steal exchange user&rsquo;s funds. Hence, it&rsquo;s better to store the rest of your bitcoin in your <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-store-cryptocurrency-safely.htm">private wallets</a>. (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-store-bitcoins.htm">You can also read more about Bitcoin wallets here</a>.)</p><p>Other important things to consider for when you are learning how to choose a crypto exchange are:</p><p><strong>Liquidity:&nbsp;</strong><br>The higher the trading volume is, the more liquid specific exchange is. Liquidity makes it possible to complete transactions faster, more easily and without having to deal with price volatility. Also, see whether an exchange offers &#8220;locked-in&#8221; pricing, which guarantees you the price at the time of your transaction even if it doesn&rsquo;t settle immediately.<br>Be aware that liquidity can be different for different trading pairs. It can be high for BTC/EUR, for example, but low for BTC/GBP. You can check the exchanges with the highest trading volumes here.</p><p><strong>Fees:</strong><br>&mdash; Compare all the fees an exchange charges. They&rsquo;re usually less than 1% per transaction and may decrease if your trading volume increases.<br>&mdash; Check the withdrawal fees. Some exchanges are known to offer unreasonably high withdrawal fees for specific altcoins.<br>&mdash; Look into deposit fees, too. Many exchanges offer a quick and convenient way to buy cryptocurrencies with a credit or debit card, but such purchases also come with <strong>a 5% or higher fee</strong>.</p><p><strong>User experience:</strong><br>&mdash; If you care about anonymity, you probably won&#8217;t choose an exchange that requires you to reveal much about your identity;<br>&mdash; Is the user interface simple and easy to use on both a desktop and a mobile device?<br>&mdash; What do other users say about the benefits and drawbacks of a specific exchange, the support it offers and so on? Check community forums like Bitcoin Reddit or Bitcoin Forum.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="how to choose bitcoin exchange" sizes="100vw" class=" lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c9/0b70cd5a0e.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/1/5c9/0b70cd5a0e.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/2/5c9/0b70cd5a0e.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/3/5c9/0b70cd5a0e.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/4/5c9/0b70cd5a0e.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/guides-attachments/0/5c9/0b70cd5a0e.jpg 1280w"></figure><p><strong>Recommended cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers</strong></p><p>Most exchanges differ from one another in the aspects mentioned above.

It lets you split your wallet recovery seed into multiple distributed shares and store them on secure, immutable, and damage-proof titanium hexagons. Although most crypto wallets do not yet support the SLIP39 standard, it is an excellent option for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trezor-model-t-review.htm">Trezor Model T</a> users as it is the first major wallet to support and popularize it.</p><p>Likewise, Cryptotag is the first recovery seed product designer to offer a dedicated product for Shamir backups. As such, Cryptotag Odin is a must-have for everyone who finds the Shamir backup scheme valuable and essential for their crypto security.</p><h2>Cryptotag Odin Review: Pros and Cons</h2><p>Cryptotag Odin is a premium wallet backup toolkit designed for wallets that use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir Secret Sharing</a> (SLIP39) seed recovery scheme. Although not as popular as the standard BIP39 recovery seed used by most wallets, SLIP39 lets you eliminate a single point of failure in your seed recovery process, and Cryptotag Odin is the tool that will keep your recovery sheets readable and intact even in the harshest physical conditions.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHGpChi4Wh8"></oembed></figure><p>Some of the key advantages of Cryptotag Odin include:</p><ul><li><strong>Extra security.</strong> If you find yourself thinking about how to improve your crypto security setup, adding an extra wallet or moving entirely to a Shamir backup scheme might be a great option. Add titanium hexagons into the mix, and you might finally grant yourself complete peace of mind.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Extreme durability.</strong> Much like its predecessors, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-review-the-best-way-to-backup-your-seed.htm">Cryptotag Thor</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-zeus-review.htm">Cryptotag Zeus</a> kits, Odin&#8217;s hexagons are made of high-grade titanium that is resistant to heat, water, and physical damage. It will make your Shamir backup shares capable of surviving even the most challenging physical conditions for lengthy periods.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Easy to set up.</strong> Odin uses a familiar setup process adapted for SLIP39 seeds. You&#8217;ll still have to sweat to punch holes into titanium, but the Cryptotag team made this process easier than it sounds. The duration of the setup procedure also depends on the number of secret shares in your Shamir setup.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Quick delivery.</strong> Cryptotag team pays special attention to its service design, which includes fast delivery service to most corners of the world. You can expect your package to arrive within 1 to 3 days after placing your order. More specific delivery times can be <a href="https://cryptotag.io/delivery-times-and-costs/">found here</a>.</li></ul><p>When it comes to the drawbacks of Odin, this is what comes to mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Most major wallets do not yet support SLIP39.</strong> While Cryptotag Odin is designed explicitly with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trezor-model-t-review.htm"><u>Trezor Model T</u></a> hardware wallet in mind, it is also compatible with other SLIP39 supporting wallets. Cryptotag also has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-zeus-review.htm"><u>Zeus</u></a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-review-the-best-way-to-backup-your-seed.htm"><u>Thor</u></a> backup options for most if not all BIP39-based wallets.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Each Odin hexagon is limited to 20 words.</strong> While some of the Shamir Secret Sharing wallets let you choose to generate 33 words per share instead of 20, it&#8217;s worth keeping in mind that you&#8217;ll only be able to store 20 words per share with Cryptotag Odin.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Criticisms of Shamir Secret Sharing</strong>. Some security experts claim that <a href="https://blog.keys.casa/shamirs-secret-sharing-security-shortcomings/"><u>Shamir Secret Sharing introduces its own shortcomings</u></a> into crypto security setups, while others <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/protecting-bitcoin-shamir-backup"><u>highlight its benefits.</u></a> Despite these differences in opinion, it is generally accepted that each crypto security scheme has its strengths and weaknesses. You should choose the option that fits your personal needs, wishes, and circumstances best.</li></ul><h2>What Is Shamir Backup?</h2><p>In very simplified terms, Shamir backup can be deemed as a multi-signature scheme for your recovery seed. It splits your recovery seed into multiple seed shares that can later be used to recover your crypto wallet in case of its loss or device failure. But that&#8217;s not the best part.</p><p>Unlike BIP39 wallets, which require you to have the exact amount of recovery words in a particular order, SLIP39 lets you recover your entire wallet using a predetermined threshold of shares, meaning that you don&#8217;t have to have all of your shares for full wallet recovery.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, Shamir backups let you create:</p><ul><li>3 seed shares with a recovery threshold of 2</li><li>5 seed shares with a recovery threshold of 3</li><li>7 seed shares with a recovery threshold of 4</li><li>Multiple other variations</li></ul><p>The maximum number of seed shares is 16, while the recovery threshold can be set to anything from 1 to 16.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1415" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/shamir-benefits.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_1415_1116.jpg 1415w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_1200_946.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_900_709.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_720_567.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_600_473.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/guide/79881/200622/responsive-images/shamir-benefits___media_library_original_300_236.jpg 300w"><figcaption>Source: Trezor.io</figcaption></figure><p>Such a method leaves extra room for error in case you lose access to certain parts of your recovery setup due to an accident or theft.</p><p>Here is a brief Shamir backup video <a href="https://wiki.trezor.io/Shamir_Backup">explainer by Trezor</a>:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRh-NCvHkzM"></oembed></figure><h2>What&#8217;s In The Box?</h2><p>You can order three variations of Cryptotag Odin &#8211; Odin 3, Odin 5, and Odin 7. The only two differences between these packages are the number of titanium hexagons you&#8217;ll receive for your setup and their price.</p><p>Other than that, Cryptotag Odin shipment includes:</p><ul><li>3, 5, or 7 titanium hexagons</li><li>3, 5, or 7 silicon sleeves for hexagons</li><li>Center punch toolkit</li><li>Cryptotag matches</li><li>Earplugs</li><li>A setup guide</li><li>Conversion sheets (paper)</li><li>SLIP39 word list</li></ul><h4>Package specifications</h4><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Odin 3</strong></td><td><strong>Odin 5</strong></td><td><strong>Odin 7</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Packgage dimensions</strong></td><td>16.5 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 6.5 x 5.1 x 3.5 in</td><td>19.4 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 7.6 x 5.1 x 3.5 in</td><td>25.4 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 10 x 5.1 x 25 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Packgade weight</strong></td><td>1 kg / 35.2 oz</td><td>1.5 kg / 53 oz</td><td>2 kg / 71 oz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of hexagons</strong></td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage capacity</strong></td><td>20 words per hexagon</td><td>20 words per hexagon</td><td>20 words per hexagon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lenght</strong></td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Width</strong></td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heat resistance</strong></td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Design and Durability</h2><p>Unlike its predecessors Cryptotag Thor and Zeus, Cryptotag Odin is a unique hexagon shape. Each hexagon can store up to 20 SLIP39 words. However, you&#8217;re not going to store SLIP39 words directly on the hexagon &#8211; you&#8217;ll be using their corresponding list numbers instead.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://cryptotag.io/slip-39-wordlist/"><u>The SLIP39 word list</u></a> contains a total of 1024 words (unlike the <a href="https://cryptotag.io/bip39-list/"><u>BIP39 word list</u></a>, which uses 2048 words), each of which has its order in the sequence. For example, the alphabetical list starts with the word &#8216;abandon,&#8217; meaning that its corresponding number is 0001. Meanwhile, the last word in the list, &#8216;zoo,&#8217; can be easily replaced with the number 1024 and vice versa.</p><p>As a result, instead of punching in the entire world, all you have to do is punch in a corresponding four-digit number of the word. According to Cryptotag, using numbers instead of words is an easier and more reliable way to store recovery seed information into a titanium plate.&nbsp;</p><p>A complete list of all SLIP39 words and their corresponding numbers that are punched on the hexagon and also can be found on <a href="https://cryptotag.io/slip-39-wordlist/"><u>the official Cryptotag website</u></a>. Alternatively, Cryptotag dispatches a printed version of the SLIP39 word list for each Odin package.</p><p>When it comes to Odin&#8217;s durability, it remains one of the most robust backup products out there. It is made of high-grade titanium that is resistant to water damage, rust, heat (up to 1665&deg;C or 3029 &deg;F), and all sorts of physical damage. <a href="https://cryptotag.io/testing-facility/">According to Cryptotag&#8217;s testing facility</a>, it has been tested with:</p><ul><li>Blocktorch</li><li>Blacksmith fire</li><li>Open fire</li><li>Closed fire</li><li>Pneumatic hammer</li><li>Profile bending</li><li>Metal roller</li><li>High-pressure</li><li>Beretta 9MM (shooting distance 10m)</li><li>Glock 9 MM (shooting distance 10m)</li><li>CZ Scorpion SMG (shooting distance 10m)</li></ul><p>As such, you&#8217;re virtually guaranteed to receive one of the highest grade cool storage tools available on the market today.</p><h2>Compatible Wallets</h2><p>Cryptotag Odin goes hand in hand with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/trezor-model-t-review.htm">Trezor Model T</a> hardware wallet, which was the first major wallet to support the SLIP39 format.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, it is also usable with other SLIP39 supporting software and hardware wallets, namely:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Keystone</li><li>Hermit</li><li>Electrum</li><li>Bluewallet</li></ul><p>Some SLIP39 supporting wallets allow its users to select the number of recovery words required per share &#8211; either a 33-word or 20-word recovery sheets. Keep in mind that each of Odin&#8217;s shares can store up to 20 words only, so shares that exceed this limit are incompatible with Cryptotag Odin.</p><h2>Setting Up a Shamir Backup Wallet</h2><p>Creating a Shamir backup on your compatible wallet is much like making a regular BIP39 setup, except that you have to write down more seed words, select a number of shares, and their corresponding threshold.</p><p>For instance, here is a short video guide by Trezor on how to create a Shamir backup:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7WkAN0Gac4"></oembed></figure><p>In case you&#8217;d like to get further guidance on how to create a secure Shamir backup with your Trezor Model T, here is a detailed video explainer by Vlad Costea from <a href="https://bitcoin-takeover.com/"><u>BitcoinTakeover.com</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB289NG2bcM"></oembed></figure><h2>How To Set Up Cryptotag Odin Backup?</h2><p>Setting up Cryptotag Odin is not so different from its BIP39 counterparts. You can upgrade your Shamir backup scheme from paper to titanium in six simple steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Get your recovery words.</strong> Bring all of your Shamir backup recovery sheets to a single place or set up a new Shamir wallet with a desired number of shares and write down their words (see the previous paragraph).<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Convert your recovery words into their corresponding numbers.</strong> You can find them in a provided SLIP39 word list that came with your Odin package. Alternatively, you can find the digital version of the list on <u>Cryptotag&#8217;s</u><a href="https://cryptotag.io/slip-39-wordlist/"><u> website.</u></a>&nbsp;<br><br><i><strong>Important:</strong> if you&#8217;re using a digital version of the wordlist, do not type in or mark your seed words on your browser or other search mechanisms &#8211; it might introduce an additional attack vector in case your computer is compromised. It&#8217;s safer to use the analog version if possible in order to minimize risks.</i><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Punch the numbers onto the titanium hexagons</strong> just as they appear on your paper recovery sheets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Burn your paper recovery sheets</strong> as keeping additional paper copies may only introduce additional attack vectors. You can use Cryptotag&rsquo;s dedicated matches for a full Cryptotag experience.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Distribute and hide your titanium hexagons.</strong> Here you have it &#8211; your own secure Shamir backup. Take care and keep it safe!</li></ol><p>In case this wasn&#8217;tCryptotag&#8217;sCryptotag&#8217;s sufficiently clear, here is an original 5-minute setup instruction video by Cryptotag:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY38fn2iD6Q"></oembed></figure><h2>Cryptotag Odin vs Cryptotag Zeus vs Cryptotag Thor</h2><p>Cryptotag Odin is a backup tool dedicated specifically to Shamir SLIP-39 backup schemes. Meanwhile, Cryptotag Thor and Zeus toolkits are designed for BIP-39 seed phrase storage, and the sole difference between the two titanium plates is the price and the number of wallets and seed words than can be stored via each kit.</p><p>You can read our full reviews of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-review-the-best-way-to-backup-your-seed.htm">Cryptotag Thor</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/cryptotag-zeus-review.htm">Cryptotag Zeus</a> here.</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Zeus</strong></td><td><strong>Thor</strong></td><td><strong>Odin 3, 5 &amp; 7</strong></td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Price</strong></i></td><td>EUR 129</td><td>EUR 350</td><td>EUR 199 &#8211; EUR 359</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Type of seed</strong></i></td><td>BIP39</td><td>BIP39</td><td>SLIP39</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Number of seed words stored</strong></i></td><td>24 seed words</td><td>48 seed words</td><td>20 words per share</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Max number of wallets stored</strong></i></td><td>1-2 wallets</td><td>2-4 wallets</td><td>1 wallet</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Compatible wallets</strong></i></td><td>Ledger, Trezor, Metamask and most other wallets</td><td>Ledger, Trezor, Metamask and most other wallets</td><td>Trezor Model T, Bluewallet, Electrum, Hermit and some others</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Setup time</strong></i></td><td>~ 5 minutes</td><td>~ 15 minutes</td><td>~ 10 &#8211; 30 minutes based on your number of shares</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Material</strong></i></td><td>Titanium</td><td>Titanium</td><td>Titanium</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Lenght</strong></i></td><td>11.3 cm / 4.4 in</td><td>11.3 cm / 4.4 in</td><td>12 cm / 4.7 in</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Width</strong></i></td><td>6.8 cm / 2.67 in</td><td>6.8 cm / 2.67 in</td><td>2.5 cm / 0.98 in</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Thickness</strong></i></td><td>0.6 cm / 0.23 in</td><td>0.6 cm / 0.23 in</td><td>2.2 cm / 0.87 in</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Weight</strong></i></td><td>210 grams / 7.4 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td><td>186 grams / 6.6 oz</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Heat ressistance</strong></i></td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td><td>1667 &deg;C / 3032 &deg;F</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Box weight</strong></i></td><td>410 grams / 14.1 oz</td><td>3.6 kg / 7.9 lb</td><td>1 -2 kg / 35 &#8211; 71 oz</td></tr><tr><td><i><strong>Box dimensions</strong></i></td><td>14.5 x 12 x 3 cm /&nbsp;<br>5.7 x 4.7 x 1.2 in</td><td>35 x 26 x 9 cm /<br>14 x 10 x 3.5 in</td><td>16.5-&nbsp; 25.4 x 13 x 8.8 cm / 6.5 &#8211; 10 x 5.1 x 25 in</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Cryptotag Odin Review: Conclusion</h2><p>Cyptotag Odin is the best Shamir backup option on the market today and is an excellent addition to Cryptotag&rsquo;s repertoire of quality backup products. If you&rsquo;re using or thinking of using Shamir recovery seed backup, upgrading your paper seeds into titanium hexagons is a no brainer.</p>

This is why many newcomers to the industry wonder if they should speculate or invest in BTC or ETH for the long term.&nbsp;</p><p>However, their respective growth charts are far from the only thing that should be considered when making this type of decision. In this guide, we will go through the main differences between ETH and BTC, their roles as investment vehicles, as well as their respective values.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Main Differences</h3><p>Although both projects are based on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain</a> and their coins are used as cryptocurrencies, they are fundamentally different.</p><p>Bitcoin was initially created by a mysterious pseudonym <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> as an aspiring alternative to centrally-issued and managed fiat currencies. Its main selling point is that it is not backed by any central bank or other financial institution but by a decentralized network of computers and nodes who verify the rules of a secure, transparent, and immutable blockchain. These things make it possible for bitcoins to be safe to use, verify ownership and hold while avoiding common pitfalls when it comes to network attacks, currency debasement, and double-spending. Additionally, Bitcoin introduces a native privacy-friendly final settlement, payment, and store-of-value system to the internet, where users would otherwise have to use payment options that can identify and censor them immediately; this amount of privacy was heretofore seen only with the use of cash.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/difference-of-bitcoin-from-traditional-currencies.htm"><i>Read more: The Difference Between Bitcoin and Traditional Currencies</i></a>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Ethereum goes beyond offering a currency option based on blockchain. The idea for Ethereum was born when <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a>, one of its co-founders, realized the possibilities of Bitcoin if it was programmable.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Ethereum enables the deployment of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a> and decentralized applications (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dapps/">dapps</a>) to be built and run without any interference from third parties. The basics upon which the trustworthiness of Bitcoin was founded are also used to lend significant credibility to the Ethereum network as well as competing blockchain platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>While <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">ether</a>, Ethereum&rsquo;s native currency, can also be used as a store of value and a payment option, its primary use is powering the network. It is used to pay gas fees, deploy smart contracts, as a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-stake-eth-for-ethereum-2-0.htm">staking option</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-mint-and-create-an-nft.htm">mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, the main differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, as projects, can be summed up in the following points:</p><ul><li><strong>Store of value: </strong>bitcoins are designed to be, primarily, a store of value, while ether is not.</li><li><strong>Programmability:</strong> Bitcoin is not a programmable platform; it can only do what it is designed to do, while Ethereum can host a myriad of projects as well as other blockchains.</li><li><strong>Block time: </strong>interestingly, Bitcoin&mdash;which is supposed to act as an alternative to traditional payment systems&mdash;is significantly slower than Ethereum, for security purposes.</li><li><strong>Market cap: </strong>at the time of writing (October 2021), bitcoin has a market cap of USD 1trn, while ether&rsquo;s is USD 407bn&mdash;meaning bitcoin&rsquo;s worth is more than double that of ether.</li></ul><p>While this list of differences is far from exhaustive, it offers a high level overview of the two projects and their respective goals.</p><h3>Why Ethereum and Bitcoin Are Very Different Investments</h3><p>In spite of the aforementioned differences between the two projects, many laymen tend to cast ether as the replacement for bitcoin. This can add confusion to an already complex space, which means newcomers tend to misunderstand the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold. It is a scarce asset, as there can only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in circulation (at the time of writing, there were around 18.8m BTC in circulation). This makes it deflationary, which serves to increase its value over time. Another factor in its deflationary nature is the fact that some people, often early adopters, will inevitably lose their private keys, which locks them out of their BTC holdings forever. On the other hand, a deflationary currency could theoretically become too valuable to use. However, Bitcoin addresses this as well: it is infinitely divisible, so people will just use smaller units, like satoshis, to get around this.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/will-bitcoin-ever-be-stable.htm"><i>Learn more: Will Bitcoin Ever Be Stable?</i></a></p><p>On the other hand, ether&rsquo;s use case within its own ecosystem&mdash;that is, outside of treating it as a store of value, like with bitcoins&mdash;means that the coin is not treated like a digital commodity in the same sense. Still, in order to improve its usability and simplify the fee-paying process of the network, a new upgrade on Ethereum has started burning the coins that were used to pay fees with. This is going to lessen Ethereum&rsquo;s inflation level (currently at around 4%), potentially even making it deflationary as time goes on. However, Ethereum does not have a hard cap on its coins like Bitcoin does, which means it is not deflationary by design.</p><p>This means that, while bitcoin&rsquo;s deflationary nature is a key piece of its design that is supposed to make it more valuable, ether&rsquo;s value does not lie here, but in its usability and applicability. Ether being used as a store of value and payment option is secondary to its true use case. When deciding which investment to make, it is important to be able to tell these two apart through their specific applications.</p><h3>Is Ethereum More Valuable Than Bitcoin?</h3><p>This question arises often, even with the coins reversed. However, it&rsquo;s not surprising, as the two coins are often shown as rivals: in terms of price and market cap, ETH is the biggest competitor that BTC has in its market domination. On the other hand, our guide up until now has shown that the two are not necessarily comparable in all aspects, so the equivalences that are so often made tend to be false.</p><p>Therefore, the value of each depends on what the investor deems valuable. In the broadest strokes, BTC has a significantly higher market cap than ETH, making it more than double the worth of ETH.</p><p>Another common talking point is intrinsic value. This is a measure of the worth of an asset, derived not from its current price, but through complex financial models and calculations. Among numerous other applications, it is meant to establish the worth of an asset and whether it is overvalued or undervalued, which in turn can offer some useful pointers as to the asset&rsquo;s future.</p><p>There is an important caveat here, however: currencies, as a rule, have no intrinsic value and this goes for bitcoin and ether as well. They&rsquo;re not backed by any physical assets (neither are fiat currencies, which are instead backed by the state and their value is derived from the people&rsquo;s trust in their government). Therefore, self-proclaimed analysts that rate cryptocurrencies on their perceived &ldquo;intrinsic value&rdquo; (or lack thereof) should not be taken seriously.</p><p>Finally, it comes down to what each of the assets represents, and where a prospective investor&rsquo;s priorities lie. This is what we will cover in the next section.</p><h3>Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum: Which Is A Better Buy</h3><p>When deciding between investing in ETH or BTC, the first thing you need to determine is which of the investments appeals more to you and your personal beliefs.</p><p>Do you prefer a commodity, which you can either use as a payment system, a store of value, or a speculative investment&mdash;or even all three at once? In this case, your best bet is buying bitcoin through a trusted online broker. This enables you to spend your BTC wherever you want (and where it is accepted), send it to other wallets, or simply hold it.</p><p>However, if your main goal is to profit off the volatility of cryptocurrencies, you are not required to buy BTC directly. Nowadays, depending on your region, many brokers offer different types of BTC derivatives. Sometimes called synthetic products, they let you wager on the price of bitcoin without holding the asset directly, which could slow you down when you need to make split-second decisions. Recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-bitcoin-futures-etf.htm">approved</a> the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), which means that investors from the States now have the opportunity to gain exposure to the price of bitcoin without having to buy and securely store the most popular cryptocurrency themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, bitcoin derivatives&mdash;like any other crypto derivative&mdash;cannot be spent or sent on-chain. This means that, if you would like the option of using crypto to pay for something privately and securely, you will still need to hold the actual asset.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin.htm"><i>Read more: How to Invest in Bitcoin?</i></a></p><p>Choosing to buy ether is based on a similar decision. Would you rather go for a coin that has an applied use case within a growing ecosystem that serves as the basis for decentralized finance (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/">DeFi</a>)? This is especially worth noting if you&rsquo;re interested in participating in Ethereum&rsquo;s vast, sprawling ecosystem in any way.&nbsp;</p><p>Ether offers the same possibility as bitcoin in terms of derivatives trading. However, there are currently no ETH ETFs approved for trading in the US, although there are a number of asset managers who have filed for it. In other jurisdictions, it is possible to trade different types of derivatives&mdash;just be sure to check which ones are supported in your area, and where they stand legally. Some regions have outlawed some types of derivatives, so you should always do your own research first.</p><h3>Why Is Ethereum Rising Faster Than Bitcoin</h3><p>For a period of time during August and September 2021, the price of bitcoin and ether was both on the rise, but ether seemed to be rising much faster than bitcoin, relative to size. That trend has slowed down since (as of October 2021). It must be said, however, that the price of bitcoin and ether is very rarely correlated, and that the appreciation of one does not imply its superiority, or any other type of relationship, compared to the other.</p><p>More specifically, at the time of this trend, Ethereum was undergoing a series of updates that were designed to take it down an important road towards a different consensus. The new business model would make Ethereum cheaper to use, faster, more scalable, and overall more friendly towards newcomers with less technical knowledge than before.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum-2-0.htm"><i>Learn more: What Is Ethereum 2.0?</i></a></p><p>Migrating such a huge platform from one approach to another, especially with the pressure of keeping it fully decentralized and secure at all times, is no small feat. The Ethereum 2.0 ascent sets a precedent for the whole crypto community, showing that change&mdash;although slow and laborious&mdash;can still happen even in the world of rigid, immutable blockchains. The crypto community is largely aware of this, and this has generated incredible hype that quickly spread outside the borders of the industry. Ethereum has garnered a lot of institutional interest as well, which could have further contributed to its rapid rise in price.</p><p>Still, it is hard to pinpoint all the exact reasons why an asset&rsquo;s price could have moved at a specific time, especially when it comes to assets with large caps like ether, or even bitcoin. These price movements always depend on innumerable factors, most of which occur behind the scenes and out of the public eye. This is why it is important to always do your own research, weigh the risks, pros and cons of investing in something, and stay diligent in tracking your investments. Finally, the most important advice is never to invest more than you can afford to lose.</p><h3>Finishing Thoughts</h3><p>The purpose of this guide was to highlight the different ways in which bitcoin and ether could be good investments for you, depending on your personal preferences in terms of size, applicability, volatility, and other factors. In that sense, neither of these is the better investment by itself. However, after this guide, you should be able to decide which one is the better fit for you.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re still unsure, you can find more information about each coin on our dedicated coin pages for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>.
