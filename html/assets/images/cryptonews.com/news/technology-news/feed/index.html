By leveraging artificial intelligence, CoinMarketCap is offering a tool that could democratize access to detailed crypto analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>It allows for a wider range of participants in the crypto market, from seasoned traders to newcomers, to make data-driven decisions without the steep learning curve traditionally associated with crypto trading and investment.&nbsp;</p>

AI instances can spend several days befriending someone, usually an elderly or vulnerable person, only to end up scamming them.&nbsp;</p>

The video contained footage of Musk from past interviews, manipulated to fit the fraudulent scheme.</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yikes.

A fleet of self-driving cars can be programmed to travel in the most efficient way possible, avoiding traffic jams, and waiting times.&nbsp;</p><p>By reducing traffic congestion, Robotaxis can help alleviate the issues of air pollution and environmental degradation caused by long idling times in congested traffic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Specifically, the tech giant has shown great interest in the metaverse.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Microsoft has recently&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microsoft-pulls-plug-industrial-metaverse-team-heres-what-happened.htm">discontinued</a>&nbsp;its Industrial Metaverse Core team, a four-month-old project aimed to encourage the use of the metaverse in industrial environments. The company also laid off employees working on the project, which amounts to about 100 people.</p><h2>More Browsers Offer Crypto Wallets as Adoption Grows</h2><p>Microsoft Edge is not the first web browser to include a crypto wallet. A number of other major web browsers have recently added support for built-in crypto wallets as adoption grows.&nbsp;</p><p>Opera has been supporting cryptocurrency since 2018, initially adding the feature on mobile before extending it to the desktop in 2019. More recently, the browser&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/as-opera-challenges-brave-browser-with-push-further-into-crypto-how-do-they-compare.htm">strengthened</a>&nbsp;its push into crypto by adding browser wallet support for multiple new blockchain networks, including Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Ronin (RON).</p><p>Similarly, Brave has had its own crypto wallet known as the Brave Wallet built into it since November 2021. The wallet supports all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains and Ethereum Layer 2 chains with both standard ERC-20 tokens and NFTs on the ERC-721 standard.</p><p>In January last year, the browser said it had&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/privacy-focused-browser-brave-hits-50m-monthly-active-users.htm">passed 50 million</a>&nbsp;monthly active users, with more than 8 million users actively earning rewards in the form of BAT tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>This puts Brave well behind Opera in terms of overall popularity, but given that the browser only launched in 2017, user growth has undeniably been strong in recent years.</p><p>Meanwhile, users of other browsers like Mozilla, Firefox, and Google Chrome can install third-party cryptocurrency wallets such as Metamask to be able to use Web3 applications.&nbsp;</p>

Oncyber supports accessing NFTs from different wallets and different chains such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and more.</p><p>A teaser video shows that with a line of text dropped into the Magic Composer, Oncyber can automatically change the look and color of the sky, drop in an artist&rsquo;s NFT works from your connected crypto wallet, customize the look and size of picture frames in the world, and more.&nbsp;</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing a GPT-powered AI tool for text to world building <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br><br>here’s a sneak peek, where your creativity can flow from your brain to web3D. <br><br>stay tuned for public access — notifs on <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1fae1.png" alt="🫡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, <br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f53d.png" alt="🔽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for early access <a href="https://t.co/0GzkpYoMBC">pic.twitter.com/0GzkpYoMBC</a></p>&mdash; ᴏɴᴄʏʙᴇʀ (@oncyber) <a href="https://twitter.com/oncyber/status/1636149910629421056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>In a recent interview, Oncyber founder and CEO Rayan Boutaleb&nbsp;<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/openai-gpt-helping-turn-text-215959415.html">said</a>&nbsp;that this is merely the first version of the tool. Boutaleb claimed that the next iterations of the tool would give artists additional power to turn their dreams into a 3D canvas. He said:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the next iteration, what we want is for people to port any hallucination or dream they have into a 3D canvas, and just directly see the result of what they might imagine and change things up. It&rsquo;s a first step towards a very big end result, which we are not that far off from.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Boutaleb claimed that they adopted AI technologies to find another way to help users unlock their creativity on the platform. There&rsquo;s a disconnect between the power of Oncyber&rsquo;s game-like engine and the visual user interface, he added.&nbsp;</p><p>More robust AI functionality is on the horizon, too. Boutaleb said that in time, he hopes to add more complex generative features, such as the ability to generate bespoke or modified 3D architecture simply by typing out a request. Over time, Oncyber&rsquo;s goal is to have &ldquo;less and less boundaries/limits&rdquo; for users, he added.</p><p>In a recent tweet, Oncyber asked interested users to join the waitlist for a beta experience and start testing the product as soon as Monday, March 20. However, Boutaleb said it won&rsquo;t be long before Magic Composer reaches public users.</p><h2>Crypto Projects Integrate AI to Enhance User Experience</h2><p>Aside from Oncyber, a number of other crypto and Web3 projects have integrated AI technologies into their services and products in a bid to enhance user experience.</p><p>As reported,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-ai-projects-are-rise-but-how-long-can-they-last-learn-why-metropoly-better-investment.htm">AI-powered</a>&nbsp;Web3-focused search engine Kaito&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chatgpt-is-helping-this-new-project-take-crypto-search-to-the-next-level-a-game-changer-for-the-industry.htm">raised $5.3 million</a>&nbsp;in a seed fundraising round earlier this year in a bid to increase the size of the team and speed up product development.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, US exchange PayBito has announced its intentions to integrate ChatGPT to improve its market analysis, fully identify its future trends, and open up even more to new trading opportunities.</p><p>&ldquo;The integration of ChatGPT will add value and improve the user experience. The artificial intelligence-based tool will enable traders to make informed decisions with accurate information,&#8221; Raj Chowdhury, CEO of PayBito, said at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Together, they&rsquo;ll be able to collaborate on new projects and make money in ways not previously possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>He specifically mentioned that creators can use NFT to give a verifiable way for fans to own unique videos, photos, art, and even experiences. However, Mohan insisted that they need to approach these new technologies &#8220;responsibly.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;And across all these formats, you&rsquo;ll see even more ways to help creators make money and build a business,&#8221; he added, noting that new technologies like NFTs could open up new streams of revenue not only for creators but also for fans and viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>Mohan also touched on the subject of the metaverse, claiming that they are &#8220;thinking big&#8221; about how to make viewing more immersive. He noted that this will likely first impact gaming, where they would try to bring more interactions to games and make them feel more alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, Wojcicki stepped down from YouTube after nine years at the helm, outlining plans to start a &ldquo;new chapter&rdquo; focused on family, health, and personal projects. During her tenure, she oversaw the pivotal introduction of the revenue-sharing model, among other things.</p><p>A Stanford graduate, Mohan joined Google in 2008 as its chief product officer at YouTube. He was involved with some of the biggest developments and changes in the platform, including YouTube Shorts and Music.</p><p>YouTube&#8217;s sister company Google has also made a foray into the world of cryptocurrencies and Web3. Last year, the company&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/google-cloud-enter-blockchain-node-world-with-new-service.htm">announced</a>&nbsp;the launch of a cloud-based service for Ethereum projects and developers called the Blockchain Node Engine.&nbsp;</p><p>While Ethereum became the first blockchain to be supported by Blockchain Node Engine, the tech giant revealed the following month that it would expand its Blockchain Node Engine to the Solana Blockchain as well, a feature set to launch in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>Furthermore, Google&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-news-summary-coinbase-partners-with-google-cloud-for-crypto-payments-cnn-kills-vault.htm">partnered</a>&nbsp;with Coinbase to allow users to pay for cloud services using crypto. A select number of customers would be able to pay for its Cloud services using cryptoassets such as Bitcoin starting this year.&nbsp;</p>

The malware also inflates the victim&#8217;s device and executes the payload, which is either the GO variant of Laplas Clipper malware or MortalKombat ransomware.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;The loader script will run the dropped payload as a process in the victim&rsquo;s machine, then delete the downloaded and dropped malicious files to clean up the infection markers,&#8221; the report detailed.&nbsp;</p><p>Talos noted that a usual vector of attack for the criminals has been a phishing email in which they impersonate CoinPayments, a legitimate global cryptocurrency payment gateway.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the emails look even more legitimate, they have a spoofed sender, &ldquo;noreply[at]CoinPayments[.]net&rdquo;, and the email subject &ldquo;[CoinPayments[.]net] Payment Timed Out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>On this specific occasion, a malicious ZIP file is attached with a filename resembling a transaction ID mentioned in the email body, which allures the victim to unzip the malicious attachment in order to view the contents, which is a malicious BAT loader.</p><h2>Ransomware Threats Rise while Revenue Declines</h2><p>Ransomware and cybersecurity attacks continue to increase. However, victims have been increasingly unwilling to pay attackers their demands, according to a recent report by Chainalysis, which revealed that ransomware revenues for attackers plummeted 40% last year.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that North Korean hacking groups account for a huge portion of illicit cyber activities. Just recently, South Korean and United States intelligence agencies&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-north-korean-ransomware-threat-major-institutions-detected-say-south-korea-us.htm">warned</a>&nbsp;that Pyongyang-based hackers are trying to hit &ldquo;major international institutions&rdquo; with ransomware attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>In December 2022, Kaspersky also&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kaspersky-report-north-korean-hackers-impersonating-crypto-vcs-new-phishing-scam.htm">revealed</a>&nbsp;that BlueNoroff, a subgroup of the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus, is impersonating venture capitalists looking to invest in crypto startups in a new phishing method.&nbsp;</p>
