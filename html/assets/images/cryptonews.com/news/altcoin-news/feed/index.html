<p>Digital asset investment funds saw a record $326 million in net outflows last week, marking the largest single week of inflows since July 2022.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-155-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-c509d7ea4610" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent report by CoinShares</span></a>, the surge in investor interest can be attributed to growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>&#8220;Month-to-date inflows are now close to half a billion dollars,&#8221; the report said, noting that this indicates an increase in investor confidence.</p>
<p>While the weekly inflow is undoubtedly positive for Bitcoin, it is worth noting that it ranks as only the 21st largest on record, suggesting that investors are still exercising caution.</p>
<p>However, industry experts believe that the approval of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF in the coming months is highly likely.</p>
<p>Such an approval would represent a significant regulatory milestone for the industry and potentially drive further investment.</p>
<p>Regionally, the United States accounted for only 12% of the inflows, with $38 million, as investors eagerly await the potential launch of the spot-based ETF.</p>
<p>The major contributors to the inflows were Canada, Germany, and Switzerland, with inflows of $134 million, $82 million, and $50 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Asia also witnessed a surge in weekly inflows, reaching $28 million.</p>
<p>With total assets under management now standing at $37.8 billion, the highest since May 2022, the digital asset market is experiencing substantial growth.
</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Dominates Weekly Inflows</h2>
<p>
Bitcoin dominated the inflows, capturing 90% of the total at $296 million.</p>
<p>However, the recent price surge also prompted $15 million in inflows into short-Bitcoin investment products, reflecting the hedging strategies employed by some investors.</p>
<p>In addition to Bitcoin, Solana experienced significant inflows of $24 million.</p>
<p>Although some other altcoins also saw inflows, this wave of optimism did not extend to Ethereum, which experienced outflows totaling $6 million.</p>
<p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-cantor-fitzgerald-grows-confident-heres-why.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">anticipation of a spot ETF approval</span></a> has led to a surge in Bitcoin&rsquo;s price in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency rallied towards $35,000 earlier this month, driven by market speculation surrounding the potential approval of a spot ETF.</p>
<p>The surge in price has not only caught the attention of investors but has also sparked a renewed interest in crypto trading, leading to a significant increase in daily exchange volumes.</p>
<p>As <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoins-climb-to-35000-fuels-surge-in-crypto-trading-activity-is-the-bull-market-starting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a>, the seven-day moving average for spot exchange volumes across reputable platforms breached an impressive $24 billion on October 26, a level not seen since the end of March.</p>

<p>The <strong>Celestia </strong>mainnet, the first modular data availability network, is set to launch tomorrow (<strong>14:00 on October 31 UTC</strong>). This will also release its native token TIA for trading with an airdrop of <a href="https://blog.celestia.org/genesis-drop/">60 million</a> tokens, 6% of the tokens in circulation, for active users on Ethereum Layer 2s Cosmos Hub, and Osmosis, making it one of the biggest airdrops seen in 2023.</p>
<p>The snapshot of the airdrop was taken on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The Block <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/259970/celestia-mainnet-tia-token">confirmed</a> the Celestia network&rsquo;s launch date and time, as Celestia&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/milestones">GitHub</a> repository also indicated its launch timeline.</p>

<p>Celestia introduces a unique approach by solely focusing on arranging and sharing transactions, unlike conventional networks that also execute these transactions. This distinctive feature creates a division between the consensus on transactions and their actual execution.</p>
<p>By redesigning the fundamental architecture of blockchain, Celestia aims to reduce the cost of developing decentralized applications. Thus, the simplified framework presents a more accessible and cost-effective platform for innovators in the industry.</p>
<p>The network also anticipates community-generated content post Celestia&rsquo;s launch. The additional features and improvements that may come include support for pruning historical blob data to reduce node storage requirements, a &ldquo;partial node&rdquo; type for light nodes that verify the Celestia L1 state transitions, and the Blobstream deployment to Ethereum Mainnet for Layer 2s to use Celestia.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Celestia Labs raised $55 million in a funding round led by Bain Capital Crypto and Polychain Capital.</p>

<p>Singapore&#8217;s central bank has announced plans to collaborate with monetary authorities in Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom for joint digital asset pilots.</p>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-policymakers-to-foster-responsible-digital-asset-innovation#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Monday press release</span></a>, the <strong>Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)</strong> announced that it will collaborate with the <strong>Financial Services Agency of Japan (FSA)</strong>, the <strong>Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA)</strong>, and the <strong>United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</strong> to promote joint crypto ventures.</p>
<p>The primary focus of these pilots will revolve around fixed income, foreign exchange, and asset management products.</p>
<p>The initiative builds upon Singapore&#8217;s ongoing asset tokenization project, known as Project Guardian, which was launched in 2022.</p>
<p>Under Project Guardian, MAS collaborated with 15 financial institutions to conduct pilots on asset tokenization, demonstrating significant potential for transaction efficiency.</p>
<p>Recognizing the need for closer cross-border collaboration among policymakers and regulators as these pilots grow in scale and sophistication, MAS has established a Project Guardian policymaker group comprising the FSA, FCA, and FINMA.</p>
<p>The group aims to facilitate policy and accounting discussions, identify potential risks and legal gaps related to digital assets and tokenized solutions, and explore the development of common standards for digital asset networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;MAS&rsquo; partnership with FSA, FCA and FINMA shows a strong desire among policymakers to deepen our understanding of the opportunities and risks arising from digital asset innovation,&#8221; Leong Sing Chiong, deputy managing director at MAS, wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through this partnership, we hope to promote the development of common standards and regulatory frameworks that can better support cross border interoperability, as well as sustainable growth of the digital asset ecosystem.&#8221;
</p>
<h2>Singapore Continues Push into Digital Currencies</h2>
<p>
Singapore has been actively engaging with global financial authorities in the realm of digital currencies.</p>
<p>In September 2023, MAS successfully completed a joint test of cross-border trading and settlement of wholesale central bank digital currencies in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements and the central banks of France and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Back in July, Singapore <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/singapore-plans-safeguard-cryptocurrency-investments-with-new-trust-requirement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">also revealed plans</span></a> to impose a trust requirement on cryptocurrency exchanges in a bid to instill confidence in the market and protect investors from potential losses.</p>
<p>At the time, the MAS stated that cryptocurrency exchanges would be required to keep customer assets in a trust.</p>
<p>The new regulation is expected to be implemented before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Additionally, Singapore will proceed with its proposal to ban lending and staking for retail investors.</p>
<p>The MAS <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-may-introduce-risk-test-before-permitting-cryptocurrency-trading.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">initiated a consultation on these measures</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in October last year, just before&nbsp;</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-crypto-prices-crash-instantly.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the FTX debacle</span></a>. The aim of the consultation was to enhance Singapore&rsquo;s regulatory framework for digital assets.</p>
<p>The MAS emphasized that although regulations play a crucial role in safeguarding consumers, traders must exercise caution due to the high risk and speculative nature of digital payment token trading.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has found new momentum by a recent rally that propelled Bitcoin&#8217;s value towards the $35,000 mark.</p>
<p>The surge in price has not only caught the attention of investors but has also sparked a renewed interest in crypto trading, leading to a significant increase in daily exchange volumes.</p>
<p>According to data from The Block, the seven-day moving average for spot exchange volumes across reputable platforms breached an impressive $24 billion on October 26, a level not seen since the end of March.</p>
<p>The sudden resurgence in market activity can be attributed to several factors.</p>
<p>One key driver is the buzz surrounding the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p>Advocates believe that the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF would pave the way for an influx of capital into the market, creating new avenues for investment and further propelling the price of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>As traders await the launch of an ETF, the resulting speculation has injected a level of volatility into the market not seen since April.
</p>
<h2>Some Believe Bitcoin Bull Market Has Started</h2>
<p>
As <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-says-bitcoin-bull-market-already-started-targets-125000-by-december-2024.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a>, crypto financial services platform Matrixport believes Bitcoin&rsquo;s fifth bull run has already started and could see the flagship cryptocurrency reach an impressive $125,000 by December 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bull market officially commenced on June 22, 2023, when Bitcoin reached a new one-year high for the first time in a year. Historically, when this signal was triggered, Bitcoin has delivered, on average, returns of +310%,&rdquo; the company said in a report last week.</p>
<p>In another confirmation of the Bitcoin bull market, the leading cryptocurrency&rsquo;s market dominance <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dominance-reaches-54-as-leading-cryptocurrency-sustains-rally-amid-spot-etf-optimism.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has reached 54%</span></a>, its highest level in more than two and a half years.</p>
<p>The steady increase in Bitcoin dominance, starting from around 38% at the beginning of the year, comes amid its year-long rally, with the flagship cryptocurrency surging by 81% since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matrixport <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-could-hit-42k-if-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-approved-matrixport.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has predicted</span></a> a major Bitcoin rally if a spot ETF hits the market.</p>
<p>Comparing this to the precious metals ETFs, which have a market cap of around $120 billion, assuming that 10-20% of precious metal ETF investors consider diversifying into a Bitcoin ETF as a hedge against monetary debasement and inflation, Matrixport said we could witness an inflow of $12 to $24 billion into the Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Tether&rsquo;s market cap increases by $24 billion, acting as a proxy for potential ETF inflows, Bitcoin&rsquo;s price would rise to $42,000, representing a conservative estimate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brazilian tax department report said that the country&rsquo;s <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/tether/">USDT</a>) trading volume proliferated since 2021. Tether stands out among other stablecoins and has surpassed the volume of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) during the same period.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Among the stablecoins, the cryptocurrency called Tether stands out, which in the period observed by the tax authorities was traded at an accumulated level of more than R$271 billion, almost double the volume of Bitcoin in the same period (more than R$151 billion).&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2023/outubro/criptoativos-receita-federal-detecta-crescimento-vertiginoso-na-movimentacao-de-stablecoins">data</a> from Brazil&rsquo;s revenue service agency, 80% of cryptocurrency transactions in the country are related to USDT. This makes it the most traded digital asset so far in 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering only partial data from 2023, 80% of the reported cryptocurrency movement is related to USDT,&rdquo; the report revealed. Interestingly, the trading volume of the stablecoin has exceeded last year&rsquo;s sum of all other cryptos traded.</p>
<p>The trend complements the recent <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/07/18/crypto-needs-comprehensive-policies-to-protect-economies-and-investors">warning</a> from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It noted that stablecoins &ldquo;could potentially replace official currencies and significantly impact countries&#8217; monetary policies,&rdquo; especially in developing economies.</p>
<p>The Receita Federal do Brasil, has been tracking the growth in stablecoin using sophisticated techniques like AI and network analysis. The report says that the tool has just gained new functionality designed to represent relationships between operators.
</p>
<h1>Brazil&rsquo;s Stablecoin Pivot</h1>
<p>
Amid high inflation and steady devaluation of the Brazilian real, citizens have tripled the traded volume of stablecoins since 2021.</p>
<p>The tax authority previously reported that between January and November 2021, locals traded $11.4 billion in stablecoins. The trading volume was almost triple the total traded in 2020.</p>
<p>Brazil&rsquo;s rising inflation is one of the factors that drove the phenomenon of stablecoin purchases. The country saw an <a href="https://www.ibge.gov.br/explica/inflacao.php">inflation rate of 10.06%</a> in 2021, the highest level since 2015.</p>
<p>Another reason is that Brazilians are forced to pay <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2014/Decreto/D8325.htm#art3">tax on financial operations</a> &ndash; IOF in Portuguese &ndash; while acquiring foreign currency. The tax is however not applicable to stablecoins.</p>
<p>The USDT prevalence in Brazil contrasts with other Latin American nations like Argentina, where Maker&rsquo;s DAI has received more attention.</p>

<p>The regulated <strong>Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)</strong> is steadily climbing the ranks as one of the largest Bitcoin futures and perpetual futures exchanges in a development reminiscent of the early stages of the 2020-2021 bull run.</p>
<p>With a notional open interest (OI) of $3.54 billion, CME has surged from the fourth position to become the second-largest Bitcoin futures exchange, according to <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data from Coinglass</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Notional open interest refers to the U.S. dollar value locked in active or open contracts.</p>
<p>Despite CME&#8217;s impressive rise, crypto exchange Binance still holds the top spot, boasting an open interest of $3.83 billion, 8% higher than CME&#8217;s.
</p>
<h2>CME&#8217;s Cash-Settled Futures Contracts Pass 100,000 BTC Mark</h2>
<p>
It is worth noting that CME&#8217;s cash-settled futures contracts recently surpassing the 100,000 BTC mark for the first time on record.</p>
<p>Additionally, the exchange now commands a lifetime high share of 25% in the BTC futures market.</p>
<p>CME offers standard bitcoin futures contracts equivalent to 5 BTC, along with micro contracts sized at one-tenth of 1 BTC.</p>
<p>The exchange also provides ether futures contracts with a standard size of 50 ETH and micro futures equivalent to one-tenth of 1 ETH.</p>
<p>Open interest in offshore exchanges primarily revolves around perpetual futures that have no expiry and use the funding rate mechanism to stay in sync with the spot price.</p>
<p>Some market observers interpret CME&#8217;s rise as a sign of an institutional-led rally.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has experienced a 27% increase in value this month, driven by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and optimism surrounding spot ETFs.</p>
<p>Retail investors have also played a role in this trend, as evidenced by the significant uptick in futures-based ETFs.</p>
<p>ProShares&#8217; bitcoin futures ETF, for instance, witnessed a staggering 420% surge in rolling five-day volume, reaching $340 million last week. This ETF invests in CME&#8217;s bitcoin futures.
</p>
<h2>Analyst Says CME&#8217;s Rise Indicates Slowing Bearish Positions</h2>
<p>
Andr&eacute; Dragosch, head of research at Deutsche Digital Assets, has said that CME&#8217;s rise is a result of unwinding bearish positions on offshore exchanges rather than being driven by long futures positions.</p>
<p>According to Dragosch, while CME&#8217;s share in BTC futures OI may have increased relative to other exchanges, the aggregate amount of BTC futures and perpetuals OI has not seen a significant increase in BTC terms.</p>
<p>This implies that the recent surge in prices was more likely induced by a short squeeze and a reduction in aggregate open interest.</p>

<p>One of the leading causes of loss of crypto assets is the download of fake wallet applications from search engines.</p>
<p>Fraudsters take advantage of search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM) techniques to promote phishing links that lead to counterfeit wallet apps with malicious backdoors, Bitrace <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NEmwSha1QsI_zuCwTQTLMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said in a recent post</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>These fake apps closely resemble legitimate ones in terms of appearance and usage experience, making it easy for unsuspecting users to fall victim.</p>
<p>Once the user synchronizes their mnemonic phrase or deposits assets into the fake wallet, their tokens are lost forever.</p>
<p>A prime example of this type of scam is the fake Bitpie wallet.</p>
<p>A simple search for &#8220;Bitpie wallet&#8221; yields numerous phishing links on the first page of search engine results.</p>
<p>While the fake wallet&#8217;s website may appear identical to the legitimate one, a closer examination reveals inconsistencies in the URL, exposing its fraudulent nature.
</p>
<h2>Scammers Use Clipboard Hijacking to Steal Cryptos</h2>
<p>
Another tactic used by malicious actors to steal coins is clipboard hijacking.</p>
<p>This classic attack involves gaining control of a victim&#8217;s computer clipboard and replacing copied cryptocurrency addresses with malicious ones.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency investors commonly use the Telegram messaging app, which fraudsters exploit by embedding malicious code into fake versions of the app.</p>
<p>Through social engineering techniques, attackers convince users to download or update the fake app.</p>
<p>When a user pastes a blockchain address into the chat box, the malware identifies it and replaces it with a malicious address.</p>
<p>As a result, unsuspecting individuals inadvertently send funds to the attacker&#8217;s address, unaware of the scam.</p>
<p>In addition to these targeted attacks, cryptocurrency investment frauds often entice users with promises of high returns and low risks.</p>
<p>One such scheme is liquidity staking arbitrage, where users recharge a certain amount of cryptocurrency into a wallet with the expectation of earning a stable income.</p>
<p>However, these websites often embed malicious code in their smart contracts, allowing hackers to gain control of users&#8217; tokens and steal their funds at any time.</p>
<p>To enhance credibility, scammers even ask users to download well-known wallets like OKXweb3 and Trust Wallet.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to remember that wallet services are permissionless, and downloading a reputable wallet does not guarantee the safety of one&#8217;s assets.

<h2>Users Lost Over $330 Million to Crypto Hacks in Q3</h2>
<p>
The crypto space has been plagued by a series of hacks and scams since the start of the year, particularly in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, there were 76 hacks on crypto and Web3 projects and firms in Q3 2023, a significant increase compared to the 30 hacks reported in the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>In total, approximately $332 million has been lost to various exploits, hacks, and scams throughout September, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/september-2023-marks-record-high-crypto-exploits-with-329-million-stolen-report.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">marking a record-high month</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;for crypto exploits.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One notable event was the <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-mixin-networks-cloud-service-provider-hacked-200-million-funds-affected.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mixin Network</span></a> attack on September 23. The Hong Kong-based decentralized cross-chain transfer protocol suffered a substantial breach, resulting in a loss of $200 million due to a breach of its cloud service provider.</p>
<p>Another major incident occurred on September 12, when <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinex-crypto-exchange-hit-by-28-million-exploit-four-hot-wallets-drained.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CoinEx</span></a>, a cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a suspected attack following a substantial outflow from four of its hot wallets. This breach led to losses exceeding $53.1 million across the hot wallets.</p>

<p>Billionaire investor <strong>Mark Cuban</strong> has stressed the need for a &#8220;grandma-friendly&#8221; crypto application that would attract widespread adoption.</p>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-cuban-says-crypto-lacks-141724386.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent episode of Wired&#8217;s &#8220;Tech Support,&#8221;</span></a>&nbsp;Cuban, known for his role on &#8220;Shark Tank&#8221; and as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, discussed various topics, including some challenges the crypto space faces.</p>
<p>He highlighted the common association of crypto with speculation, noting that its true potential lies in creating new applications that enhance convenience and efficiency.</p>
<p>The billionaire also mentioned the need for a &#8220;grandma-friendly&#8221; application that would attract widespread adoption.</p>
<p>He drew a parallel to the iPhone, which gained significant traction when popular apps like Instagram and Snapchat became available.</p>
<p>Cuban suggested that crypto is still waiting for its defining application that appeals to the masses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think back to the iPhone. It came out in 2007, but it wasn&#8217;t until the best apps like Instagram and Snapchat and Facebook went mobile, that the App Store and the iPhone really took off. Crypto is still waiting for its Instagram moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cuban argued that the market is currently underperforming.</p>
<p>However, he drew comparisons to other industries, such as the internet stock market crash, when companies like Amazon and Microsoft experienced significant setbacks before rebounding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not gonna tell you what you should or shouldn&#8217;t do, other than to say with NFTs, the best time to buy is when you&#8217;re a collector and you love the NFT,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<h2>Cuban Talks Wealth and Taxes</h2>
<p>
During the interview, Cuban also shared his insights on wealth, taxes, and the potential of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>For one, the billionaire emphasized the role of luck in achieving billionaire status, stating that luck plays a significant part in the journey to extreme wealth.</p>
<p>He debunked the notion that billionaires can easily replicate their success, highlighting the importance of fortunate circumstances in their achievements.</p>
<p>Expressing a strong belief in the responsibility of the super-rich, Cuban advocated for billionaires to pay higher taxes.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the contributions of the country and the infrastructure that enables success, emphasizing that paying taxes is a patriotic duty.</p>
<p>According to Cuban, wealth should be accompanied by a willingness to contribute to the betterment of society.</p>
<p>When asked how he would make money from scratch with limited resources, Cuban emphasized his sales skills.</p>
<p>He explained that he would seek a sales job and strive to become the best salesperson in the industry.</p>
<p>Cuban also discussed the potential business opportunities presented by technologies like Alexa and language models such as ChatGPT.</p>
<p>He suggested that individuals could leverage their knowledge of these technologies to provide services and training to others.</p>
<p>For example, teaching people how to optimize the use of Alexa in their homes or guiding businesses in utilizing ChatGPT for their operations.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So if you just get involved and stay ahead, you&#8217;re gonna be the person in demand, selling your services on how to prompt ChatGPT to help a business, or even to tutor kids on how to best use it for school.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
