<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum (ETH)</span></a>&#8216;s upcoming <strong>Dencun</strong> upgrade, expected in the first quarter of 2024, will play a crucial role in the blockchain&#8217;s journey towards scalability as a settlement layer.</p>
<p>In <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/27/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-is-a-step-toward-a-scalable-settlement-layer-goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a recent note</span></a>, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> highlighted the primary impact of the Dencun upgrade, which is increasing data availability for layer-2 rollups through proto-danksharding.</p>
<p>The bank claimed that this enhancement will result in reduced transaction costs for rollups, ultimately benefiting end users.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Dencun&rsquo;s primary impact will be to increase its data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, resulting in a reduction of rollup transaction costs which will be passed on to end users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the context of blockchain technology, a layer 1 network serves as the foundation or underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>Layer 2 refers to off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.</p>
<p>Rollups, which are part of layer 2, process transactions on a faster blockchain and then transfer the data back to the parent blockchain at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>The proto-danksharding feature of the Dencun upgrade will not only improve data availability for layer-2 rollups but also lay the groundwork for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding.</p>
<p>Danksharding is a methodology that aims to enhance Ethereum&#8217;s scalability by dividing the network into shards, expanding data storage capacity rather than solely increasing transaction throughput.
</p>
<h2>Dencun to Improve Ethereum&#8217;s Scalability</h2>
<p>
According to the Goldman Sachs report, Dencun will enhance Ethereum&#8217;s scalability through the implementation of rollups.</p>
<p>Additionally, it will optimize gas fees, improve network security, and introduce several housekeeping updates aimed at overall network improvement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently admitted that centralization of nodes is one of the network&rsquo;s biggest challenges, given the fact that the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum full nodes are run on centralized platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
<p>The Ethereum mastermind said that he hopes in the future fully verified Ethereum <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-ethereums-future-upgrades-could-bring-full-nodes-mobile-devices.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">nodes can &ldquo;literally&rdquo; run on a phone</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p>He claimed that solving the issue with centralization of full nodes is a &ldquo;big piece of the puzzle&rdquo; to making Ethereum more decentralized.</p>
<p>As <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-ethereum-staking-providers-promise-not-own-more-than-22-of-validators.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a>, in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of the ETH network, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule.</p>
<p>The rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool, StakeWise, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, and Puffer Finance are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit, Ethereum core developer Superphiz said in a recent tweet.</p>

Fundamentals</strong></h2><p>But some of Ether&rsquo;s relative weakness can likely be explained by &ldquo;weak&rdquo; fundamentals relating to the cryptocurrency.</p><p>For instance, demand for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/proshares-launches-six-ether-futures-etfs-expanding-crypto-etf-market.htm">recently launched Ether futures ETFs</a> in the US was very weak, suggesting limited institutional interest.</p><p>That shouldn&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise given that spot Ether trading volumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges remain at around their weakest since late 2020 as per The Block, back when the Ether price was in the hundreds of dollars.</p><p>Meanwhile, as per data presented by <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/eth-core-on-chain">Glassnode</a>, in a sign of weak on-chain activity, <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=ETH&amp;c=native&amp;m=fees.GasPriceMean&amp;resolution=24h">gas fees</a> have been falling as of late, meaning a lower ETH burn rate.</p><p>In recent weeks, the ETH burn rate has fallen below the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s issuance rate, meaning that the <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/2380c497-307a-488f-6bbf-eb077118afde">Ether supply has at times become inflationary once again</a>.</p><p>Since the end of August, the <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=ETH&amp;c=native&amp;m=supply.Current&amp;resolution=24h">ETH supply</a> has subsequently risen by just over 100,000 to just above 120 million, reducing the token&rsquo;s scarcity and weighing on its value.</p><p>On-chain weakness, and the overall seemingly subdued demand for Ether, is further evident in the stagnation of the blockchain&rsquo;s TVL.</p><p>As per <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum">DeFi Llama</a>, Ethereum&rsquo;s TVL has been in a downtrend since peaking in April at around $70 billion, and, at around $48 billion, remains well below its early 2022 all-time peak above $200 billion.</p><p>Rising interest rates on risk-free US government bonds probably explain this stagnation &ndash; why buy highly volatile staked Ether derivatives for a yield of less than 4% when you can get a yield of over 5% on risk-free US government bonds?</p><p>High US (and other) government bond yields will remain a key headwind to the health and growth of Ethereum&rsquo;s DeFi ecosystem.</p><h2><strong>Price Prediction &ndash; What&rsquo;s Next for Ether (ETH)?</strong></h2><p>All that being said, Ether price predictions could be about to take a substantial turn for the better if the cryptocurrency is able to break above key resistance at the $1,700 level.</p><p>ETH is currently facing headwinds in this area from a downtrend from the July highs and from the 100DMA.</p><p>But should Ether break above this level, a run higher towards the 200DMA just under $1,800 level is likely, with a break above this area opening the door to a run higher towards the summer highs just above $2,000.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" sizes="100vw" width="1787" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/126755/334706/eth.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126755/334706/responsive-images/eth___media_library_original_1787_728.jpg 1787w, https://cimg.co/news/126755/334706/responsive-images/eth___media_library_original_1200_489.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/126755/334706/responsive-images/eth___media_library_original_900_367.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/126755/334706/responsive-images/eth___media_library_original_720_293.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/126755/334706/responsive-images/eth___media_library_original_600_244.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126755/334706/responsive-images/eth___media_library_original_300_122.jpg 300w"><figcaption>Ether (ETH) Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>With the broader market rallying, led by Bitcoin, Ether will likely continue to pull higher in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Will it be able to outperform Bitcoin, however? Probably not.</p><p>Ether&rsquo;s outperformance probably won&rsquo;t become a major narrative again until its aforementioned weak fundamentals (on-chain activity, TVL) start seeing solid improvements.</p><h2><strong>Crypto Alternative to Consider &#8211; Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)</strong></h2><p>The outlook for blue-chip crypto markets is good, but traders should always be on the lookout for diversification opportunities.</p><p>An exciting new decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol called Bitcoin Minetrix is generating a lot of hype, and has already raised over $2.1 million in funds from early investors into its $BTCMTX token presale.</p><p>$BTCMTX is the token that powers the protocol &ndash; investors who buy $BTCMTX can then stake their tokens to start earning non-transferable Bitcoin Minetrix mining credits.</p><p>These credits can then be burnt by their owners, and in exchange, they will get a share in Bitcoin Minetrix&rsquo;s Bitcoin mining revenues.</p><p>$BTCMTX token holders will also earn $BTCMTX rewards, with a portion of the token supply already set aside to reward early stakers.</p><p>Bitcoin Minetrix&rsquo;s protocol is governor by smart contracts built on top of the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which is also where its token is issued.</p><p>The protocol thus offers better transparency and security versus other centralized cloud mining services.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Check Out Bitcoin Minetrix Here</a></p>

and because Ethereum has &ldquo;a more distributed shareholder base&rdquo; than the other networks, one analyst said.</p>

The Convergence of TradFi and Crypto</strong></h2><p>&ldquo;The convergence between crypto and traditional asset classes, including fiat currencies, equities, government bonds, and real estate, is experiencing an unprecedented growth,&rdquo; 21.co noted in its report.</p><p>As the crypto sector matures, more and more traditional institutions will build their own products on top of blockchains, the analysts argued.</p><p>&ldquo;Through this transition, crypto will increasingly integrate with existing financial software and bring RWAs on-chain via tokenization&rdquo;.</p><p>Regulatory barriers and a potential lack of standardized processes are amongst the factors that 21.co thinks could slow the growth and adoption of tokenized RWAs.</p><h2><strong>Tokenized RWAs to Power Ether (ETH) to Multi-Trillion Dollar Market Cap?</strong></h2><p>Assuming blockchains like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> are able to maintain a dominant position as a place to issue tokenized RWAs, this could substantially bolster the demand for Ether (ETH) in the years ahead.</p><p>Ether (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and is used to pay gas fees that power transactions and blockchain activity.</p><p>Ether&rsquo;s market cap was last around $188 billion, around 3x more than the $60 billion in tokenized assets currently issued directly onto its blockchain.</p><p>But if by 2030, the blockchain hosts 60% of $10 trillion in tokenized RWAs, it wouldn&rsquo;t be out of the question to see Ether become multi-trillion dollar asset, potentially even rivalling gold&rsquo;s market cap, which was last around $12.8 trillion.</p><p>That being said, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/time-dump-ethereum-eth-buy-bitcoin-btc-3-reasons-why-that-might-good-idea.htm">Ether has been performing poorly recently</a>, down over 6% on the month and over 25% lower since this year&rsquo;s highs.</p><p>Week demand for the recently launched Ether futures ETFs in the US and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereums-supply-surges-47-million-worth-of-eth-added-30-days.htm">weak on-chain activity that has seen the Ether supply turn inflationary once again</a> are two factors explaining recent weak performance.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-validator-queues-for-entry-exit-positions-drop-new-record-lows-report.htm">Falling yields on staked ETH</a> (last at around 3.5% APY) at a time when US bond yields are rising (the 10-year is above 4.8%) is another structural headwinds, while still relatively high transaction fees and relatively slow transaction times continue to act as a barrier to adoption.</p><p>Ether was last trading in the $1,570 area, with bears eyeing a break below a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-standard-chartered-forecasts-8k-price-by-2026-will-ether-eth-break-below-key-support-level.htm">key long-term support</a> in the low $1,500s that could open the door to a drop towards the sub-$1,400 March lows.</p>

</figure><p>The average wait time (queue) for validators to join the blockchain network is zero minutes, compared to the 45 days and 22 hours validators had to queue in for in early June.&nbsp;</p><p>At press time, the activation and exit limit for validators, known as Churn Limit, has increased from 12 to 13 epochs. This means a daily limit of 2,925 validators can join or exit the Ethereum network.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ethereum Staking Rewards Continues To Plummet&nbsp;</h2><p>The dwindling rate of Ethereum&rsquo;s entry and exit queues for validators is the first for the network since it launched &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/28/shapella-mainnet-announcement"><u>Shanghai</u></a>,&rdquo; also referred to as Shapella upgrade, in April.&nbsp;</p><p>The upgrade signaled Ethereum&#8217;s upcoming transition to an anticipated and fully functional proof-of-stake network (PoS) and propelled the rise of institutional investors depositing large amounts of ETH.&nbsp;</p><p>Validators maintain and secure Ethereum&#8217;s proof-of-stake blockchain by locking up their Ether. In exchange, they earn staking rewards.&nbsp;</p><p>Validators were granted the ability to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, eliminating risk factors for investors concerned about not getting their funds back. Unfortunately, things have now started to cool off.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Glassnode&rsquo;s <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/eth-core-on-chain"><u>Ethereum on-chain data metrics</u></a>, staking rewards have dropped significantly to nearly 3.3% from the previous 7% earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the slump in yields, ETH supply <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereums-supply-surges-47-million-worth-of-eth-added-30-days.htm"><u>increased</u></a> by $47M last week. Many analysts attributed this increase in supply to the decline in transaction activity in the past few days.</p><p>Nevertheless, while the demand for staking ETH has dropped, the number of active validators has also increased.&nbsp;</p><p>Validator Queues report shows that there are currently 861,938 active validators on the Ethereum network, with 22.79% of the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s supply staked.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img class="content-img lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="100vw" alt="" width="1600" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/126452/333901/pasted-image-0-4.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126452/333901/responsive-images/pasted-image-0-4___media_library_original_1600_448.jpg 1600w, https://cimg.co/news/126452/333901/responsive-images/pasted-image-0-4___media_library_original_1200_336.jpg 1200w, https://cimg.co/news/126452/333901/responsive-images/pasted-image-0-4___media_library_original_900_252.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/news/126452/333901/responsive-images/pasted-image-0-4___media_library_original_720_202.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/news/126452/333901/responsive-images/pasted-image-0-4___media_library_original_600_168.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126452/333901/responsive-images/pasted-image-0-4___media_library_original_300_84.jpg 300w">

Adobe</figcaption></figure><p>It&rsquo;s been an ugly month so far for Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network, that remains the dominant blockchain used to power most sectors within web3, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-news/">NFTs</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-gaming-cryptos.htm">GameFi</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3s-hottest-gamblefi-presale-tgcasino-surges-beyond-250000-get-early-before-tgc-pumps.htm">GambleFi</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/friendtech-developers-amass-nearly-20-million-since-august-debut.htm">SocialFi</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">ETH</a> price, which was last trading just under $1,550 after hitting new seven-month lows earlier this week at $1,520, is down a little over 7.5% for the month.</p><p>The world&rsquo;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is thus on course to post its third negative month in four, having now pulled back around 28% from April&rsquo;s yearly highs close to $2,150.</p><p>By contrast, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), the world&rsquo;s first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was last trading with losses of only around 0.5% for the month.</p><p>At current levels in the $26,800s, BTC is down a more conservative 16% from its earlier yearly highs near $32,000, which were hit back in June.</p><p>With the ETH/BTC pair having recent hit its lowest level in 15 months earlier this week under 0.058 following a downtrend that has lasted around one year, some investors are asking whether now might be the time to dump Ethereum and buy Bitcoin.</p><p>Here are three reasons why that might be a good idea.</p><h2><strong>The Technicals Tell a Bearish Story</strong></h2><p>ETH/BTC has been stuck within a bearish falling wedge patter for the best part of a year.</p><p>That is, until about one week ago, when the cross bearishly broke to the downside of this pattern.</p><p>ETH/BTC has since proceeded to find strong resistance at the downtrend that had formerly been offering support.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="1792" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/126364/333693/ethbtc.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126364/333693/responsive-images/ethbtc___media_library_original_1792_717.jpg 1792w,

720w, https://cimg.co/news/126364/333693/responsive-images/ethbtc___media_library_original_600_240.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/news/126364/333693/responsive-images/ethbtc___media_library_original_300_120.jpg 300w"></figure><p>That, combined with the fact that the cross has also in recent months been finding strong resistance at its major moving averages, suggests momentum remains firmly in the hands of the bears.</p><p>Recent technical developments strongly suggest a continuation of the recent bearish market bias, and that a test of the mid-2022 lows around 0.049 remain is on the cards for the months ahead.</p><h2><strong>Ether Faces Demand Headwinds and Inflation</strong></h2><p>Whilst falling spot trading volumes across crypto major cryptocurrency exchanges are indicative of overall subdued demand for cryptocurrencies right now, the poor demand problem seems to be particularly acute for Ether.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="707" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/126364/333694/spot-crypto-volumes.jpg"

https://cimg.co/news/126364/333694/responsive-images/spot-crypto-volumes___media_library_original_300_188.jpg 300w"></figure><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/proshares-launches-six-ether-futures-etfs-expanding-crypto-etf-market.htm">A batch of Ether futures Exchange Traded Funds</a> (ETFs) went live in the US last week, but despite a lot of hype, only managed to attract very weak trading volumes, suggesting institutions remain on the sidelines for now.</p><p>That shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a surprise given Ether future trading volumes have been shrinking sharply now since March.</p><p>As per data presented by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/futures">The Block</a>, Ether future trading volumes were only around $250 billion in September, down from around $770 billion in March.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" width="710" class="content-img lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/126364/333695/ether-futures.jpg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/news/126364/333695/responsive-images/ether-futures___media_library_original_710_445.jpg 710w,

https://cimg.co/news/126364/333695/responsive-images/ether-futures___media_library_original_300_188.jpg 300w"></figure><p>And it&rsquo;s not just trading data that suggests fading demand.</p><p>Various on-chain metrics such as active users, number of transfers, total transfer volume and new addresses have been stagnating now for some time.</p><p>That has culminated recently low gas fees and the Ether supply turning inflationary.</p><p>As per <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/eth-core-on-chain">Glassnode</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereums-supply-surges-47-million-worth-of-eth-added-30-days.htm">the Ether supply was last just over 119.98 million</a>, up from under 119.9 million in late August.</p><p>Demand for Ether staking had been a bright spot for the token this year.</p><p>But ETH staking yields are currently consistently below 4%, as opposed to closer to 5% for long-term US government bonds.</p><p>These bonds are considered a risk-free asset, so investors may continue to prefer parking their cash in the safe haven bond market, rather than risking it with Ether for a lower yield.</p><h2><strong>Bitcoin Looks Like the Better Near-term Bet</strong></h2><p>As well as facing technical and demand headwinds, Ether also faces greater regulatory risks in the US than Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, after all, is the only cryptocurrency that the current SEC leadership has explicitly said it doesn&rsquo;t think is a security.</p><p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-crackdown-crypto-harsh-realization-or-necessary-clarity.htm">SEC has been on a rampage</a> in 2023 suing major US firms and labeling<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defying-sec-solana-cardano-polygon-disagree-with-security-label.htm"> cryptocurrencies as securities</a>.</p><p>While the agency hasn&rsquo;t yet explicitly stated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-sec-chair-gary-gensler-refuses-say-if-eth-security-bullish-for-ethereum.htm">their view that Ether is a security</a>, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has in the past argued that he thinks ETH is a security.</p><p>That means that investors will remain on edge about the regulatory outlook for ETH in the US until there is more certainty, which will probably only come from 1) Congress passing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-senators-cynthia-lummis-kirsten-gillibrand-propose-legislation-regulate-digital-assets.htm">comprehensive crypto legislation</a> or 2) a series of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-sec-unleashes-new-appeal-against-ripple-will-xrp-crash-zero.htm">decisive defeats for the SEC</a> in its various lawsuits against US crypto firms (which are unlikely to culminate any time soon).</p><p>Bitcoin thus remains a safe haven within the crypto space.</p><p>With bullish narratives around Bitcoin likely to grow into 2024, with the SEC expected to greenlight various spot Bitcoin ETFs and the halving coming up in April, now is probably a good time to pivot towards the world&rsquo;s foremost cryptocurrency.</p>

examples in which real-world industries come on-chain to exploit the benefits of Ethereum over their existing setups,&rdquo; Kendrick argued, adding &ldquo;we expect significant developments on these fronts by 2025-26&rdquo;.</p><p>Kendrick added that the bank could rally back towards $4,000 by the end of 2024, with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">halving</a> helping to lift all boats in the crypto world.</p><h2><strong>Price Prediction &ndash;

He mentioned that cryptocurrency exchanges like Huobi Global and even other cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu might have CCP connections. This could add another layer of complexity to ongoing regulatory discussions and investor confidence in the crypto sector.</p><h2><strong>What These Allegations Mean for the Crypto Industry</strong></h2><p>While these allegations are still unconfirmed, they add to the growing concerns around the integrity of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory bodies have been increasingly vigilant, and this could be the tipping point for more stringent regulations in the crypto space. Investors are likely to proceed with caution until more concrete evidence is provided to either substantiate or refute these claims.</p><p>The recent allegations against Tron and Ethereum could serve as a catalyst for an industry-wide introspection on the ethical and legal standing of cryptocurrencies. Although the crypto market has long been mired in controversies, the severity and breadth of these new claims are likely to usher in a period of increased scrutiny and potentially, regulatory overhaul.&nbsp;</p>
