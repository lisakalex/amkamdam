Crypto has its own version of meme stocks &#8211; meme coins &#8211; with traders always hunting the next Dogecoin to explode when noticed by Elon Musk, the next Shiba Inu, or most recently the next Pepe to outperform the entire market by tens of thousands of percent.</p><p>Does $WSM have what it takes to be the next big crypto? This Wall Street Memes token price prediction reviews the project&#8217;s roadmap and future upside potential.</p><h2>Wall Street Memes Price Prediction &#8211; Key Points</h2><ul><li><strong>End of 2023: </strong>The Wall Street Memes token presale began at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>wallstmemes.com</u></a> on May 26, 2023, selling out its first presale round by raising $500,000 within 48 hours. With a hard cap target of $30,577,000, it may sell out and have its first DEX and CEX listings by Q4 2023.</li><li><strong>2024 &#8211; 2025:</strong> While the $WSM listing price hasn&#8217;t been confirmed, with the incremental price stages during the presale and its 2 billion supply &#8211; 50% of which is allocated to the presale &#8211; the Wall Street Memes market cap at launch will be just under $35 million. New meme coins that build a community often test the $100 million market cap level shortly after their ICO.</li><li><strong>Up to 2030:</strong> Meme coins already often outperform BTC and ETH &#8211; if the next crypto bull run takes place after 2024&#8217;s Bitcoin halving the rise of meme assets could continue. New entrants to crypto as the blockchain sees mass adoption could gravitate towards coins like Wall Street Memes, backed by a community whose content Elon Musk has at one point interacted with. Pepe hit an almost $2bn market cap in 2023 even as a relatively unknown asset.</li></ul><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Wall Street Memes Presale</a></div></div><h2>Wall Street Memes Price Stages</h2><p>The WSM coin price started at $0.025 during its first presale round, which sold out within days and is now priced slightly higher, still affording a discount to early buyers &#8211; to incentivize those taking on the most risk.

They can do what other crypto assets cannot &#8211; make exponential gains in a matter of days, as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe (PEPE) most famously showed &#8211; alongside Floki Inu, Wojak, Turbo and many more.</p><p>Earlier this year for example <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1648137350059311105"><u>Altcoin Sherpa</u></a> tweeted a thread to his 195k followers:</p><blockquote><p>They&#8217;re kind of the original NFT in a lot of ways. Meme coins are built around a simple idea that&#8217;s easy for people to understand (ie. a Dog). You don&#8217;t need a big brain to understand it and you don&#8217;t need to go through complicated steps to work with it (ie. DeFi). We all want to get rich and to get rich fast. What better way than to do it with meme coins?</p></blockquote><p>While he cautioned that some meme tokens are scams, rugpulls, or just have low utility, he stated they can have &#8216;500x&#8217; upside potential or more.&nbsp;</p><p>They can then retrace by 90% or deeper &#8211; making investing early the best bet, at the pre-ICO, IDO or IEO stage, during pre-sale rounds if they are open to the public.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" width="697" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/news/114499/276490/pepe-price-chart.jpg" data-srcset=""></figure><p>The Pepe price for example corrected 80% after an explosive bull run far beyond what GameStop stocks achieved, making many holders millionaires. Even the Ethereum price at one point retraced 95% (from $1,440 to $80) before setting new all-time highs.</p><p>The most upside potential tends to be realized by following the trading mantra of <i>buy low, sell high</i>, and sticking to well-established projects with a trusted team.</p><p>Wall Street Memes draws on their experience of launching successful NFT projects &#8211; that did not scam investors and are still around today. Wall St Bulls NFTs have 3,532 owners according to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls"><u>OpenSea</u></a>.</p><p>In 2022 <a href="https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1567221067625676802"><u>@MacnBTC</u></a> tweeted to his 414k followers:</p><blockquote><p><i>Someone with a $10,000 portfolio should not focus on buying $ETH and $BTC but rather possibly aim to get whitelisted in NFT projects and gamble on dogecoins that either go x50 or -100%.</i></p></blockquote><p>His sentiment is similar &#8211; that DOGE themed cryptos, or meme tokens in general can have 50x potential and can also fail completely. That averages out to a high profit potential, as long you adopt a risk management strategy &#8211; e.g. keeping a diversified portfolio and not over-investing in one crypto project.</p><p>See our <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm"><u>list of crypto presales</u></a> for some other options to invest in early. We rank the Wall Street Memes presale our top pick currently for being on its earliest stages and history in the NFT and meme space.</p><iframe title="Wall Street Meme NEW 10X CRYPTO PRESALE - Next Crypto to Explode? $WSM 100x Crypto Gem &#x1f525;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2DTEOjOVxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The Wall Street Memes tokenomics are highlighted in the video above, with 100% available to the community &#8211; including 50% sold during the WSM presale, 30% for future community rewards and 20% for CEX and DEX liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p>There not being any team tokens set aside can guard against an issue a similar project faced &#8211; Wall Street Baby (WSB). After claiming to be the official token of the Wall Street Bets Reddit, insiders on the $WSB project team dumped a large portion of the WSB token supply on the market, causing a 90% crash in the Wall Street Baby price.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With a wide reach on social media that saw the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en"><u>wallstmemes.com</u></a> presale sell out its first stage within days with little media coverage in the crypto space, WSM could have high upside potential.</p><p>A conservative Wall Street Memes price prediction might be for WSM to test the $100 million market cap level, which recent new meme coin launches we reviewed such as Sponge and Tamadoge reached. In the most bullish case, Pepe still has a ~$600 million market cap even after its deep correction, and two meme coins rank in the top fifteen cryptocurrency assets &#8211; SHIB valued at $5 billion and DOGE in the top ten with a $10 billion market cap.</p><p>Having an established community leads to more holders rather than short term traders looking to take profit early and move onto the next asset. NFT investors also usually hold their digital assets for a longer period, and many of the Wall St Bulls NFT community may have formed the early investors into $WSM.</p><p>The project is also building up publicity with a $50,000 airdrop hosted on outreach platform <a href="https://gleam.io/xKLkf/wall-street-memes-50000-airdrop"><u>Gleam.io</u></a>, to be shared between five winners.</p><div class="raw-html-embed"><div style="background: #920047;margin: auto;width: 50%;text-align: center;padding: 8px;border-radius: 5px;background-image: linear-gradient(107deg,#930046,#59008a);color: white;padding-left: 1em;padding-right: 1em;font-size: 16px"><a style="text-decoration:none;color:white" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/wallstreetmemes/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex">Visit Wall Street Memes Presale</a></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.</i></p>

In this article, we&#8217;ll explore four upcoming ICOs set to make waves in their respective industries: Fight Out, Republic Note, C+Charge, TagoVerse, and Backstage.</p><h2><strong>Fitness with Web3 and M2E Technology: A Look into Fight Out</strong></h2><p>The fitness industry has been plagued by high dropout rates and gym closures, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fight Out is a project that aims to address these issues by leveraging <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/abu-dhabi-goes-all-in-on-crypto-with-2-billion-investment-program-for-web3-and-blockchain-startups.htm"><u>Web3</u></a> and move-to-earn (M2E) technology.</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Metaverse is no longer science fiction &#8211; it&#39;s happening now.

Users will be able to track and compare stats with others to make every workout an exciting challenge.</p><p>Users can also earn REPS tokens, which incentivize them to work out at home or in the gym. These tokens can be redeemed for discounts on subscriptions, merchandise, and gym memberships.</p><p>Fight Out is positioning itself to make inroads in the fitness sector by fostering a community-driven, personalized, and goal-oriented environment. Investors have a unique chance to take advantage of this investment opportunity that offers bonuses up to 50% in the project&#8217;s token presale for investments over $50,000. FGHT tokens have already raised close to $4.39 million in the presale period, with the next phase soon to begin at higher prices.</p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/fightout/en"><strong><u>Visit Fight Out Now</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Republic Note: Upcoming ICO Shares in Republic&#8217;s Success</strong></h2><p>Republic, an alternative investment platform, is launching its own digital security called Republic Note. The Republic Note is a profit-sharing instrument with a finite supply that aims to bring profit to investors by distributing dividends when companies succeed.</p><p>The Republic ecosystem provides individual investors access to a wide range of investment opportunities, including early-stage startups, growth-stage/pre-IPO technology companies, crypto, e-sports and video games, real estate, and Main Street investments. The platform has connected over 2.5 million investors from 100+ countries and enabled them to invest a combined $1.5 billion in global projects.</p><p>Republic Note will allow investors to own a piece of the profits from certain Republic business lines and will be backed by Republic Core&#8217;s profit-sharing interests in select portfolio companies.</p><p>Some of the companies that have raised capital with Republic include <a href="https://www.space.com/meet-spacex-crew-dragon-crew-6-astronauts"><u>SpaceX</u></a>, Avalanche, and Gumroad. When corporations experience a successful exit resulting in cash proceeds, some of the money will go to the Republic Note pool.</p><p>Once the total amount of allocations reaches $2 million, proportional payouts will be given to all owners of Republic Notes. Subsequent distributions will happen each time this threshold is reached (or earlier depending on the decision made by Republic Core).</p><h2><strong>Charging Towards a Sustainable Future: The Innovations of C+Charge</strong></h2><p>Electric vehicle (EV) owners face challenges in finding nearby charging stations and dealing with vague pricing. C+Charge aims to address these issues by offering a mobile app for EV owners that provides real-time data on nearby charging options and diagnoses the vehicle for any charging issues.</p><p>C+Charge is also developing its own charging stations and partnering with existing ones while allowing users to pay with the exclusive CCHG token. The blockchain technology utilized by the CCHG <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-buy-today-17-february-memag-matic-fght-lrc-cchg-fil-ria.htm"><u>cryptocurrency</u></a> guarantees efficient and transparent transactions, providing users with a superior payment processing experience. In addition to streamlined payments, EV owners who use C+Charge will also earn carbon credits through Goodness Native Tokens (GNT), which can be stored in the C+Charge app to be traded.</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How can technology help the future of mobility?<br><br>Technology brings more data and connectivity to mobility efficiency<br><br>We allow our users to find the nearest charging stations with the real-time data analysis<br><br>Buy some <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCHG&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$CCHG</a> now<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b07.png" alt="⬇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/ixe18bPqzI">https://t.co/ixe18bPqzI</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/presale?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#presale</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Refi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Refi</a> <a href="https://t.co/CKFdS1YLXL">pic.twitter.com/CKFdS1YLXL</a></p>&mdash; C+Charge (@C_Charge_Token) <a href="https://twitter.com/C_Charge_Token/status/1626974897086902274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>C+Charge has already sold out the first stage of its presale and has raised over $1.261 million.

With the growing number of people experiencing mental health issues, the demand for therapy and advice has risen sharply. TagoVerse is looking to help by creating the world&#8217;s first mental health metaverse.</p><p>TagoVerse is creating a platform where individuals can easily connect with mental health professionals from anywhere in the world. TagoVerse also has its own token in its ecosystem which can be used as a reward for users who contribute to the growth of the platform.</p><p>The platform is designed with an &#8220;Evolve to Earn&#8221; mechanism, where experts and contributors must earn their rewards through successful bookings and high ratings. The token can also be used to pay for products and services on the platform, or for staking, which earns interest and grants administrative rights.</p><p>To ensure fairness and efficiency, TagoVerse has divided its tokenomics as follows: 40% for the staking program and ecosystem development, 8% for reserved, 5% for DEX liquidity, 10% for marketing and community, 12% for private funding round &amp; 7% for IDO, 3% for advisors, and 15% for the foundation.</p><h2><strong>Backstage in the Events Industry</strong></h2><p>Backstage is a new company specializing in event financing that offers a solution to the financing issues facing the event industry. The event industry has always been a high-risk market, and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/covid-19-pandemic-made-1-6-mn-youth-idle-in-pakistan-world-bank-report-123021900813_1.html"><u>Covid-19 pandemic</u></a> has further complicated matters. With restrictions still in place, the industry is struggling to finance its activities.</p><p>Backstage&#8217;s vision is to digitize the event industry, making it more resilient, circular, and profitable. The company is developing technologies that support B2C, B2B2C, and B2B services. Backstage is creating an NFT ticketing platform that will be followed by new technology and business models based on transparency, circularity, and sustainability. Backstage&#8217;s NFT platform offers a second element of innovation that includes the creation of NFT tickets that act as a sales channel for artists and venues.</p><p>The company&#8217;s ecosystem, called &#8220;The Stage,&#8221; connects blockchain-based applications powered by the BKS utility token, community, and industry. The Stage includes the BKS marketplace, NFT ticketing, loyalty NFTs, BKS launchpad, crypto POS wallet, and staking and LP staking.</p>

However, despite being in decline, utility token offerings together with hybrid token offerings are still the most successful ones, the report showed. </p><p>&#8220;Compared to Q2, the number of projects offering service tokens increased by 6.55%. The share of projects offering security tokens increased by 1.66%. The number of projects with utility tokens decreased by 10.07%,&#8221; according to the agency.</p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29edade62e.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29edade62e.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/29edade62e.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/29edade62e.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/29edade62e.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/29edade62e.png 1238w"><figcaption>Source: ICORating</figcaption></figure><p>Almost half of all ICOs in Q3 offered service tokens (a token used as the internal currency to pay for project services), while a quarter went for utility tokens (tokens of the protocol itself). The numbers keep halving, with around 12.5% of projects offering hybrid tokens (payment for services + bonuses for work performed), around 6.5% selling security tokens (tokens secured by an obligation, like promises of dividend payment, receipt of company shares, etc.), etc.</p><p>However, just because half of all ICOs are offering a certain type of token, doesn&rsquo;t mean that this is what investors want. Hybrid, reward and utility tokens are the ones raising the most capital in this quarter, while cryptocurrencies, security and service tokens all raised less than a median amount of USD 250,000. Service tokens were also the most likely to fail, with around half of those projects not making it. Only hybrid token projects had more successful projects than failed ones. What this could indicate is that investors are looking for more options offered in the tokens, preferably returns coming from multiple sources (both from services and bonuses, for example), and that project teams are a bit slow to catch on. </p><p><b>Number of unsuccessful ICOs by token type</b></p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/29f3c0c6be.png 1222w"><figcaption>Source: ICORating</figcaption></figure><p>All in all, ICOs raised around USD 1.8 billion dollars in Q3 &#8211; a steep downturn compared to Q2, when USD 8.3 billion was collected. 57 percent of them were unable to raise more than USD 100,000, and only 4% managed to get listed on exchanges (compared with 7% in Q2.)</p><p><b>Number of successful projects and their funding</b></p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bf/29fc73c4cb.png 1456w"><figcaption>Source: ICORating</figcaption></figure><p>Close to half of all ICOs originated in Europe. This could arguably stem from the fact that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on ICOs, requiring them to follow a legal framework and ramping up their vigorous oversight of the industry. Recently, the SEC settled charges with two such companies, <b>Airfox</b> and <b>Paragon Coin</b>, mandating they register their offerings as securities and reimburse investors due to improperly offering digital tokens.</p><p>Other US authorities are stepping up to help regulate the space as well. Maksim Zaslavskiy, a former institutional developer and self-proclaimed businessman, is now facing up to five years in prison for orchestrating two fake ICOs last year. Following the case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), said that they will &ldquo;continue to pursue any individual who seeks to profit by exploiting others.&rdquo; Further, the SEC also filing related civil charges against Zaslavskiy, which are to be settled following the court&rsquo;s criminal sentencing.</p><p>Following these cases, the SEC published a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/digital-asset-securites-issuuance-and-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading</a>,&rdquo; detailing the way ICOs are to be held in order to stay compliant with current regulations, mostly telling future ICOs to register. The community&rsquo;s reaction to this is mixed: Reddit user u/WantedToGetInvolved writes, &ldquo;Blockchain companies should move away from these restrictive frameworks and take innovation elsewhere,&rdquo; while u/elizabethgiovanni writes, &ldquo;This is good news because funds and organizations and high net individuals won&rsquo;t touch this space without know what risk they&rsquo;re exposing themselves to.&rdquo;</p><p>The regulatory difficulties in the US are prompting some investors to skip this market completely. Recently, Antanas Guoga, Member of European Parliament, a serial entrepreneur, investor, and backer of <i>Cryptonews.com</i>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/soprano-ice-cream-and-security-tokens-exploring-new-crypto-t-2889.htm">announced </a>the acquisition and upcoming security token offering (STO) of an ice cream chain called <b>Soprano</b>. &ldquo;Europe is definitely the jurisdiction for STOs, because we don&rsquo;t have the draconian security laws that America has. America will be off the books, as they&rsquo;re very difficult and expensive to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the cryptoverse and the initial coin offering (ICO) landscape are changing, startups need to adapt in order to find the best way to move forward. </p><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bd/b0d80b94a5.jpg 1254w" alt="" class="content-img"><figcaption>Source: iStock/MatusDuda</figcaption></figure><p>One of the examples is <b><a href="https://hiway.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hiway</a></b>, a developer of a marketplace for work focused on the blockchain industry. Even after two years of development, they had to change their prototype launch plans and review their crowdsale process. At the same time, their private sale is currently happening. The softcap is still undetermined, while their hardcap is USD 8 million.</p><p><i>Cryptonews.com</i> talked to Simon Rikmenspoel, the founder and CFO of Hiway, about how they have adapted. In either case, he said that the startup is &ldquo;almost ready to share a working platform.&rdquo;</p><p><b>How does the current <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/icos-hit-new-low-but-production-picking-up-2595.htm">downturn in the crowdsale market</a> and the rise of venture capital funding affect your plans and how do you respond to this?</b></p><figure class="left"><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 300px, 300px" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5be/3cbcc1a16d.jpeg 956w"><figcaption>Simon Rikmenspoel</figcaption></figure><p>It affected our plans completely. Instead of doing a &#8216;normal&#8217; funding round, we chose to focus more on the development of the platform, because there might be less people who will show their interest in the platform by way of the crowdsale (because of the market). So instead of spending a lot of funds on arranging a crowdsale, we prefer more marketing with obtaining freelancers and just getting the platform up and running as the main goal.</p><p><b>The private sale is currently happening, but your website has no other details about the timeline of your token (WAY) sale.</b></p><p>Currently, we are focusing on launching the prototype. Since we are launching a utility token, the most important thing is that someone buying the token is able to use it on the platform. Otherwise it&rsquo;s not a utility token. Besides, currently we are in the phase that we are looking for investors willing to invest long term, with belief in our ideas and those who are able to help us scale the platform.</p><p><b>How is the landscape of blockchain-related startups changing and how does it affect Hiway?</b></p><p>I think that we are slowly moving towards a landscape in which the companies that promised to change a lot are almost ready to launch. It will be interesting to see those projects trying to deliver their promises and if not, I could imagine quite a negative energy surrounding the industry. But as always that&rsquo;s something that is not in our reach to change, so it would be a waste of time to focus on it. Crypto is a very flexible market. All new, so I think it&rsquo;s needed to keep watching all innovations and adapt when the market needs us to adapt.</p><p><b>According to your roadmap, the Hiway prototype had to be delivered in Q3 2018. Why has it not happened yet?</b></p><p>While we were building the prototype we ended up building already more than we thought we would. So we changed the plan from prototype &#8216;look and feel&#8217;, into a prototype were we could on-board freelancers and clients so that we can start building a user-base. Being who we are, we wanted to do this with the quality standard we ask ourselves and therefore needing a bit more time. Quality over quantity, so to say.</p><p><b>You are working towards removing the need to trust third parties, but you keep data in a central database that you control. How does that fit in with each other?</b></p><p>Although all data is centralized (because of the need for a fast platform), the hashes of the data will be stored on the blockchain. So only the parties working together will be in control for as long as they made the contract.</p><p>_____</p><h2 data-param="1" id="new-concepts">New concepts</h2><p>Two of the new concepts Hiway is offering are: quality jury and job value reserve. Quality jury is there to ensure no substandard work is being done, and serve as mediators to resolve any disagreements. Job value reserve, meanwhile, represents an automated system that will increase the amount of WAY tokens paid to a freelancer when the token price declines and will decrease the amount of tokens paid when prices inflate. Instead of a worker losing out due to price movements, they should always receive fair compensation for the work they do. Initially, the platform will accept dollars and euros. </p><p>The founder explained that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite difficult to find a way to make sure people keep the same amount of fiat reward when a token would fluctuate&rdquo; while their system of the reserve is &ldquo;the most interesting solution.&rdquo;</p><p>However, he stressed that before this will be live, there will be a lot of testing and running different scenarios to know how it will all work out, &ldquo;but we feel that we are on the right track.&rdquo;</p><p>Talking about the jury system, Rikmenspoel said that it &ldquo;will always be &#8216;pooled&#8217; from people/users from the same industry, with a specific rating in different aspects of their profile. Helping the system will grant them a bonus, both in rating online as well as a financial reward.&rdquo;</p>

However, in unrealized losses, they have around USD 25 million &#8211; although the gain more than makes up for it. Joining Filecoin are <b>Golem</b>, &ldquo;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/airbnb-for-computers-announces-the-big-step-1553.htm">AirBnB for computers</a>&rdquo;, with an estimate of around USD 20 million in realized gains and unrealized gains of more than USD 70 million, while <b>DigixDAO</b>, a smart assets company, only has unrealized gains &#8211; but more than USD 95 million of those.</p><h2 data-param="1" id="here-are-top-20-icos-by-total-loss-from-change-in-value-of-eth-holdings-usd-million">Here are top 20 ICOs by total loss from change in value of ETH holdings, USD million</h2><figure><img src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" sizes="(min-width: 640px) 720px, 100vw" alt="" class="content-img lazyload" data-src="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bb/237a934798.png" data-srcset="https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/1/5bb/237a934798.png 300w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/2/5bb/237a934798.png 600w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/3/5bb/237a934798.png 720w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/4/5bb/237a934798.png 900w, https://cimg.co/w/articles-attachments/0/5bb/237a934798.png 1339w"><figcaption>Source: Ethereum Blockchain, BitMEX Research, TokenAnalyst, Token Data, Price data from Etherscan</figcaption></figure><p><b>Sirin Labs</b>, a developer of blockchain-based smartphones and computers, leads the list with losses, with more than USD 40 million total lost. <b>Status</b>, a mobile Ethereum operating system, and <b>Fusion</b>, a cryptofinance platform, are two more ICOs that have lost more than USD 30 million. <b>Monetha</b>, a blockchain-based platform that aims to provide &#8220;universal/transferable trust&#8221; for the e-commerce industry, is an interesting example: although it has more than USD 10 million in unrealized losses, it also has more than USD 5 million in realized gains.

However, the blog post by BitMEX concludes that, &ldquo;the &lsquo;panic sell&rsquo; thesis is either false or will only occur to a lesser extent than some expect.&rdquo; Also, an earlier research showed that &ldquo;smaller ICO projects present a higher risk for panic selling of their ether holdings,&rdquo; as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ether-firesale-sale-risk-comes-from-small-icos-research-2501.htm">previously reported.</a> </p><p>Moreover, BitMEX stressed that a number of the ICOs will not deliver on these promises in spite of gains: &ldquo;In our view, the level of accountability in some of these ICOs is low, for instance even obtaining information about the amount raised, which currencies the raise occurred in, which Ethereum addresses are used and if the funds are spent/sold or not, can be challenging. Therefore fruits of these investments may disappoint in our view.&rdquo;</p><p>The researchers also noted that many of these projects are competing over the same scarce resources, developers. </p><p>&#8220;One could argue that the volume of capital obtained by these ICOs could inflate the cost of these resources (perhaps the less experienced developers). This may not only plague the crypto-currency ecosystem with higher costs, but also to some extent some startups in the wider technology industry, for many years,&#8221; they concluded.</p>

This is a sector in which Korean companies can really thrive.&rdquo;</p><p>Another regional governor, Lee Chul-woo of North Gyeongsang province, has also stated his keenness to build a Zug-style, ICO-friendly &ldquo;Crypto Valley.&rdquo;</p><p>Leading academics have also voiced their support of ending the ICO ban, with professors Ha Tae-hyung of Suwon University and Yoon Soon-deok of Hansei University calling for the government to legalize ICOs. Per Business Post, the professors told a parliamentary select committee that they believed ICOs should be issued in special, regulated zones within the country, or to follow the American lead on ICO issuance in order to let the blockchain industry &ldquo;evolve.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, in an editorial for the Electronic Times, journalist Jang Ji-young called on the South Korean government to follow Israel&rsquo;s lead in blockchain policy-related matters. Jang said that the ICO ban has forced South Korean blockchain startups to relocate abroad, and accused the government&rsquo;s policy of allowing over USD 27 billion to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; to overseas exchanges as a result of its blockchain-and cryptocurrency-related regulations.</p>
