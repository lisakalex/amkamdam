<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK-based crypto infrastructure firm Ramp Network is setting up shop in Ireland as its European base. It joins a growing number of cryptocurrency firms choosing Ireland for their European headquarters.</p>
<p>Steven Eisenhauer, Ramp&#8217;s chief risk and compliance officer, told the Irish Independent in an interview published Sunday that <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/we-dont-plan-to-be-netflix-fodder-uk-crypto-firm-says-central-bank-has-found-sweet-spot-for-currency-trade/a646745903.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ireland is a premier choice for crypto firms</span></a> as the sector awaits a regulatory framework to oversee the industry.</p>
<p>“Building consumer trust is the big thing for us because trust has been hurt in this industry unfortunately,” he said. Ireland, despite its size, has become a significant player with roughly 12 registered virtual asset service providers, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would estimate that half of the crypto firms looking to set up in advance of MICA [EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation] are looking at Ireland. It’s really down to Ireland, France, a little in Germany and perhaps Belgium,” he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been some sensationalized stories that make for great Netflix documentaries but we don&#8217;t plan to be one of those,” he added.</p>
<h2>Ramp Praises Central Bank of Ireland&#8217;s Crypto Approach</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ramp Network is a British fintech startup, aiming to bridge the gap between crypto and fiat currency. Its global reach spans over 150 countries and territories, allowing users to convert their euros, dollars and other fiat currencies into a wide range of crypto assets.</p>
<p>It has also secured Irish registration as a virtual asset services provider, with the ability to establish payment rails there. According to Eisenhauer, opting for Ireland as Ramp&#8217;s EU headquarters was about seeking out genuine regulators rather than evading regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>He remarked that engagements with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) had been positive, collaborative, and amicable. Eisenhauer highlighted the Central Bank&#8217;s ability to strike a balance: being accommodating to businesses while upholding their integrity and independence. This ensures that obtaining registration feels genuinely legitimate.</p>
<p>He mentioned that the CBI had traditionally been perceived as more rigorous compared to other regulatory bodies. However, the CBI has made efforts to hire personnel with firsthand experience in cryptocurrencies. According to him, there is a noticeable improvement in the CBI&#8217;s understanding of crypto. Unlike other regulators, they&#8217;ve onboarded experts who comprehend the industry&#8217;s nuances.</p>
<h2>Ireland Loses Web3 Firm as Circle Chooses US Relocation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, not all companies in the crypto sector share this sentiment. In May, reports revealed that stablecoin issuer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/circle-plans-us-transition-legal-oprations-leaving-ireland-base.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Circle intended to transfer its legal headquarters</span></a> from Ireland to the US. A spokesperson verified to Cryptonews that Circle&#8217;s parent company had submitted necessary documentation to the High Court of the Republic of Ireland for the company&#8217;s relocation to the US.</p>
<p>Such occurrences are typically rare, as many companies typically gravitate towards Ireland for its favorable business environment and low tax rates. Its corporate tax rate is a mere 12.5%, significantly lower than most other European countries.</p>
<p>Last year, crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-chooses-ireland-as-main-european-hub-as-regulatory-pressure-continues-us.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase selected Ireland as its base for operations in the EU</span></a> under the upcoming MiCA regulations. This decision was influenced by Ireland&#8217;s reputation for being friendly towards fintech businesses and its well-regarded regulatory body.</p>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States President Donald Trump is ramping up his advocacy for cryptocurrency, now setting his sights on becoming the &#8220;crypto president.&#8221;</p>
<p>He <span data-preserver-spaces="true">made the comment</span> during a fundraising event in San Francisco, co-hosted by Craft Ventures&#8217; general partner, David Sacks, and tech billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya, according to a recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pitches-himself-crypto-president-san-francisco-tech-fundraiser-2024-06-07/">Reuters report</a>.</p>
<p>At this gathering, Trump purportedly affirmed his commitment to cryptocurrency, asserting his readiness to champion the industry&#8217;s advancement, while cautioning against the Democratic Party&#8217;s purported inclination towards stringent regulations.</p>
<p>The fundraising event proved to be a significant boon for Donald Trump&#8217;s promotional efforts, reportedly netting a substantial $12 million in support ahead of the November 5 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<h2>Trump&#8217;s Crypto Support Comes in Contrast to Biden</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Donald Trump&#8217;s embrace of cryptocurrency aligns with his broader strategy to distinguish himself from the policies espoused by the current administration, particularly in light of President Joe Biden&#8217;s recent decision that drew ire from the crypto community.</p>
<p>Just a week prior, Biden faced criticism after vetoing a resolution aimed at overturning the controversial U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121.</p>
<p>This bulletin, which mandates institutions holding cryptocurrency assets to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets, has been a point of contention within the industry.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s vocal support for cryptocurrency is not new, as evidenced by several recent public statements.</p>
<p>On May 26, he reiterated his stance that the United States must assert its <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/i-am-very-positive-and-open-minded-to-cryptocurrency-trump.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">dominance in the crypto sector</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place,&#8221; he said at the time in a post on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by Trump Media and Technology Group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he has recently announced that his presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations.</p>
<p>The fundraising page, which allows eligible individuals to donate in crypto using Coinbase Commerce, displays logos for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Shiba, XRP, USD Coin, SOL, and 0x (ZRX).</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-vows-to-pardon-silk-road-creator-ross-ulbricht-if-re-elected.htm">Trump also <span data-preserver-spaces="true">made a promise</span></a> to grant a presidential pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, if he is re-elected in November’s election.</p>
<h2>Voters Consider Candidates’ Stance on Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As reported, a survey conducted by the Harris Poll has revealed that <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/one-third-of-u-s-voters-prioritize-political-candidates-stance-on-crypto-harris-poll-finds.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">one in three voters</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the US consider a candidate’s position on cryptocurrencies before making their voting decision.</span></p>
<p>Another survey conducted by leading crypto venture capital firm Paradigm reveals that Trump’s poll numbers for the 2024 US Presidential Election enjoy significant support from the crypto community.</p>
<p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://policy.paradigm.xyz/writing/March-2024-Polling" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">survey</span></a>, which included 1,000 registered voters, found that 48% of crypto owners plan to vote for the former president, while 39% intend to vote for current U.S. President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Likewise, a recent report from Coinbase claimed that <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-california-voters-favor-pro-crypto-candidates-in-2024-elections.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">California voters who own cryptocurrencies</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are expected to have a significant impact on the 2024 elections.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the &#8216;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-regulator-establish-standards-for-issuance-distribution-of-crypto.htm">Virtual Asset User Protection Act</a>&#8216; set to take effect on July 19, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has issued new guidelines detailing when non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/nft/a-beginner-s-guide-to-nfts-what-you-should-know/">NFTs</a>) should be considered virtual assets.</p>
<p>Under the new guidelines, general NFTs traded for content collection purposes will remain outside the scope of virtual assets. However, NFTs exhibiting characteristics akin to virtual assets will be subject to the same regulations. Businesses issuing such NFTs must report their operations to authorities as virtual asset businesses, local outlet <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/?5442047">News1 reported</a> earlier today.</p>
<h2>What Qualifies NFT As Virtual Asset?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Key criteria for NFTs to be classified as virtual assets include mass issuance, divisibility, and usage as a payment means. Specifically, NFTs issued in large quantities or series, thus diminishing their uniqueness, will fall under the virtual asset category.</p>
<p>The FSC highlighted that this classification targets NFTs where the primary intent is market profit rather than collection.</p>
<p>Divisible NFTs, or those that can be broken into smaller units, also lose their uniqueness and thus qualify as virtual assets.</p>
<p>Moreover, NFTs used directly or indirectly as a means of payment for goods or services, or exchanged between unspecified persons, are considered virtual assets.</p>
<p>The FSC underscored that NFTs issued solely for the purpose of being exchanged for another virtual asset would be classified as virtual assets. This does not apply to NFTs purchased with virtual assets on marketplaces.</p>
<h2>Businesses Dealing with NFTs Must Comply With the &#8216;Specific Financial Information Act’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Jeon Yo-seop, head of the Financial Innovation Planning Division at the FSC, explained that these measures are intended to prevent the misuse of NFTs as exchange notes to circumvent virtual asset regulations.</p>
<p>He emphasized that the FSC will judge the nature of NFTs strictly, without broad interpretations that could dilute regulatory effectiveness.</p>
<p>Businesses handling NFTs must scrutinize these guidelines to determine if their NFTs qualify as virtual assets. If they do, businesses must comply with the &#8216;Specific Financial Information Act,&#8217; which covers the sale, exchange, transfer, storage, and brokerage of virtual assets. Failure to report as a virtual asset business operator could result in criminal penalties.</p>
<p>For businesses uncertain about their NFTs&#8217; classification, the FSC offers consultation services. Jeon noted that the Commission will provide examples and case judgments to assist businesses in navigating these new regulations.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <span style="font-weight: 400">new study</span> shows a <a href="https://hub.easycrypto.com/consumer-research-report">surge in interest in crypto among New Zealanders</a>, with nearly half of them looking to crypto to build wealth instead of real estate. The research, conducted by Protocol Theory and Easy Crypto, suggests many Kiwis are turning to crypto due to frustrations with traditional financial systems.</p>
<p>Over a third of investors indicated they&#8217;re drawn to crypto because it cuts out banks and other institutions. They view these as roadblocks to their financial goals.</p>
<p>The survey results also showed that most people believe they can invest in crypto a bit at a time. On the other hand, only a small portion feel the same about real estate. This highlights the idea that crypto is seen as more accessible than real estate, due to the high costs associated with getting into the property market.</p>
<p>“For many Kiwis, the dream of home ownership is becoming increasingly unattainable,” said Janine Grainger, CEO at Easy Crypto. “With younger generations facing financial challenges unless they inherit wealth, and older generations looking to bolster their retirement, cryptocurrency is gaining cross-generational appeal.”</p>

<h2>Survey Reveals Soaring Interest Despite Knowledge Gaps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
New Zealand is seeing a boom in crypto use, with ownership reaching a record high. Of over 1,000 respondents, 14% now or previously owned crypto, up from 10% in 2022. Meanwhile, 45% said they&#8217;re considering investing in the future.</p>
<p>For many, the aspiration of owning a home in New Zealand clashes with their present economic circumstances. Concurrently, cryptocurrency is gaining wider acceptance, even among institutional investors.</p>
<p>Despite the surge in interest, 72% of those who haven&#8217;t invested yet say they&#8217;re confused and unsure where to begin.</p>
<p>Difficulty understanding the information (67%) and lack of reliable guidance (67%) were the main roadblocks, and interestingly, even existing investors reported facing these same issues.</p>
<p>This suggests a need for clearer information and better education around cryptocurrency to bridge the gap between interest and investment.</p>
<p>Notably, half of those surveyed want regulations on how crypto providers operate.</p>
<h2>New Zealand Government to Revamp Crypto Regulations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In April, NZ’s Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-zealand-minister-calls-for-overhaul-of-digital-asset-regulations-urging-support-for-crypto-industry.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400">called for a revamp of regulations</span></a> and support for the industry&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>Andrew Bayly voiced apprehension regarding the slow uptake of crypto, urging government assistance in nurturing the sector and establishing suitable regulations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-zealand-begins-plans-to-introduce-cbdc.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Reserve Bank is also exploring a central bank digital currency</span></a> (CBDC). This suggests that New Zealand is taking a comprehensive approach to digital assets, looking to foster innovation while managing risks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/saudi-arabia-metaverse-initiative-launches-to-celebrate-cultural-heritage.htm">Saudi Arabia</a> has joined the mBridge project to enhance cross-border payments using central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202406/09/WS66655323a31082fc043cba33.html#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia%20has%20joined%20mBrideg,between%20China%20and%20Saudi%20Arabia.">recent report by China Daily</a>, the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) has announced plans to join the mBridge initiative as a full participant, which could pave the way for increased local currency transactions in oil trade between China and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>mBridge Platform to Initiate MVP Stage</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Project mBridge is an international digital currency platform initiated by the Bank for International Settlements. The founding central banks are the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China, and the Bank of Thailand.</p>
<p>According to a BIS announcement, the mBridge project has now achieved the minimum viable product (MVP) stage. This milestone invites private sector firms to propose new solutions and applications to further develop the platform and demonstrate its full potential.</p>
<p>The report indicated that the MVP stage signified that the mBridge project is now accessible to commercial banks within the six participating members for real cross-border payment use.</p>
<p>In addition to the Saudi Central Bank joining as the sixth full participant, the BIS stated that over 26 official institutions – including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Central Bank – are participating as observers.</p>
<h2>UAE&#8217;s First Cross-Border CBDC Payment</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In February, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uae-and-china-complete-first-13-6m-cross-border-cbdc-transaction.htm">United Arab Emirates</a> and China executed their first cross-border CBDC transaction with a total value of $13.6 million using digital dirham and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-chinese-bank-offer-digital-yuan-users-carbon-credit-rewards.htm">digital yuan</a>.</p>
<p>During the Central Bank of UAE’s 50th anniversary celebration, the mBridge transaction introduced the use of digital currencies in multilateral financial exchanges. UAE Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Chinese Ambassador to the UAE Zhang Yiming attended the event.</p>
<p>Mansour invited Zhang to collaborate in starting the cross-border payment and introducing the CBDC platform during the celebration, marking the initial real-time transaction following the Bridge&#8217;s phase one pilot in 2022.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean lawmakers may “abolish” a new crypto <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-taxes/">tax</a> law, six months before it even comes into force.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/article/202406083031i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hanguk Kyungjae</a>, the National Assembly Legislative Research Service mentioned the possible crypto tax “abolition” debate in the latest edition of the National Assembly Legislative Policy Guidebook.</p>
<h2>South Korean Lawmakers Could Delay or Do Away With Crypto Tax Law</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
MPs are set to vote on proposals that would scrap a proposed tax on gold investment. However, some have argued that such a move would discriminate against investors in other assets like stocks and crypto. The guidebook’s authors noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[MPs] must decide whether and when to implement the virtual asset income taxation system in conjunction with their discussions [about] gold investment tax.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Legislative Research Service noted that some believe “virtual assets are investment-focused [assets] like stocks.”</p>
<p>The service claimed that “virtual assets” are “bought and sold” much like “stocks.” It explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Lawmakers] must consider tax parity and fairness [if they] abolish the gold investment tax. It could be argued that [the crypto tax] should also be postponed or abolished.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Lawmakers have previously voted to delay the launch of a flat-rate 20% tax levy on crypto-related “income” of over 2.5 million won (around $1,810) per year.</p>

<h2>MPs Under Pressure to Delay or Cancel Crypto Tax</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="http://bill https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-govt-to-completely-review-crypto-tax-law.htm">much-maligned</a> “crypto tax” was first voted into law at the start of the decade. But the tax proved divisive in the assembly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-ruling-party-squabbles-over-crypto-tax.htm">from the very outset</a>.</p>
<p>It was initially intended to come into force in January 2022. But lawmakers decided to delay it by a year in late 2021.</p>
<p>Instead of coming into force on January 2023, however, political parties then agreed to postpone the launch until 2025.</p>
<p>Early this year, President Yoon Suk-yeol’s People’s Power Party promised voters it would delay the rollout for two further years if it performed well in April’s legislative elections.</p>
<p>The party was roundly defeated on April 10. However, politicians have found themselves under fresh pressure to ditch the tax regardless.</p>
<p>In January, a senior Ministry of Economy and Finance official said the National Assembly should “discuss” whether it should ditch the tax.</p>
<p>The official said lawmakers should consider including crypto on a list of tax-free financial investments.</p>
<p>As it stands, the law would require crypto traders to start logging their profits on January 1, 2025. They would then need to report and pay taxes on these profits by May of the following year.</p>

<h2>‘Investment Parity Needed,’ Say Crypto Enthusiasts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
South Korean domestic investment has been sluggish <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/bok/journl/v14y2008i1p1-41.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for decades</a>, with many investors preferring to dabble in overseas investment and crypto.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Foreign buyers up, domestic sellers down in Korean stock market<a href="https://t.co/UEcd7EWsHK">https://t.co/UEcd7EWsHK</a> <a href="https://t.co/URuo2MwzBO">pic.twitter.com/URuo2MwzBO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) <a href="https://twitter.com/koreatimescokr/status/1757811949771850143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The administration of former President Moon Jae-in took a harder line on this, insisting that “where there is income, there should be taxation.”</p>
<p>But Yoon’s administration has instead sought to loosen the pressure on investors, possibly hoping that this will spark growth.</p>
<p>Crypto investors say the tax is unfair, as its thresholds are much lower than those for domestic stock market traders.</p>
<p>With just six months to go before the tax launches, experts think lawmakers will decide before the end of the current National Assembly session.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web3 social network Friend.tech has decided to part ways with Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 network operated by Coinbase, as it prepares to migrate to its own blockchain called Friendchain.</p>
<p>The migration is being carried out in collaboration with Conduit, a blockchain infrastructure provider.</p>
<p>While no specific timeline was provided in the <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://x.com/friendtech/status/1799283480083435815" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announcement made on X</span></a>, Friend.tech assured its users that they will be kept informed about the progress of the blockchain development in the coming months.</p>
<p>The decision to migrate to Friendchain doesn&#8217;t come as a complete surprise, as Friend.tech co-founder Racer had <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/friend-tech-token-plummets-over-20-amid-co-founders-base-departure-hint.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">previously made public comments</span></a> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">hinting at</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the team&#8217;s desire to move away from Base. </span></p>
<p>Racer&#8217;s remarks had caused a 20% drop in the price of Friend.tech&#8217;s native token at the time.</p>
<h2>Users Question Friend.tech&#8217;s Plan to Migrate to New Chain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The plans to develop their own blockchain have raised questions among users who are curious about the value proposition of a social-focused chain.</p>
<p>One crypto trader, Dr. Jojipup, asked this question in response to Friend.tech&#8217;s announcement, while also expressing an interest in understanding the collaboration with Conduit.</p>
<p>Friend.tech clarified that it will utilize its native token, Friend (FRIEND), as a &#8220;fully transferable gas token.&#8221;</p>
<p>Concerns were raised about potential higher gas fees on Friendchain compared to Base, which is often referred to as a &#8220;low-cost&#8221; Ethereum Layer 2 solution.</p>
<p>However, despite these concerns, the announcement sparked interest among traders, leading to a significant spike in the price of Friend immediately afterward.</p>
<p>Within just 20 minutes of the announcement, the price of Friend surged by 64%, reaching $1.31.</p>
<p>However, the price quickly retreated to $0.89 within the hour, as reported by CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this significant price fluctuation comes just a month after Friend.tech launched the token, accompanied by a major airdrop.</p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of the Friend.tech airdrop on May 3, a sizable holder known as &#8220;Murphys1d&#8221; sold over 55,000 of the newly-issued Friend tokens.</p>
<h2>Friend.tech’s Popularity Sees Uptick After Decline</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Friend.tech, launched on August 10, 2023, has become one of the top decentralized applications (dApps) on the Base layer, attracting over 200,000 users and facilitating a trading volume exceeding $230 million.</p>
<p>The platform uniquely converts user influence into tradable tokens known as “keys,” allowing users to gain access to a creator’s attention or influence.</p>
<p>The model has attracted not only cryptocurrency influencers but also NBA players and esports personalities, broadening its appeal beyond the crypto space.</p>
<p>One significant factor contributing to Friend.tech’s popularity was the hype surrounding the Base network, a Layer 2 solution associated with Coinbase.</p>
<p>The involvement of Paradigm, an investment firm connected to <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></a>, further increased confidence in Friend.tech’s potential.</p>
<p>However, the platform has also faced privacy concerns, particularly regarding the potential for user doxxing due to the link between Twitter profiles and Ethereum addresses.</p>
<p>Friend.tech has addressed these concerns by clarifying that the information deemed leaked was actually from their public API, showcasing the platform’s open nature while also highlighting the importance of user caution in protecting personal information.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Friend.tech has seen an uptick in popularity as of late.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://dune.com/tk-research/friendtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dune analytics dashboard</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the project raked in more than $500,000 in revenue on May 3.</span></p>
<p>This came as its revenue had recently fallen to under $20,000 over the past couple of months.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Notcoin was trading near $0.0188, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $785 million. Notcoin has dropped nearly 4.50% in the past 24 hours, reflecting some bearish sentiment in the market.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/">cryptonews.com</a>, Notcoin currently ranks #55 among cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of $1.95 billion. The circulating supply stands at 102 billion NOT coins.</p>
<p>As traders seek insights into Notcoin&#8217;s future movements, the focus shifts to key technical indicators and support and resistance levels that could influence its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/">price prediction</a>.</p>
<p>Will Notcoin manage to recover, or will it continue its downward trend?</p>
<h2>Notcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Notcoin (NOT) is currently trading at $0.01883. It has recently completed a 50% Fibonacci retracement at around the $0.0170 level, which is an important technical indicator for traders.</p>
<p>The Fibonacci retracement tool helps identify potential reversal levels by measuring the peak-to-trough move of an asset.</p>
<p>In this case, the formation of a Doji candle at the 50% retracement level suggests market indecision, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance for Notcoin is found at $0.01895, where the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is also positioned.</p>
<p>This means that the price might struggle to move above this level without significant buying pressure.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="📊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Daily Technical Outlook: Notcoin (NOT/USDT) &#8211; June 9, 2024<br />NOT trading at $0.01883. Key support at $0.01703 with potential bullish reversal. Immediate resistance at $0.01895. RSI at 43.37 suggests oversold conditions. Consider buying above $0.01700. Monitor closely! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Notcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Notcoin</a> <a href="https://t.co/AmCgfYGP4u">pic.twitter.com/AmCgfYGP4u</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) <a href="https://twitter.com/forex_arslan/status/1799789089505624400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If Notcoin can surpass this resistance, the next levels to watch are $0.01998 and $0.02361. On the downside, immediate support is at $0.01703, with additional support levels at $0.01408 and $0.01194, which could serve as potential buying zones if the price declines.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 43.37. The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements, indicating whether an asset is overbought or oversold.</p>
<p>An RSI below 50 generally suggests a neutral market stance but leaning towards being oversold, which might favor buyers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current technical outlook for Notcoin suggests buying above $0.01700, with the potential for upward movement if the price surpasses the $0.01895 resistance level.</p>
<h2>Promising New Alts for Big Summer Gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Solana remains a strong contender among major tokens, but it&#8217;s not the only one with potential for impressive gains. A <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">variety of new meme tokens</a> are gaining momentum in their presales, and one of the most promising is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme token that has raised over $3 million so far.</p>
<p>Sealana adopts a unique gun-toting, Trump-supporting seal as its mascot, aiming to become the next big Solana-based meme coin.</p>
<p>The project has successfully garnered significant interest, with its official X account now boasting over 8,000 followers. This growing online community is a strong indicator of future support and potential gains post-listing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NEW SOLANA MEMECOIN THAT CAN 100X!!

<p>Interestingly, Sealana has also launched an Ethereum version of its token, enhancing its applicability across the two largest layer-one networks. Investors can participate in the presale through the official Sealana website, with 1 SEAL priced at $0.022.</p>
<p>This price is expected to increase significantly once the token lists on exchanges, potentially making it one of the best-performing new launches of the year.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is currently trading at $69,300, showing a modest increase of less than 0.10%. However, a recent tweet from millionaire trader Zoran Kole (@Captain_Kole1) has stirred the market.

<h2>Millionaire Trader Says BTC Will Fall to $40,000 Level</h2>

Millionaire trader Zoran Kole, known on Twitter as @Captain_Kole1, posted a cryptic tweet mentioning &#8220;$44,444,&#8221; referencing Bitcoin&#8217;s yearly opening price.</p>
<p>His terse apology, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; suggests a bearish outlook, implying that Bitcoin might revisit or fall below this level. This tweet has sparked concern among investors and traders, as it hints at a potential significant price drop from its current trading levels around $69,300.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is currently trading at $69,300, showing a modest increase of less than 0.10%.

<p>However, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $69,600 and $69,750, with further resistance at $70,650. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), positioned at $69,600, is a critical level that Bitcoin needs to surpass to confirm a bullish trend.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin struggles with market volatility, innovative projects like PlayDoge (PLAY) are gaining traction.</p>
<h2>Promising New Meme Tokens for Potential Gains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Traders seeking quick, substantial gains might consider newer alternatives, such as tokens in presales. One promising token is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/playdoge/">PlayDoge (PLAY)</a>, an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency currently in its presale phase. So far, it has raised $3.33 million out of its $3.74 million goal.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PlayDoge New 10X Potential Play to Earn MEME Utility Token (Best Crypto to Buy Now?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLvTFi4aMIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>PlayDoge’s appeal lies in its Doge-themed Tamagotchi-style game with crypto-enabled play-to-earn mechanics. Players can breed, trade, and take their virtual Shiba Inu dogs on missions, earning PLAY tokens with a maximum supply of 9.4 billion. The current presale price is $0.00505 per token.</p>
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funds Raised:</strong> $3.33 million</li>
<li><strong>Token Supply:</strong> 9.4 billion PLAY</li>
</ul>
<p>More game details will emerge soon, but interested investors can participate in the presale on the PlayDoge website. Early investment is advantageous as the presale price increases with each stage, potentially leading to significant gains once the game launches and PLAY tokens are listed on exchanges.</p>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in terms of daily trading volume, has reached a significant milestone of 200 million global users.</p>
<p>On June 8, the exchange <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://x.com/binance/status/1799475255838462273" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">took to its social media channels</span></a> to celebrate the achievement and framed the 200 million user mark as a stepping stone towards their ambitious goal of onboarding one billion users, approximately one in every eight people on Earth.</p>
<p>The claim of having the highest number of users among exchanges is yet to be independently verified, but it is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement for the platform.</p>
<h2>Binance Continues to Attract New Users</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Just two years ago, in 2022, Binance reported a user base of around 130 million.</p>
<p>By 2023, the exchange had added 40 million more users, bringing the total count to 170 million.</p>
<p>Impressively, in the first half of 2024 alone, Binance has already added at least 30 million new users.</p>
<p>If this growth trajectory continues, the exchange is on track to reach 300 million users by 2026, assuming the industry and company trends remain consistent.</p>
<p>To put Binance&#8217;s user base into perspective, research from Triple-A indicates that the global cryptocurrency consumer installation base reached 562 million people in 2024, with an increase of 142 million users compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>This means that Binance users represent approximately 36% of the global cryptocurrency user base, highlighting the platform&#8217;s dominance in the industry.</p>
<p>In addition to the impressive user count, Binance achieved another significant milestone earlier this year.</p>
<p>In March, the company reported that it had surpassed $100 billion in user assets under custody.</p>
<p>This means that, on average, each user has around $500 worth of assets stored on the platform.</p>
<p>While Binance has faced legal challenges, including the recent imprisonment of founder and former CEO Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao on fraud charges, the exchange has managed to navigate through these obstacles relatively unscathed.</p>
<p>CZ is reportedly remorseful for his actions and is currently serving his sentence in a minimum-security facility in California.</p>
<h2>Binance Eyes Global Expansion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In May, the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) revealed that Binance has successfully <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-and-kucoin-granted-approval-by-indias-anti-money-laundering-unit.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">registered with the regulatory body</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, returning to the country after some regulatory hurdles. </span></p>
<p>Prior to that, the exchange announced that it had <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-binance-secures-operating-license-in-dubai-heres-the-latest.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">obtained a license from Dubai’s regulator</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, VARA, enabling the platform to cater to retail clients along with qualified and institutional ones.</span></p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the licensing process involved Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, relinquishing voting control of the Dubai unit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, earlier this year, Binance <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-launches-digital-asset-exchange-in-thailand-in-collaboration-with-gulf-innova.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">unveiled its joint venture crypto exchange Binance Thailand</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which comes in collaboration with Gulf Innova, a subsidiary of Gulf Energy Development.</span></p>
<p>Binance Thailand, abbreviated as Binance TH, provides a platform for digital asset exchange services with Thai baht trading pairs.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Binance has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide.</p>
<p>Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance for allegedly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading federal laws.</p>
<p>Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">charged Binance Holdings LTD and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker exchanges, clearing houses, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.</span></p>

<p>Despite this decline, the coin has attracted considerable attention in the cryptocurrency space, particularly in 2023, when it outpaced many altcoins in trading volume.</p>
<p>This strong performance propelled Pepe into the top 10 cryptocurrencies in weekly and monthly trading activity reviews.</p>
<p>Currently, Pepe is priced at $0.000013, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,966,755,000, and has dropped nearly 10% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>With a market rank of #22 and a live <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/">market capitalization</a> of $5,521,137,693, the focus now shifts to the factors influencing its price, including speculations on whether whales are buying the dip.</p>
<h2>How US Economic Data and Fed Rate Speculations Impacted Pepe&#8217;s Price Decline</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pepe&#8217;s recent price decline can be attributed to several factors, including stronger-than-expected U.S. job data indicating a robust labour market. This development has potentially delayed anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, leading to cautious investor sentiment and affecting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, including Pepe.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin&#8217;s decline of over 2.5% to around $69,156 has further dampened investor sentiment, impacting the broader cryptocurrency market and contributing to Pepe&#8217;s price drop. Despite its strong past performance, Pepe has seen significant declines recently, reflecting the overall bearish trend in the crypto market.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strong U.S. jobs data delays Fed rate cut expectations.</li>
<li>Investor caution impacts risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies.</li>
<li>Bitcoin&#8217;s decline exacerbates negative sentiment in the crypto market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pepe&#8217;s price reflects these broader market trends and economic factors, highlighting the interconnectedness of economic data and cryptocurrency performance.</p>
<h2>Internal Metrics Affecting Pepe&#8217;s Price Trajectory</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pepe&#8217;s price trajectory has also been influenced by internal metrics, beyond external market factors. In June, the ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit saw a decline, suggesting a shift in market sentiment. This reduction in bullishness led to decreased social media engagement, highlighting a drop in hype around Pepe.</p>
<p>Despite achieving significant market cap milestones and attracting major investors, concerns about Pepe&#8217;s intrinsic value and regulatory challenges have persisted. These factors contribute to the uncertainty surrounding its long-term growth prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Decline in on-chain transaction volume in profit.</li>
<li>Reduced social media engagement indicating less hype.</li>
<li>Ongoing concerns about intrinsic value and regulatory challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pepe&#8217;s price reflects these internal metrics, emphasizing the importance of market sentiment and investor confidence in its future performance.</p>
<h2>Pepe Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/pepe/">Pepe (PEPE)</a> is currently trading at $0.000013, and immediate resistance levels identified at $0.00001417, $0.00001453, and $0.00001502, suggesting areas where selling pressure could intensify if prices attempt to rise.</p>
<p>Conversely, support levels are noted at $0.00001204, $0.00001103, and $0.00000988, which could serve as potential buying zones if the decline continues.</p>
<figure id="attachment_223983" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223983" style="width: 1778px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-223983 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08194215/1717875735-pepe.jpg" alt="Pepe Coin Price Chart " width="1778" height="893" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08194215/1717875735-pepe.jpg 1778w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08194215/1717875735-pepe-300x151.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08194215/1717875735-pepe-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08194215/1717875735-pepe-768x386.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08194215/1717875735-pepe-1536x771.jpg 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08194215/1717875735-pepe-150x75.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1778px) 100vw, 1778px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223983" class="wp-caption-text">Pepe Coin Price Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 29.80, indicating oversold conditions that may hint at a potential reversal. However, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), positioned at $0.00001471, remains a strong resistance level that PEPE needs to overcome to change its bearish outlook.</p>
<p>The appearance of a bearish engulfing candle further suggests that the downtrend may persist, highlighting the importance of monitoring these technical indicators closely.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the market sentiment for Pepe remains bearish, particularly as it trades below the $0.00001300 pivot point.</p>
<h2>Alternative Meme Tokens for Big Rallies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Traders looking for quick, significant gains might consider newer alternatives, including tokens in presales. One promising token is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/playdoge/" rel="sponsored nofollow">PlayDoge (PLAY)</a>, an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that recently opened its presale, raising $0.93 million of its $1.38 million goal.</p>
<p>PlayDoge’s appeal lies in its Doge-themed Tamagotchi-style game with crypto-enabled play-to-earn mechanics. Players can breed, trade, and take their virtual Shiba Inu dogs on missions, earning PLAY tokens with a maximum supply of 9.4 billion. The current presale price is $0.00501 per token.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PlayDoge New 10X Potential Play to Earn MEME Utility Token (Best Crypto to Buy Now?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLvTFi4aMIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li>Current Status: $0.93 million raised</li>
<li>Token Supply: 9.4 billion PLAY</li>
</ul>
<p>More game details will emerge soon, but interested parties can participate in the presale on the PlayDoge website. Early investment is advantageous as the presale price increases with each stage, potentially leading to significant gains once the game launches and lists on exchanges.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the founder of Binance </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/31/binances-ex-ceo-changpeng-zhao-begins-prison-sentence-in-southern-california.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">begins his federal prison sentence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of 4 months, the US Government’s newly approved infrastructure for the Binance crypto ecosystem is reigning supreme. The BNB coin has hit a new All-time High, just after the launch of the token presale for “Bitnance ($BTN)”, the BEP-20 alternative to Bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What is Binance (BNB) Coin’s All-Time High?</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">The new ATH for $BNB coin is now $720.67 [USD]. This was set yesterday, June 6th of 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prior to this, the native coin to the world’s biggest crypto exchange, would stagnant at a high of around $650 before falling back down in a correction. Twice before 2024, this has happened.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is BNB Coin Price Going Up?</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">There are numerous theories to why the price of $BNB coin is going up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The foremost obvious, traders are expecting a spot ETF approval for the Binance Coin as soon this year. After Ethereum’s approval, many expect the coins BNB, SOL, XRP, and LTC will have similar fates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden explosion in price could also be attributed to Binance’s recent </span><a href="https://www.cointribune.com/en/crypto-binance-resumes-card-purchases-a-victory-over-regulation/"><span style="font-weight: 400">resuming of credit card purchases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, at least those by Visa and Mastercard. This news broke just today, but was in the works for over a week, and could possibly indicate a whale investor getting the news earlier than the public.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitnance (BTN) Token Presale</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A third reason being hypothesized by investors is Binance-Chain’s new BEP-20 token “Bitnance ($BTN).” The token presale was launched for the blockchain’s new version of Bitcoin ($BTC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoNews, </span><a href="https://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitnance-by-binance-smart-chain-offers-an-alternative-to-bitcoin-as-a-store-of-value-presale-coming-soon"><span style="font-weight: 400">InsideBitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://icoholder.com/en/bitnance-1076825"><span style="font-weight: 400">ICOHolder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and other media publications have begun pointing out to investors that the Binance-Chain has its own store-of-value token on the horizon. It will rival Bitcoin, offering the same anti-inflation metrics to help traders retain value while fiat currency falls in value. However, with Binance-chain having little to not trading fees, it will be far cheaper to use than Bitcoins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This project is extremely attractive to investors in its initial ICO phase as well, because the current price of $0.357 is sure to double. Store-of-Value token’s price is driven by demand and the Binance Exchange is the biggest in the world.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400">How many traders use Binance?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s reported 170-million crypto traders use Binance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The top CEX administrates trading volumes that exceed $7.7-trillion dollars per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The BEP-20 network supports over 69 fiat currencies as well, making it one of (if not, the) the most viable options for cryptocurrency holders across the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Any product publicized to the gigantic audience could swing the price of the $BNB coin by association to its binance-chain but it’s the overall utility and problem-solving capabilities within its ecosystem that are fundamentally a catalyst to such growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With purchases via credit card re-approved, the new store-of-value token Bitnance (BTN) beginning to rise in popularity against Bitcoin (BTC), and a spot ETF, it’s possible the Binance Coin (BNB) could soon top $1000.</span></p>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin users are currently facing difficulties with high transaction fees as the blockchain becomes congested once more, although the cause may be different from what some might expect.</p>
<p>Data from <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">mempool</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.space</span></a>, a platform that provides information on Bitcoin transactions, reveals that a medium-priority Bitcoin transaction now costs $34.08 to be processed promptly.</p>
<p>Over 333,400 unconfirmed transactions are waiting in line for confirmation.</p>
<p>As has been the case in previous instances of high Bitcoin fees, many members of the cryptocurrency community on Twitter expressed frustration with Bitcoin&#8217;s limited transaction capacity and advocated for the adoption of more efficient layer 2 solutions and sidechains.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin miners are enjoying increased revenue due to the surge in fees, earning over double the amount of Bitcoin per block.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin hashprice is screaming toward $0.08/th as fees pump. A nice windfall for miners to end the week. <a href="https://t.co/LJ5UQiMRNA">pic.twitter.com/LJ5UQiMRNA</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Marty Bent (@MartyBent) <a href="https://twitter.com/MartyBent/status/1799134385717076174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Network Congestion Not Related to Ordinals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Surprisingly, the cause of the congestion is not related to the Ordinals or Runes protocols, which have previously driven fees to exorbitant levels.</p>
<p>CryptoQuant, a cryptocurrency analytics platform, identified OKX, a prominent crypto exchange based in Seychelles and currently the third-largest in the world by trading volume, as the main culprit behind Bitcoin&#8217;s congestion.</p>
<p>Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, explained on Twitter that OKX&#8217;s internal transactions to consolidate outputs have led to the spike in fees.</p>
<p>When users want to send Bitcoin from their wallets to another wallet, they have to pay transaction fees on each unspent transaction output (UTXO) in their wallet.</p>
<p>This can result in significant fees for large transfers.</p>
<p>Exchanges, in particular, deal with numerous small incoming transactions and large outgoing transactions.</p>
<p>To mitigate fees, exchanges consolidate their UTXOs by spending them all at once when network fees are low, combining them into larger outputs within the same wallet.</p>
<p>However, when a major exchange engages in this consolidation process, it can drive up fees across the entire network, causing inconvenience for other users.</p>
<h2>Developers Forsee Programmability as Next Catalyst for Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A group of developers <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/developers-foresee-programmability-as-catalyst-for-bitcoins-next-rally.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">believes introducing programmability to the Bitcoin</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> blockchain could drive the next rally for the largest cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p>While Bitcoin is currently seen as digital gold, with its primary use being a store of value, developers argue that the addition of programmability would unlock a range of functionalities and applications.</p>
<p>Unlike its rival Ether, which allows for the creation of smart contracts and the development of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network, the Bitcoin blockchain lacks the ability to support such features.</p>
<p>Over the years, developers have attempted to address this limitation by creating “Layer 2” networks like Lightning, aimed at scaling Bitcoin for payment applications.</p>
<p>However, many of these solutions have proven unreliable, and the associated bridges, used to transfer tokens between networks, have been susceptible to hacks, leading to user apprehension.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bakkt Holdings, the digital asset marketplace established by the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is reportedly considering a potential sale amidst a surge in crypto-related takeover activities.</p>
<p>The company has engaged the services of a financial advisor to assess various strategic options, including the possibility of a breakup, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-marketplace-bakkt-weighs-potential-sale-breakup-1.2082595" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BNN Bloomberg reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, citing sources familiar with the matter. </span></p>
<p>However, no final decision has been reached, and Bakkt may ultimately choose to remain an independent entity, the report said.</p>
<h2>Bakkt Faces Challenges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of prominent futures markets and the NYSE, initially launched Bakkt to much fanfare in 2018.</p>
<p>At the time, Bakkt announced partnerships with Starbucks Corp. and Microsoft Corp., garnering significant attention.</p>
<p>Notably, Kelly Loeffler, the founding CEO of Bakkt, went on to serve as a US Senator from Georgia for a year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Bakkt faced potential delisting from the NYSE after disclosing concerns about its ability to continue operating as a going concern.</p>
<p>Bakkt, which offers a comprehensive range of services including trading and custody, enters the market during a period of consolidation within the digital-asset sector, accompanied by a resurgence in crypto prices nearing record highs.</p>
<p>While some firms contemplate expansion, others are still grappling with the aftermath of the industry-wide meltdown experienced two years ago.</p>
<p>In recent news, Robinhood Markets Inc. announced its acquisition of the European crypto exchange Bitstamp, while Riot Platforms Inc., one of the largest Bitcoin miners, proposed a takeover of its rival, Bitfarms.</p>
<p>Bakkt went public through a merger with a blank-check vehicle in 2021.</p>
<h2>Bakkt Reports First Quarter Loss</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The company reported a first-quarter loss of $21 million on revenue of $855 million.</p>
<p>On Friday, Bakkt unveiled a partnership with Crossover Markets to develop a crypto electronic communication network (ECN), further expanding its offerings.</p>
<p>Bakkt&#8217;s possession of the coveted BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services bolsters its position in the digital-asset platform landscape.</p>
<p>Other major participants in the industry that have received clearance to conduct business in New York include crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc., stablecoin issuer Circle, and Jack Dorsey&#8217;s digital payment firm Square.</p>
<p>Following the news, Bakkt&#8217;s shares experienced a 15% surge, reaching $22.33 on Friday.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, the stock has witnessed a 27% increase, leading to a current market valuation of approximately $300 million.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that the stock has faced a decline of around 30% over the past year.</p>
<p>In November 2023, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-bakkt-reveals-international-and-domestic-expansion-justin-sun-offers-5-bounty-metaverse-platform-zep-to-build-on-near.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bakkt Holdings announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> its expansion into </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">both</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> international and domestic markets. </span></p>
<p>The digital asset marketplace detailed its plans to extend cryptocurrency capabilities across numerous global markets, servicing both existing partnerships and new clients.</p>
<p>As reported, trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges has <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-trading-volume-declines-in-april-as-bitcoin-retreats-from-record-high.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">experienced a significant decline in April</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, coinciding with Bitcoin’s retreat from its all-time high.</span></p>
<p>Additionally, derivatives trading volume saw its first decrease in seven months, falling by 26.1% to $4.57 trillion.</p>
<p>The decline came as major CEXs like Binance <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-cexs-experience-3x-surge-in-monthly-trading-volumes-from-october-2023-bybit.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">experienced a large surge in trading volumes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> between October 2023 and March 2024.</span></p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, experienced a significant decline to an intraday low of around $68,500. This downturn coincided with &#8216;Roaring Kitty&#8217;s&#8217; YouTube livestream, which failed to invigorate the market.</p>
<p>The drop was further influenced by a stronger-than-expected non-farm payroll report for May, adding 272,000 new jobs and strengthening the US dollar.</p>
<p>This development dampened hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, impacting Bitcoin price prediction and overall market sentiment. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> and other altcoins also saw declines, contributing to the 3% drop in the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Decline After &#8216;Roaring Kitty&#8217;s&#8217; Livestream: Next Support Level?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, dropped to an intraday low of $68,507, coinciding with &#8216;Roaring Kitty&#8217;s&#8217; YouTube livestream.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event:</strong> Keith Gill, also known as &#8220;Roaring Kitty,&#8221; hosted his first livestream in three years, attracting over 600,000 viewers.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Discuss GameStop (GME.N) and its future, interspersed with jokes, memes, and disclaimers about investment risks.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Performance:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Livestream:</strong> GameStop shares surged nearly 50% after Gill announced the livestream.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Livestream:</strong> Shares dropped nearly 40% following the announcement of a $3 billion share sale and closed at $28.22 after volatile trading.</li>
<li><strong>Trading Volume:</strong> GameStop shares saw $10 billion worth of transactions, second only to Nvidia and Apple.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This event failed to boost market enthusiasm and was compounded by a robust non-farm payroll report for May, which added 272,000 new jobs and strengthened the US dollar.</p>
<p>Consequently, hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut were dampened, affecting Bitcoin price predictions and market sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins also saw declines, contributing to a 3% drop in the crypto market.</li>
<li>&#8216;Roaring Kitty&#8217; (Keith Gill) couldn&#8217;t rejuvenate interest in GameStop (GME.N), which fell nearly 40% after announcing a share sale.</li>
<li>GameStop&#8217;s decline underscores the volatility and speculative nature of financial markets, potentially impacting crypto sentiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This highlights the ongoing challenges and volatility in both the crypto and traditional financial markets.</p>

<p>The dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price was also attributed to the US NFP data, as investors reacted to stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data.</p>
<p>This data indicated a resilient labor market, potentially delaying any Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>As a result, the dollar&#8217;s value improved, dampening hopes of Bitcoin reaching an all-time high before the weekend.</p>

<li>The U.S. Labor Department reported a robust addition of 272,000 jobs in May, pushing the unemployment rate to 4.0%.</li>
<li>This unexpected strength in employment reduced expectations for near-term rate cuts, impacting risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, emerging market stocks, bonds, and commodities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data signalled a resilient labour market and delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts, leading to investor caution and contributing to Bitcoin&#8217;s decline.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is currently trading at $69,313, showing a minor increase of less than 0.10%. The key pivot point is at $68,550, a critical level where the market trend could change, and it&#8217;s keeping <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin price prediction</a> bullish.</p>

<p>Above this pivot, the outlook remains bullish. Immediate resistance levels are at $69,728, $70,643, and $71,961, where Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure. On the downside, support levels are at $67,570, $66,620, and $65,881, providing potential buying interest.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41, indicating a neutral market stance without strong buying or selling pressure. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $69,689 acts as a resistance point, suggesting it may be challenging for Bitcoin to rise above this level.</p>

<p>An upward trendline is supporting Bitcoin near the $68,500 level, reinforcing the bullish outlook. However, if Bitcoin drops below $68,556, there could be sharp selling, leading to a significant price decrease.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin struggles with market volatility, innovative projects like Wiener AI (WAI) are gaining traction.</p>
<h2>Innovative AI Meme Coin Wiener AI – Can It Outshine Competitors?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The new meme coin, Wiener AI (WAI), themed around a sausage dog, offers more than just novelty. It features <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/ai-trading-bots/">advanced AI-powered</a> trading tools, adding significant utility. Investors have already contributed $4.99 million to WAI’s presale, indicating strong interest.</p>
<p>With AI trending in the market, especially post-Nvidia’s earnings, WAI is poised for increased demand. Additionally, 20% of the total supply is allocated for staking rewards, offering an impressive 396% APY.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As per the Santiment report, 78.8% of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> tokens currently in circulation are in profit.</p>
<p>That is to say, the XRP price is higher now than when these tokens were first issued on the blockchain.</p>
<p>That’s a decent score, but still substantially lags <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin’s</a> 98.3% and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum’s</a> 95.1%.</p>
<p>The XRP price’s persistent underperformance versus other major cryptos in the last year and a half explains this.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is up just 73% from its 2022 bear market lows. As per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">CoinMarketCap</a>, it continues to trade 87% below its all-time highs, which were hit back in early 2018.</p>
<p>By comparison, Bitcoin, last in the $69,000s, has rallied 4.5x from 2022 lows and hit new record highs this year.</p>
<p>Ethereum, meanwhile, is up 4x from its 2024 lows and is now just 25% down from its 2021 record highs.</p>
<h2><strong>XRP Price Prediction – What’s Next for XRP?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The XRP price’s long-term technicals remain uninspiring and suggest a near-term catch-up to BTC and ETH is unlikely.</p>
<p>XRP broke below a long-term uptrend in April, and has since been trading bearishly.</p>

<p>If Bitcoin son surges to fresh record highs above $74,000 and Ether returns to its ATHs, XRP could pick up.</p>
<p>But chart analysis suggests a retest of support-turned-resistance around $0.40 in the coming weeks is on the cards.</p>
<p>Fundamentals suggest that a pick-up is unlikely any time soon.</p>
<p>The crypto bull market so far has strongly favored coins with strong adoption narratives.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is leading the way in wake of spot US ETF approvals. Ethereum is likely to soon hit all-time highs when its ETFs also go live in the USA.</p>

<p>And coins like Solana have seen explosive growth in users since 2023, driven by an influx of meme coin traders and airdrop hunters.</p>
<p>Coins that have seen weak/no user growth and don’t have strong adoption narratives like XRP and ADA have struggled.</p>
<p>Many analysts don’t rank XRP amongst their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-to-buy/">best cryptos to invest in right now</a>. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/xrp-price-prediction/">Long-term price predictions</a> are likely to remain bearish.</p>
<h2><strong>XRP Alternative to Consider – PlayDoge (PD)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Traders looking to invest in a stable, low risk crypto that will deliver consistent gains in the year ahead might want to consider shifting their holdings from XRP to BTC, ETH or SOL.</p>
<p>But some traders are looking for bigger gains ought to consider getting involved in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/meme-coins/">meme coin market</a>.</p>
<p>50-100x gains are possible if investors can get in early on a new meme coin before it becomes popular.</p>
<p>This is a very risky strategy, as there is no guarantee a new coin will gain traction.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Pepe (PEPE) price declines sharply amid a broad crypto market sell-off in wake of the latest US jobs figures, its investors are shifting their focus to a new ICO in the meme coin space called Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) that has big potential.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/pepe/">Pepe</a> was last trading just below $0.000013, over 10% down on the day.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/meme-coins/">meme coin</a> dipped below its 21DMA for the first time April on Friday. That’s a sign that the bears may now be in control.</p>
<p>That said, PEPE dipped all the way as low as $0.00001120 and has since bounced 14% from session lows.</p>
<p>The 50DMA (at $0.00001050) plus the March/mid-May highs around $0.11 appear to have provided strong support.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably too soon, then, to call an end to the ongoing Pepe bull market. Pepe is probably still among the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-meme-coins/">best meme coins to buy in June</a>.</p>
<p>That said, it makes sense that, with Pepe still not too far from all-time highs, investors look for alternatives.</p>
<p>Here is why they are shifting their focus to an exciting new ICO called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/basedawgz/">Base Dawgz (DAWGZ)</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>New ICO Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) – Can This New Multi-Chain Meme Coin Surpass Dogecoin?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A new Base meme coin called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/basedawgz/">Base Dawgz (DAWGZ)</a> has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews, who now rank it as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-meme-coins/">15 best meme coins to buy in June</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="CHECK OUT THIS NEW BASECHAIN PRESALE!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/icQHvpJJZ_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/basedawgz/">Base Dawgz (DAWGZ)</a> is a base jumping Shiba Inu that appears across five blockchains; Base, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">BNB</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a>.</p>
<p>Its just-launched presale has already been able to take in nearly $500,000 as buzz begins to grow.</p>
<p>And the Base Dawgz <a href="https://x.com/BaseDawgz">X account</a> has already garnered over 500 followers, while the <a href="https://t.me/BaseDawgz">Telegram</a> group already has 128.</p>
<p>Investors are advised not to wait around too long. DAWGZ is currently available at $0.00479, but that price will rise in just over 5 days.</p>
<p>New ICO DAWGZ doesn’t just come packed with cross-chain bridging powers. It is also a potential passive income gem – a staking and airdrop program are soon to be announced.</p>
<p>While gains cannot be guaranteed, DAWGZ is certainly amongst <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/base-chain-meme-coins/">the best Base chain meme coins to buy</a>.</p>
<p>Investors must always remember that all meme coins are very risky. They must do their own due diligence and understand <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-are-meme-coins/">what meme coins are and how they work</a> before investing.</p>
<p>New ICO DAWGZ will probably never surpass Dogecoin, which has a whopping market cap around $23 billion.</p>
<p>But there is no reason why this meme coin couldn’t reach a market cap in the hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>During the US session, Bitcoin fell dramatically to $69,000 following the release of stronger than expected US NFp figures.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy, known for holding a large amount of Bitcoin, is dealing with significant short positions valued at nearly $7 billion.</p>
<p>Despite a notable decline in short-seller interest, there are still over 18 active short positions against the company, as listed by Fintel’s “The Big Shorts.”</p>
<p>The decline in short positions occurs even as the company&#8217;s stock price has tripled over the past six months.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs, far surpassing the anticipated 190,000, despite high interest rates. This increase indicates a robust labor market, although the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4%. This growth was celebrated by the White House, emphasizing continued economic progress.</p>

<li><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> 4%</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> 5.25% to 5.5%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This job growth has influenced Bitcoin prices, reflecting broader economic confidence.</p>
<p>While the labor market remains strong, Wall Street is concerned about sustained high interest rates. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s upcoming meeting will address potential rate changes, with inflation currently at 3.4%, above the target of 2%.</p>
<p><strong>How Job Growth Impacts Bitcoin: </strong>The robust job growth and economic confidence have bolstered Bitcoin prices, as investors view the strong labor market as a positive sign for the economy and financial markets.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Price Stability Supported by Whale Accumulation and Long-Term Holder Interest</h2>

Long-term Bitcoin holders are showing renewed interest, with BTC whales accumulating significant amounts, leading to $1 billion in daily inflows over the past month. This demonstrates strong confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>According to CryptoQuant, there has been a notable increase in the balances of permanent holders and large investors, alongside a rise in Bitcoin purchases from spot ETFs in the USA.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 6, a cybersecurity report revealed that over 35 YouTube channels live-streamed a deepfake video of Elon Musk, promising to double crypto deposits. The scammers targeted space enthusiasts eager to watch the SpaceX starship rocket launch.</p>
<h2>SpaceX Launch DeepFakes Highlight Growing Cyber Threat</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cybersecurity experts from Avast Threat Labs revealed on X that scammers hijacked over 35 YouTube pages.</p>
<p>Investigators found that one of the dubious YouTube channels that mimicked the live-streamed SpaceX launch had 2.9 million subscribers but lacked a verification check mark. This was in contrast with the real SpaceX YouTube channel, which boasts 6.65 million subscribers and a verified check mark.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>These fake SpaceX livestreams featured wide-angle shots of Musk speaking at an outdoor event, with some of the footage blurred to make them seem authentic.</p>
<p>However, the AI-generated Elon Musk voice sounded convincing with phrases like “You have a chance to see your crypto propel exponentially as our rocket propels toward the stars” were said.</p>
<p>Mimicked vocal patterns of Musk, such as stutters, pauses, and words like “Umm” were also used at human-like intervals.</p>
<p>The video went on to explain the benefits of investing in Bitcoin and the potential profits available to savvy investors. Thereafter, the deepfake video directed viewers to scan a QR code and send cryptocurrencies to an address controlled by the thieves. The QR code remained on the screen for the entirety of the livestream.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>During the fake SpaceX crypto giveaway, viewers were told they would receive double on every crypto deposit.</p>
<p>The AI-generated Elon Musk voice stated,</p>
<p>“This is not a fake, this is a real giveaway. I personally guarantee it to you.”</p>
<p>Some SpaceX <a href="https://twitter.com/trauma_hazmat/status/1798974479223374066">enthusiasts fell</a> for the scam. Nevertheless, the number of victims and the amount of funds collected in the fake SpaceX crypto giveaway remain unknown.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>YouTube has restricted all compromised pages as they violated the platform’s terms of service.</p>
<h2>Musk Crypto Giveaway Scam Promises Rewards For Participation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This is not the first time Elon Musk will be targeted by bad actors who use his image to scam unsuspecting crypto users.</p>
<p>In October 2023, an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-elon-musk-crypto-scam-deepfake-promises-30-returns-deposits.htm">Elon Musk crypto scam deepfake promised 30% returns on deposits</a> as users were encouraged to invest in the BitVex trading platform.</p>

Quantum AI allegedly used Musk&#8217;s deepfake videos of Musk to deceive people into believing he is the brain behind the platform.</p>

<p>On-again, off-again crypto enthusiast Andrew &#8216;Top G&#8217; Tate has been having a normal one on Twitter today.</p>
<p>His Friday afternoon kicked off with Tweets that he will &#8216;crash the Solana network&#8217; and moved on to inviting his followers to send him coins that he would &#8216;diamond hands&#8217; and &#8216;never sell&#8217;.</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://x.com/Cobratate/status/1799007282870821212">promised</a> to buy &#8216;junk&#8217; coins himself &#8211; over a million dollars of any random new meme coins that were shilled to him, if he gained enough retweets on <a href="https://x.com/Cobratate">@CobraTate</a>. Those ranged from &#8216;Germany coin&#8217; to a lurid Madonna themed token.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Top G Crypto Burn</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Tate kept his promise to not sell tokens, the day took an interesting turn.</p>
<p>At one point Andrew Tate&#8217;s public wallet was gifted approximately $1 &#8211; $1.5 million worth of a new meme coin &#8216;Top G&#8217;, by Twitter handle $TOPG (<a href="https://x.com/topgsolanacto/status/1799086685046915188">@topgsolanacto</a>). That amounted to 58% of the supply.</p>
<p>The brand new account (prompting some suspicion Andrew Tate is behind Top G token) issued a challenge &#8211; to burn his holdings and &#8216;become the true Top G&#8217;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-223869 aligncenter" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07194347/1717789427-top-crypto-price-chart.jpg" alt="$TOPG price chart" width="1118" height="694" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07194347/1717789427-top-crypto-price-chart.jpg 1118w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07194347/1717789427-top-crypto-price-chart-300x186.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07194347/1717789427-top-crypto-price-chart-1024x636.jpg 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07194347/1717789427-top-crypto-price-chart-768x477.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07194347/1717789427-top-crypto-price-chart-150x93.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1118px) 100vw, 1118px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TOP G coin price chart via <a href="https://birdeye.so/token/8NH3AfwkizHmbVd83SSxc2YbsFmFL4m2BeepvL6upump?chain=solana">Birdeye</a></em></p>
<p>It then tagged widely followed crypto influencer <a href="https://x.com/blknoiz06">@blknoiz06</a> for help &#8216;if you don&#8217;t know how to burn&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Andrew Tate Responds</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
That &#8216;open letter&#8217; challenge tweet received one million impressions, and the price of $TOPG quickly pumped 700%, worth almost $11 million when Andrew Tate responded and burnt his share of the new meme coin, sending them to the SOL Incinerator.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Burnt. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Top G crypto price briefly continued to rise with its reduction in circulating supply.</p>
<p>The anonymous sender of the $TOPG tokens tweeted out the <a href="https://solscan.io/account/HDrbnUYk6MWVr51D5J1kfWBPzXCsVrcWZvoA5mqxuwdq">Solscan</a> transactions and &#8216;what&#8217;s $20 million to a billionaire&#8217;, plus a ChatGPT analysis of the token burn was bullish.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, $TOPG has retraced 80% from its all-time high earlier today and has 9.4k holders with a fully diluted market cap of $8.8 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>New Meme Coins &#8211; Best Cryptos To Buy Now?</h2>
