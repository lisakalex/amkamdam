<p>Indian think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (<a href="https://gtri.co.in/default.asp">GTRI</a>) is seeking to incorporate crypto discussions into the WTO e-commerce framework.</p>
<p>India has asked the WHO member countries to include crypto-related issues while negotiating any agreement on the e-commerce sector. The crypto market has recently garnered global attention, however, under WTO, the e-commerce framework remains ambiguous, the think tank noted.</p>
<p>GTRI suggested during a meeting involving senior officials of the World Trade Organization (<a href="https://www.wto.org/">WTO</a>) members in Geneva last week.</p>
<p>According to GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava, the &ldquo;multifaceted dynamics of the e-commerce landscape&rdquo; pave for a significant global digital trade.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The inclusion or exclusion of cryptocurrencies and the diverse positions of influential nations will shape the future of international e-commerce policies.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The member nations of WTO currently discuss e-commerce under a joint initiative and moratorium, consisting of 89 members. Further, the joint initiative on e-commerce considers topics including tariffs, customs clearance, paperless trading, online privacy and cyber security.</p>
<p>Members countries of WTO must prioritize crypto discussions before they &ldquo;start taking liberties with interpretation leading to disputes,&rdquo; Srivastava added.
</p>
<h1>Clarity on Crypto Exchanges</h1>
<p>
GTRI has sought clarity on whether crypto exchanges fall under the category of &#8216;electronic transmissions&#8217; within the scope of WTO e-commerce.</p>
<p>The negotiations need to factor in cryptos as exchanges involve digital transmission, qualifying it as an e-commerce transaction, he said.</p>
<p>The e-commerce moratorium was introduced in 1988, which restricts countries from applying customs duties on electronic transmissions. The moratorium was extended for two years in June 2022 and received opposition from India upon its continuation.</p>
<p>India argued that the moratorium adversely impacts developing nations and they need to preserve policy space for their digital advancement. It also stressed the regulation of imports, and generate revenue through custom duties.</p>

<p>Just under one year ago, the Bitcoin (BTC) market was in turmoil as panicky investors dumped their holdings in wake of the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>
<p>On November the 21<sup>st</sup> 2022, the BTC price hit its lowest level since late 2020 under $15,500, marking a 77% pullback from the all-time highs it hit in November 2021 at $69,000.</p>
<p>Whilst the collapse of FTX was the catalyst for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&rsquo;s</a> final decline in 2022, an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle from the US Federal Reserve that caught the broader market off guard was arguably the main catalyst behind the 2022 bear market.</p>
<p>However, since late 2022, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> has enjoyed a stunning reversal of fortunes.</p>
<p>At current levels just under $35,000, its price is up more than 120% from the 2022 lows and the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s pullback from its 2021 highs is now closer to 50%.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s 2023 resurgence is striking given that the macro landscape hasn&rsquo;t improved much this year.</p>
<p>Amid continued strong performance of the US economy, the Fed has continued to lift interest rates in 2023 (albeit, much more slowly and cautiously) and yields on long-term US government bonds are at multi-decade highs.</p>
<p>Whilst a sudden tightening of financial conditions in 2022 was a key reason for Bitcoin&rsquo;s 2022 bear market, the cryptocurrency has seen a strong recovery in 2023 despite financial conditions not loosening.
</p>
<h2><strong>Three Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Has Recovered Strongly in 2023</strong></h2>
<p>
Mean reversion is likely one reason why the Bitcoin market has recovered so much this year, with various metrics showing that the market became historically oversold in wake of the FTX implosion.</p>
<p>For example, as per <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/btc-mastering-mvrv">Glassnode</a>, Bitcoin&rsquo;s Market Value Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio briefly fell under 0.8 last November, something which has rarely happened in the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s history and has always previously signaled a historic buying opportunity.</p>
<figure id="attachment_123341" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123341" style="width: 923px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-123341 lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) MVRV Price Bands" width="923" height="672" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698682725-btc-mvrv-price-bands.png" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-123341" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin MVRV Price Bands / Source: Glassnode</figcaption></figure>
<p>The MVRV ratio is the current price of Bitcoin divided by its realized price (i.e. the price at which each coin last moved on the blockchain, which is taken as a proxy for the mean price investors paid for each coin).</p>
<p>The big 40% run up in Bitcoin&rsquo;s price this January was largely a result of dip-buying by high conviction long-term Bitcoin bulls.</p>
<p>That makes sense with <a href="https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/">blockchaincenter.net&rsquo;s Bitcoin Rainbow Chart</a> showing that the BTC price had been in &ldquo;basically a fire sale&rdquo; territory for much of late 2022.</p>
<figure id="attachment_123342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123342" style="width: 1562px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-123342 lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Rainbow Chart" width="1562" height="834" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698682761-screenshot-2023-10-30-111605.png" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-123342" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Rainbow Chart / Source: blockchaincenter.net</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whilst mean reversion got the 2023 bull market going, two further narratives powered it on.</p>
<p>Firstly, Bitcoin saw a sudden spike higher in March when fears of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/another-bank-down-crypto-friendly-signature-bank-closed-over-systemic-risk-concerns-what-does-this-mean-for-crypto.htm">US bank crisis</a> began to affect the market.</p>
<p>This impressive performance alongside the prices of gold and bonds (which also pumped at the time) boosted the idea that, just as Bitcoin maximalists have been screaming for year, BTC is a safe haven against the failings of the current financial system and is not a risk asset.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Bitcoin has again been flexing its muscles as a safe haven, gaining whilst US stocks and bonds perform poorly in unison amid concerns about 1) the still strong US economy implying higher interest rates for longer from the Fed and 2) amid geopolitical concerns amid the Israel/Hamas war.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has also been expanding its dominance within the crypto space, as worries about a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uss-crypto-crackdown-blessing-disguise-for-other-nations.htm">US regulatory crack down drive a flight to quality</a> &ndash; BTC&rsquo;s dominance recently hit its highest since April 2021 above 53%.</p>
<p>Secondly, optimism about institutional adoption has flooded back to support the market ever since <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-blackrock-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-can-btc-hit-100000-if-it-approved.htm">BlackRock</a> and a wave of other major Wall Street asset managers filed to create spot Bitcoin ETFs back in June.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-could-hit-42k-if-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-approved-matrixport.htm'">growing optimism that approvals are coming late this year/in early 2023, has helped power the latest rise in the BTC price</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_123343" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123343" style="width: 1788px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-123343 lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="" width="1788" height="732" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698682825-btc.png" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-123343" class="wp-caption-text">BTC Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>How High Can This Bitcoin Bull Market Run?</strong></h2>
<p>
In prior Bitcoin bull markets, the MVRV ratio has consistently climbed to extreme levels above 3.2.</p>
<p>An MVRV ratio of 3.2 is currently around $65,800, but its worth noting that Bitcoin&rsquo;s realized price has historically pumped during bull markets &ndash; in 2020 to 2021, the realized price ramped up from around $5,000 to a peak of around $25,000.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the realized price (last just above $20,000) rises by 5x once again to around $100,000 during the upcoming bull market.</p>
<p>Well, if Bitcoin was to hit an MVRV ratio of 3.2 with a realized price of $100,000, that would imply a Bitcoin price of above $320,000, nearly 10x above current levels.</p>
<p>Assuming Bitcoin was to reach such levels in 2025 or 2026, that would be consistent with the BTC price returning to &ldquo;sell. Seriously, SELL!&rdquo; and &ldquo;maximum bubble territory&rdquo;, according to blockchaincenter.net&rsquo;s Rainbow Chart.</p>
<p>A BTC price of more than $300,000 would imply a market cap of close to $6 trillion.</p>
<p>That may sound a lot given Bitcoin&rsquo;s current market cap is around $676 billion.</p>
<p>But the view that Bitcoin can rival gold as a global reserve asset is becoming more mainstream, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-equates-bitcoins-future-value-human-freedom.htm">major Wall Street leaders like BlackRock&rsquo;s Larry Fink recently joining the throng of BTC supporters</a>.</p>
<p>The market capitalization of all of the world&rsquo;s gold was last over $13 trillion, as per <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/gold/marketcap/#:~:text=Estimated%20Market%20Cap%3A%20%2413.235%20T&amp;text=This%20value%20was%20obtained%20by,Council%20(End%2D2021).">CompaniesMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>Given Bitcoin&rsquo;s touted benefits over gold &ndash; the fact transfers of large amounts of value are near instant and hardly cost anything and it is much easier to take self-custody of large amounts of the asset &ndash; a market cap in the trillions doesn&rsquo;t seem too far-fetched.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-cantor-fitzgerald-grows-confident-heres-why.htm">Optimism about expected upcoming spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals</a> in the US, as well as a growing safe haven narrative as Bitcoin outperforms the falling stock and bond market are keeping the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC price</a> supported heading into a week jam-packed with a number of crucial US economic events.</p>
<p>The Fed will be announcing its latest decision on monetary policy on Wednesday, while the key monthly US jobs report and ISM PMI survey data are also slated for release.</p>
<p>Strong US economic data as of late as well as hawkish communications from the US Federal Reserve, who seemingly plan to keep interest rates high for a long time, have kept stocks on the defensive in October, making <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin&rsquo;s</a> recent outperformance striking given its strong correlation to stocks as recently as 2022.</p>
<p>Bulls continue to forecast a near-term move above $40,000 for BTC, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-doubles-down-45000-bitcoin-prediction-as-fomo-grips-crypto-market.htm">Matrixport</a> recently calling for a move to at least as high as $42,000 on the official news that spot Bitcoin ETFs have secured approval in the US.
</p>
<h2><strong>This Indicator Suggests Whales Are Waking Up</strong></h2>
<p>
On-chain data supports the notion that excitement is building up in the Bitcoin market.</p>
<p>The number of <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/BTC/deep-dive?group=financials&amp;chart=largeTransactions&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_CXTpqEzTQobWgwyr6N-wzW_MV2bVxq1wl-MxtMqLjcMZD_VTZST3RSYur6Tr8l1GFQiBy">large transactions of over $100,000 in value</a> on the Bitcoin blockchain surged to its highest level of 2023 last week, according to data presented by crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bitcoin spot ETF applications appear to have increased whales&rsquo; and institutions appetite for Bitcoin,&rdquo; IntoTheBlock noted in a <a href="https://medium.com/intotheblock/what-comes-next-for-bitcoin-after-reaching-35k-3ec0523ee892">blog post to Medium</a>, adding that &ldquo;the recent rise in institutional activity might be a harbinger for what comes in 2024&rdquo;.</p>
<figure id="attachment_123154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123154" style="width: 828px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-123154 lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Bitcoin Large Transactions" width="828" height="435" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698674404-btc-whales.webp" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-123154" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Large Transactions</figcaption></figure>
<p>The surge in large transactions unsurprisingly comes at a time when the dollar value of total transfer volumes on the Bitcoin blockchain has also been rising.</p>
<p>A seven-day exponential moving average of this metric recently hit a near-one-year high above $32.5 billion last week, as per data presented by <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/btc-core-on-chain?">Glassnode</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_123156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123156" style="width: 679px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-123156 lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Bitcoin Total Transfer Volumes" width="679" height="675" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698674431-screenshot-2023-10-30-085534.png" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-123156" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Total Transfer Volumes</figcaption></figure>
<p>The number of Bitcoin transactions has seen wild swing in recent months, with the seven-day exponential moving average hitting a new all-time high near 600,000 per day last month before pulling back aggressively and then rebounding in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Big swings in this on-chain metric like we have been seeing recently are typical during Bitcoin bull markets, which many analysts now agree we are in.</p>
<p>Spot Bitcoin ETF application approvals aren&rsquo;t the only bullish narrative being touted as likely to boost the BTC price in 2024.</p>
<p>Analysts are also pointing to the halving of the Bitcoin issuance rate (a historically bullish event), the start of a new Fed interest rate cutting cycle (meaning potential macro headwinds) and the possibility of greater clarity from regulators and Congress in the US as having the potential to boost the BTC price.</p>

<p>El Salvador&rsquo;s President, Nayib Bukele has formally filed for re-election in next year&#8217;s polls, a move critics say is against the country&rsquo;s constitution.</p>
<p>Bukele and his running mate Vice President Ulloa officially registered as his party&rsquo;s candidate before the deadline on Thursday, described as a last-minute spectacle following hospitalization rumours.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1f8-1f1fb.png" alt="🇸🇻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele to stand for re-election. </p>
<p>He has a 91% approval rating. <a href="https://t.co/ezZVSBEnT9">pic.twitter.com/ezZVSBEnT9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1718323733666902222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s action comes after he made his intentions known last year due to the wide public support he received for reviving the nation&#8217;s economy and fostering security.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>We are ready to change whatever we have to change to be able to insert ourselves even more in the community of nations, but always respecting our sovereignty and independence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>
While his supporters cheer him on for another term, critics say he lacks the constitutional backing to go into another election.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>Bukele in constitutional dilemma&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
According to the country&rsquo;s constitution, Bukele is prohibited from seeking another term of five years even though the court ruled in his favor raising speculation on a possible law violation.</p>
<p>In 2021, the nation&rsquo;s Supreme Court made a ruling<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-el-salvador-9dcbdb58df7fec5b43b289c3eb269730"> that permits a second term</a> for the President. At the time, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal noted that it had accepted the decision that cannot be appealed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opposition parties and activist groups raised alarm over the court&#8217;s decision describing Bukele as an authoritarian ruler with comments on the forthcoming election being a &ldquo;<i>farce.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Critics argue that the court&#8217;s judges that allowed Bukele&rsquo;s re-election were appointed by the legislature controlled by the ruling party with talks that are against the regular pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian A. Nichols U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs in a visit to the country stated that it is not a decision for foreigners but for citizens.&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There has to be a broad debate about the legality and legitimacy of the election, but it is a debate for Salvadorans. They will have the opportunity to express their will at the polls, and they can decide whether they agree or disagree with that process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Pro-Bitcoin stance rallies support&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
Bukele rose to power in 2019 following his party, Neuva Ideas win at the general elections putting an end to the stronghold of the top two dominant parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance and the Farabundo Mart&iacute; National Liberation Front (FMNLB).</p>
<p>Known as a pro-Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) candidate, his tenure has seen the country go <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/netcoinsca-celebrates-crypto-milestone-with-el-salvadors-use-of-bitcoin-as-legal-tender.htm">bullish on the top crypto asset</a> with huge purchases and accompanying legislation for the wider industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the world of cryptocurrency, excitement continues to ripple through the market as <a href="https://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> holds steady at $34,274, registering a 0.75% increase on this Monday.</p>
<p>Beyond the price action, the crypto community finds itself ignited by the joyful tweet from none other than Elon Musk.</p>
<p>While the pro-Bitcoin stance of Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, makes headlines, it is Musk&#8217;s tweet that has garnered appreciative reactions and intensified enthusiasm within the crypto space.</p>
<p>Amid these developments, a report by Bloomberg sheds light on CZ&#8217;s wealth, revealing that the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, maintains a net worth exceeding $17 billion despite the challenges faced by the exchange this year.
</p>
<h2>Pro-Bitcoin President Bukele Announces Reelection Campaign</h2>
<p>
Nayib Bukele, the pro-Bitcoin president of El Salvador, has formally announced his candidacy for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/salvadoran-leader-makes-re-election-bid-official-2023-10-27/">reelection in the nation&#8217;s February 2024</a> presidential election.</p>
<p>Some detractors contend that Bukele is not allowed to run for office a second time in a row in El Salvador due to the constitution, despite his considerable popularity and the support of his party, Nuevas Ideas. However, the nation&#8217;s Supreme Court decided in favor of successive presidential elections in September 2021.</p>
<p>With around 70% of voters in the nation supporting Bukele&#8217;s Nuevas Ideas party, the party is well-supported and leads its rivals by a wide margin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="es" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1f8-1f1fb.png" alt="🇸🇻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />| ÚLTIMA HORA: Al grito de “cinco más, cinco más y ni un paso atrás” Nayib Bukele da su discurso delante de miles de Salvadoreños luego de inscribir su candidatura presidencial para la reelección. “Necesitamos 5 años para seguir mejorando nuestro país.” <a href="https://t.co/ApaP8yyQBm">pic.twitter.com/ApaP8yyQBm</a></p>

<p>The nation&#8217;s economic environment has changed significantly as a result of the government&#8217;s support of the Bitcoin initiative and other tech-friendly regulations.</p>
<p>VanEck strategic advisor Gabor Gurbacs has emphasized El Salvador&#8217;s potential to develop into a financial center in the Americas.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In terms of cost, the price of Bitcoin is presently on the rise. The announcement of Bukele&#8217;s reelection campaign, together with El Salvador&#8217;s ongoing support for Bitcoin, has likely helped boost market sentiment, with Bitcoin gaining ground as a result.
</p>
<h2>Elon Musk&#8217;s Tweet Sparks Crypto Enthusiasm</h2>
<p>
Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk celebrated the anniversary of his October 2022 takeover of Twitter with a tweet that highlighted the platform&#8217;s newfound &#8220;freedom.&#8221; Musk&#8217;s path to ownership was a winding one that included a substantial investment in Twitter shares, being turned down for a board position, and initially having a purchase bid rejected.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Freedom <a href="https://t.co/aIZXUJbhGc">https://t.co/aIZXUJbhGc</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1717917213301055508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk made significant modifications to Twitter after finally acquiring the firm for $44 billion. He rebranded the site as X, expanded content possibilities, introduced monetization and subscription capabilities, and streamlined operations.</p>
<p>As a result, the platform now boasts 500 million monthly active users.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When Elon Musk acquired Twitter, he pledged to turn it into an “everything app.” One year in, much of his vision has yet to play out. <a href="https://t.co/dvZ2c5RIUp">https://t.co/dvZ2c5RIUp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1717347823224569941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Bitcoin community thanked Musk for &#8220;freeing the bird&#8221; in response to his post, citing Bitcoin as a symbol of financial independence.</p>
<p>Given his previous hints, many have wondered if Musk will incorporate Dogecoin into X.</p>
<p>Notably, Musk&#8217;s comment and his ongoing involvement in the cryptocurrency field may have contributed to the recent price increase of Bitcoin.
</p>
<h2>CZ&#8217;s Billion-Dollar Worth Amid Binance&#8217;s Challenges</h2>
<p>
Reports indicate that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-26/binance-founder-cz-loses-12-billion-on-crypto-trading-slump">decreased crypto trading volumes</a> have led to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) experiencing a significant reduction in his fortune, estimated at around $12 billion.</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s data shows that Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency trading platform, has seen a 38% decline in its trading volumes this year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trading Slump Wiped $12 Billion From Binance Founder’s Fortune, Bloomberg Says<a href="https://t.co/Rm5F4Ek9Vu">https://t.co/Rm5F4Ek9Vu</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Morgan (@johnmorganFL) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmorganFL/status/1718519377966862760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Consequently, CZ&#8217;s estimated net worth has dropped to $17.2 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This decrease in revenues for Binance can be attributed to the decline in trading volumes throughout 2023.</p>
<p>Binance&#8217;s market share also declined from 62% in the first quarter to 51% by the end of the third quarter, following a zero-fee trading campaign.</p>
<p>Binance has faced various challenges and regulatory constraints in the United States. Nevertheless, Bitcoin&#8217;s price remains positive today, seemingly unaffected by this development.
</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction</strong></h2>
<p>
Analyzing the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBk8q7xJqCAxWZVPEDHeCPAYYQvOMEKAB6BAgMEAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptonews.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-price-prediction-btc-steady-near-34000-amid-etf-buzz-uk-law-ftxs-crypto-shift.htm&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bMY4dlWTT1VB-DN6TSN-y&amp;opi=89978449">daily Bitcoin chart</a>, we find the pivot point at $33,920, coinciding with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Immediate resistance levels stand at $34,500, followed by $35,250 and $36,150.</p>
<p>On the downside, support is expected at $33,000, aligning with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, followed by $32,450 and $31,800, corresponding to the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements.</p>
<figure id="attachment_122436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122436" style="width: 1725px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-122436 size-full lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart - Source: Tradingview" width="1725" height="955" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698644742-image-56.png" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-122436" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s chart patterns reveal stability above a double bottom support at $33,450, with the 23.6% Fibonacci level preventing significant downtrends. A consolidation phase is evident, suggesting investors await a catalyst for a substantial breakout.</p>
<p>In summary, Bitcoin&#8217;s overall trend leans bullish, particularly above $33,900. A breach below this level may indicate a bearish trend.</p>
<p>Considering technical indicators and market conditions is crucial due to crypto&#8217;s volatility. In the coming days, Bitcoin could test the $34,500 resistance, but traders should stay vigilant and make informed decisions.

<p>Analysts at financial services firm <strong>Cantor Fitzgerald</strong> believe the long-awaited spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin ( BTC)</a> exchange-traded fund (ETF) is inching closer to reality.</p>
<p>The company, known for its prime brokerage and investment banking services, has grown confident in the approval of applications from asset managers seeking to launch a spot ETF for Bitcoin, as <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/cantor-is-increasingly-confident-a-bitcoin-spot-will-win-approval" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a> by Bloomberg News.</p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been hesitant to approve a spot bitcoin ETF due to concerns about potential manipulation on offshore spot platforms.</p>
<p>However, Cantor Fitzgerald believes that the market surveillance procedures proposed by new applicants could address these worries and sway the SEC towards approval.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s analysts Josh Siegler and Will Carlson emphasized the importance of establishing a &#8220;comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size&#8221; to appease regulators.</p>
<p>The approval of a spot ETF would have significant short-term implications for the price of bitcoin, according to Cantor Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>They described it as a pivotal moment for the long-term adoption and legitimization of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The analysts consider the approval of a spot ETF as the most crucial short-term catalyst for the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>The SEC has previously rejected several proposals for a spot ETF, citing concerns about the lack of information sharing among exchanges to prevent market manipulation.</p>
<p>However, BlackRock, which submitted its proposal in June, has entered into an agreement with Coinbase to detect and address any irregularities in the market.
</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Surges Amid Optimism Around Spot Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>
The anticipation of a spot ETF approval has led to a surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency rallied towards $35,000 earlier this month, driven by market speculation surrounding the potential approval of a spot ETF.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto financial services platform <strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Matrixport</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-could-hit-42k-if-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-approved-matrixport.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has predicted</span></a> a major Bitcoin rally if a spot ETF hits the market.</p>
<p>Comparing this to the precious metals ETFs, which have a market cap of around $120 billion, assuming that 10-20% of precious metal ETF investors consider diversifying into a Bitcoin ETF as a hedge against monetary debasement and inflation, Matrixport said we could witness an inflow of $12 to $24 billion into the Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Tether&rsquo;s market cap increases by $24 billion, acting as a proxy for potential ETF inflows, Bitcoin&rsquo;s price would rise to $42,000, representing a conservative estimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another confirmation of the Bitcoin bull market, the leading cryptocurrency&rsquo;s market dominance <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dominance-reaches-54-as-leading-cryptocurrency-sustains-rally-amid-spot-etf-optimism.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has reached 54%</span></a>, its highest level in more than two and a half years.</p>
<p>The steady increase in Bitcoin dominance, starting from around 38% at the beginning of the year, comes amid its year-long rally, with the flagship cryptocurrency surging by 81% since the start of 2023.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction</strong></h2>
<p>
Diving into the daily chart for our analysis, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBk8q7xJqCAxWZVPEDHeCPAYYQvOMEKAB6BAgMEAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptonews.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-price-prediction-btc-steady-near-34000-amid-etf-buzz-uk-law-ftxs-crypto-shift.htm&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bMY4dlWTT1VB-DN6TSN-y&amp;opi=89978449">pivot point for Bitcoin</a> is marked at $33,920, which interestingly coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. As for resistance levels, the immediate resistance lies at $34,500, followed by $35,250 and then at $36,150.</p>
<p>On the flip side, immediate support is expected at $33,000, which aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This is trailed by support levels at $32,450 and $31,800, mirroring the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, respectively.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) value stands at 57. This value, slightly above the midpoint, reflects a bullish sentiment in the market, showcasing a prevailing buying momentum.</p>
<p>Additionally, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for Bitcoin is recorded at $32,800. Since Bitcoin&#8217;s current price floats above this EMA, it signals a short-term bullish trend.</p>
<figure id="attachment_122266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122266" style="width: 1719px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-122266 size-full lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" width="1719" height="952" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698488510-btc.jpg" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-122266" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>Observing the daily chart patterns, Bitcoin seems to be in a strong position, staying consistently above a double bottom support level of $33,450. Moreover, the 23.6% Fibonacci level is holding back any substantial downtrend.</p>
<p>An evident red box on the chart indicates a phase of consolidation, suggesting that investors might be on the lookout for a solid reason to trigger a significant breakout.
</p>
<h3>Summing Up</h3>
<p>
In conclusion, the overarching trend for Bitcoin leans bullish, especially if it manages to hover above the $33,900 threshold. Conversely, if it breaches below this level, a bearish trend might be on the horizon.</p>
<p>Given the current indicators and market pulse, it&#8217;s plausible that Bitcoin could attempt to test the resistance level of $34,500 in the ensuing days.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s essential for traders to be vigilant, considering both the technical markers and global market conditions, as the crypto domain is notoriously volatile. Making informed decisions based on a mix of these indicators is always the most prudent approach.

<p>Further bolstering its position, the US SEC, under the leadership of Chair Gary Gensler, is currently reviewing applications for 8&ndash;10 spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>As investors and enthusiasts worldwide keenly observe these unfolding events, many are asking: where is BTC heading next?&nbsp;This <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-builds-new-support-at-34500-when-is-the-next-leg-up.htm">Bitcoin price prediction</a> aims to address that very question.
</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Unrest: How the Israel-Hamas Conflict Influences Global Sentiment</h2>
<p>
As Israeli ground forces escalate their operations, the intensity of Israel&#8217;s shelling of Gaza, particularly in the northern sector, continues to rise. The UN General Assembly, in a non-binding resolution, has called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Health and humanitarian organizations express deep concern for the well-being of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, as the area faces a near-total communication blackout.</p>
<p>Negotiations between Israel and Hamas, facilitated by Qatar, are reportedly progressing and have reached an advanced stage. Since October 7, over 7,326 Palestinians have tragically lost their lives due to Israeli strikes, while more than 1,400 have perished from Hamas attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>In light of these significant global events, Bitcoin&#8217;s price appears to be experiencing a boost, with BTC&#8217;s value increasing in response to the unfolding situation.</p>
<p>As the geopolitical landscape becomes more tumultuous, many are exploring investment alternatives as a safeguard, contributing to the rise in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While Gensler did not enumerate the specific eight to ten Bitcoin ETF applications under SEC scrutiny, available public records reveal that there are a total of twelve such applications awaiting review.</p>
<p>Among these, applications from prominent firms such as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmOr_wZiCAxXUg_0HHRC2DAEQFnoECCgQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptonews.com%2Fnews%2Fark-invest-bets-big-meta-platforms-robinhood-reduces-coinbase-position.htm&amp;usg=AOvVaw3wITUO6wPq20RQmKnVit9e&amp;opi=89978449">ARK Investment Management</a>, Grayscale, Bitwise, Fidelity, VanEck, and Invesco stand out.</p>
<p>Initial market reactions to the news hinted at a surge in optimism, with speculations of potential upticks in Bitcoin ETF approvals.
</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction</strong></h2>
<p>
Bitcoin&#8217;s key point is at $33,920, marking the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The immediate upper resistance is at $35,185, followed by $36,100 and $36,975.&nbsp;Conversely, the primary support stands at $33,130, with further supports at $32,460 and $31,825.</p>
<p>The RSI, a measure of price movement speed, stands at 60, hinting at a mild bullish sentiment. The Stochastic Oscillator shows a high 92.327, suggesting potential overbought conditions and a possible price correction.</p>
<p>The ADX(14) gives a strong buy signal at 62, while the ATR(14) highlights significant volatility at 1288.</p>

<p>The 50 EMA, reflecting an average of the last 50 days with emphasis on recent prices, is at $33,760, indicating a short-term bullish outlook.</p>
<p>In summary, Bitcoin remains bullish above $33,920. If it drops below this, selling might intensify. In the near future, Bitcoin could challenge the $35,185 resistance.

<p>Digital assets under management have soared by 6.74% to $31.7 billion after a string of positive developments amid wider market uncertainties.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/digital-asset-management-review-october-2023">market report released by CCData</a> shows growth in crypto-related products, key activities, and a review of trading activities in the wake of plunging CEX volumes among others.</p>
<p>The biggest gainer last month remains Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/">BTC</a>) after the market leader rallied to a 16-month high trading over $35,000 before making a slight price correction.</p>
<p>BTC products market share grew by 73% this month, a better performance from its 70% rise in September. Total Bitcoin products now stand at $23 billion after notching an 11% growth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, leading altcoin Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) related products declined in market share by about 2% this month with its products valued at $6.3 billion. It was also the only major altcoin to record outflows last week.</p>
<p>Ethereum products have recorded low figures in recent weeks despite the launch of futures ETF products which several investors saw as a boost to attract a new cycle of growth.</p>
<p>Multi-asset production grew by 2.1% to $1.1 billion controlling 3.75% of the market share.
</p>
<h2>Anticipation of spot Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>
The data cited the renewed anticipation of a spot BTC ETF and institutional demand as the reasons for a rise in the price of Bitcoin and the overall growth of related products among institutional investors.</p>

As Bitcoin hovers around this pivotal price point, traders and investors are keenly watching for signs of the next potential surge.</p>
<p>With the market&#8217;s dynamics constantly evolving, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is: when will Bitcoin embark on its next leg up?
</p>
<h2><strong>Current Price and 24-hour Movement</strong></h2>
<p>
Bitcoin is presently trading at $33,960. Over the last 24 hours, it has experienced a minor setback of about 1%, with its trading volume standing impressively at approximately $16.5 billion. As the unrivaled king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin retains its #1 position on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#Analytics">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_122029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122029" style="width: 412px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-122029 size-full lazyload" src="https://cimg.co/p/no_image.svg" alt="Bitcoin Price Update" width="412" height="554" data-src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698418019-screenshot_55.jpg" data-srcset=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-122029" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Update &#8211; Spurce: Coinmarketcap</figcaption></figure>
<p>The current market capitalization is a staggering $663 billion. The circulating supply of Bitcoin is noted at 19.525 million BTC, steadily approaching its maximum threshold of 21 million BTC.
</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction</strong></h2>
<p>
The pivotal point for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwift5DLvZaCAxWzhv0HHcAdCrMQFnoECA0QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptonews.com%2Fcoins%2Fbitcoin%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0plqKpx536XCJrFXhiH4kg&amp;opi=89978449">Bitcoin</a> sits at $33,920, which is recognized as the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEy6_PvZaCAxW2gf0HHY-jCVkQFnoECCgQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptonews.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-price-prediction-btc-steady-near-34000-amid-etf-buzz-uk-law-ftxs-crypto-shift.htm&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bMY4dlWTT1VB-DN6TSN-y&amp;opi=89978449">23.6% Fibonacci retracement level</a>.&nbsp;On the upside, the immediate resistance is pegged at $35,185, with subsequent resistances at $36,100 and $36,975.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is found at $33,130 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement level). Further supports are identified at $32,460 (50% Fibonacci retracement level) and $31,825 (61.8% Fibonacci retracement level).
</p>
<h3><strong>Technical Indicators</strong></h3>
<p>
The RSI currently stands at 60. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Typically, an RSI above 70 indicates an overbought condition, while an RSI below 30 signals an oversold condition. With Bitcoin&#8217;s RSI at 60, it points towards a slightly bullish sentiment, suggesting that the buying momentum is still prevalent.</p>
<p>The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) is currently reading a high 92.327.
